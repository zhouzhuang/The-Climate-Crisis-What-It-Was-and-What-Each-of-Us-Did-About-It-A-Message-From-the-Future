The Climate Crisis: What It Was and What Each of Us Did About It (A Message From the Future)

<p>
In the words of my former climate crisis professor, "I'm here to apologize for my generation". As I stand here in 2060, it has been over a century since we discovered what fossil fuels did to our climate. We had our chance to fix our planet, but we willingly turned a blind eye to it. I remember what could've been our turning point as a species. The 2020 election. Being the stereotypical college liberal that I was, I fully endorsed and supported Bernie Sanders. Bernie outlined an incredibly comprehensive green new deal that targeted every major source of greenhouse gas emissions and explained, in detail, how to reduce them. However, fearful of the big numbers and label of "socialist", the American people voted how they always have, and voted into office a watered-down moderate. Joe Biden, although a democrat in name, fully supported fracking and had no plans to address the climate crisis other than to "rejoin the Paris climate agreement". However, fearful of change, the American public clung onto this "stability" and turned down our best chance at true climate reform. While Co2 emissions did drop down slightly with Biden in office, it didn't make much of a difference due to the massive increase in methane emissions from fracking and reliance on natural gas. However, other countries took a different path. The grassroots movements never stopped. The bottom-up approach grew and more and more people became aware of climate change and were willing to change their lifestyles to help the environment. But it wasn't enough. The rich continued to fly annually and everyone still ordered new things on amazon every month and houses continued getting bigger and bigger. Luckily, the rest of the world did not follow in our footsteps. Europe was the beginning. By 2050, nearly all of Europe was running on renewables like solar, hydroelectric and wind turbines. More and more people biked to work and carbon taxes were implemented in nearly every country. Even China and India implemented a reasonable climate policy to help mitigate their effect on the planet. The actions of other countries did a lot to keep us from going over the tipping point. The US as the proponents of the "Free market" was the most stubborn in changing and our planet will pay for it dearly. Thanks to the rest of the world, you students are now in a similar position that I was when I was in college 40 years ago. But now, the stakes are even higher. As many of you know, many equatorial countries are uninhabitable. Island nations are now completely submerged. Bangladesh is perpetually flooded. Most of the Saharan African countries and parts of the middle east are uninhabitable. The effects of the climate crisis are no longer hard to see or abstract, they are right in front of you. Do not make the mistake of voting and endorsing "incremental change" we need radical change. As John Foster pointed out in “Capitalism and Degrowth-An Impossibility Theorem” back in 2011, "There is no way to increase the capacity of the environment to bear the economic and population burdens placed on it, it follows that the adjustment must come entirely from the other side of the equation. And since the disequilibrium has already reached dangerous proportions, it also follows that what is essential for success is a reversal, not merely a slowing down...Eco-compatible capitalism is conceivable in theory, but unrealistic in practice" Do not make the same mistake my generation made in 2020 and go out and vote for the candidate that will demand change.

this was extremely well written and thought out. It is very logical and inspired my own response. However, I hope we are both right about our optimism of the Presidential election; Joe Biden will hopefully beat Trump in the upcoming election. I hope we are right, because at this point, Biden will address the climate crisis sooner than if Trump continues in office for the next four years. It will shift America from a moderate democrat to hopefully a more progressive liberal in years to come.

I need a reply to this week, so, I am going to be responding to your comment in a way where nothing bad happened and we followed everything positive in terms of the environment. Basically, instead of the rest of the world being the leaders of the climate revolution, in my future here the US and everyone in the world led the revolution early on.
<br><br>


Dear general populous of 2020,
<br><br>


It is 2060. I am immensely proud of the American people and the people of the world for our combined effort to create a better planet. As I look back, I think of where this all started. In 2020, the American presidential election ended in former president Bernie Sanders winning. After super Tuesday of that year, I thought he surely lossed, but he came back and created a revolution mindset in the minds of young Americans and won the primary and presidency. As soon as he stepped into the oval office, president Sanders brought on a new age of not only helping unite our society, but moving our society in a path of equity of opportunity for all Americans and a better world for our future. The specific policy that led our government on a path of change was the Green New Deal. Although many of us were in opposition to it and fearful of what it would do in the economy, the majority of us believed it was the right thing to do to take a temporary hit in order to fix the world for our children. I remember looking out onto the Santa Barbara coast as a college student and seeing all the offshore fracking. Now, looking at all the sustainable energy around our country it warms my heart. I see solar panels, wind energy, geothermal energy, etc. And I know this is happening all around the world. There will never be another war over oil and we never need to worry about our energy running out. Even though many countries still rely a lot on oil, the vast majority of the population is on the brink of being completely sustainable and the first world countries are leading this revolution. We made this change early enough that everything my past professor Ken Hiltner said was going to happen in the future was nearly saved. If we didn't make this decision to change to the green new deal as early as we did, there surely would have been terrible repercussions such as the loss of cities along the Florida coast or the islands in the pacific. Fortunately, there were barely any losses of lives or forced emigration due to this. 
<br><br>
Looking back on the immense polarization of the United States in 2020 and before, I am absolutely astounded we could get to this point. I did not think that in my life most of society would unite in the commonality of one goal, or ever be able work towards that goal even though we couldn't yet see the disastrous effect we would be avoiding. Fortunately, our government and certain activists such as Greta Thunberg stepped up and showed the world how truly immense this problem is. From every one of the future, including my children, I thank the people in my generation and the generation before mine for being able to unite against the impending doom we all felt in 2020.
<br><hr>
To my future self,

<br><br>

Hey! I’m sure that when you are reading this, it will be roughly somewhere between 2050 and 2060. I hope that the journey to where you are right now has been fruitful, adventurous, and full of surprises, and I sincerely wish that everything has been well. I am writing this letter for you to read what my thoughts were in the past. 

<br><br>

I am writing this on March 9, 2020 in the San Nic office, and it’s my final assignment for a class that I took this winter quarter known as English 23, also known as “The Climate Crisis: What It is and What Each of Us Can Do About it”. This class has been one of the most life-changing classes I have ever taken, as it opened my eyes to the reality of the climate crisis and how everyday, our world is dying because of the lack of human action. I wholeheartedly express my gratitude for Ken, the TAs, and all of the students here that have helped me understand more about the global crisis.  

<br><br>

Currently, our beautiful nature and environment is slowly deteriorating. Wildfires have been raging across the planet, specifically in Australia, and natural disasters are continuing to occur day after day. Ice is melting in Antarctica and in the North/South Pole, and many third-world countries are suffering due to extreme hot weather conditions. Unfortunately, the US, which has been my home for over a decade, has not been playing a significant role in fighting the crisis, even though it is one of the major causes for the increasing number of greenhouse gas emissions into our atmosphere. 

<br><br>

Honestly, it seems extremely hopeless, and many people in the status quo perceive the crisis as a catastrophe that cannot be fixed anymore. However, it’s vital that we change this mindset. We need to understand that acknowledging and hoping that we can fight this crisis together can spark inspiration and a new flame to continue fighting. As Ken mentions, we can be whatever we have the courage to see.

<br><br>

The first step we need to take is to picture a world that is free from this climate crisis. Although I will admit that we should’ve acted 40 to 50 years ago, there is still time left for us to reconvene, brainstorm, and be innovative on how to fight this as a global community. Even if a small group of people started to do this, it can inspire others to take the fight too, and this can then spread throughout the globe.

<br><br>

One thing I want to mention is that it is absolutely understandable to be pessimistic and doubtful about this situation. There is no one in this world that would look at the current climate and crisis and think lightly of it. It is quite a difficult and laborious situation, but if we do this together, we can achieve what we imagined. Remember, it is important that we try, even if things don’t go the way we hoped or expected.

<br><br>

In the end, as you are reading this, I hope that you can confidently say that you lived a life that at least attempted to fight the crisis. Even in your 50s and 60s, I hope that you can continue to fight the climate crisis (if it’s still happening) and protect our beautiful home together.

<br><hr>
I really enjoyed reading the message you had towards the future generation about the past. Although I like to be optimistic, I felt your letter was realistic on how things might turn out. Even though I would like to believe that our country will collectively make the changes we need to do, there are still large amounts of Americans who deny climate change. I liked that you brought up the actions of other countries, because we can see that today. A lot of countries are implementing infrastructures, bike lanes, that reduce their carbon footprint. Whereas, the United States has continuously settled on accepting fossil fuel industry money over preventing our futures from being destroyed. Hopefully we can look back at this letter in the future and realize that our generation was able to come together to make the necessary change. I hope that if Biden does get elected into office like your letter said, that he proves us wrong and makes big strides towards climate action. If that doesn't happen, then I hope that our generation will make their voices heard and demand for change.
<br><hr>
I really appreciate how thoughtful and detailed your response is. Although I want to be optimistic about the future and think that everything will work out eventually, there is still a part of me that think by the time we take actions, it will be too late. I like how your imagination of the future does not just assume everything will go perfectly in the future, instead, your version of the future shows what will happen if we continue to ignore the current urgent situation and lie to ourselves. It is a wake up call for everyone right now that time is really not on our side and we should do anything we can starting right now and from little things we can do daily. 
<br><br>
Thinking about the future helped me realize that if I don't want to regret what I didn't do to stop the climate crisis and put all the pressure of saving the planet on our children, I should get over the little trouble of switching ways of transportation and changing my diet.
<br><hr>
I have the same approach and expectation as you. Unfortunately, we are both pessimism about this.
<br><br>
CNN breaking news, this is the latest news from WHO at 2060. 
<br><br>
"The WHO just finished their last meetings and they made their agreements." 
<br><br>
"Dear all, unfortunately, we have face the fact that the newest virus already killed more than 3.5 billion people globally, and we do not have any treatments for this diseases and we are unable to make vaccine for this virus. We have detect the origin of this virus, it was the 2020 coronavirus and the origin of the coronavirus was released due to the melting of north polar. At this point, there is nothing we can do. Please stay with your family, stay away from the crowd and enjoy your last days. 
<br><br>
Dear all, it is very unfortunately that we did not take actions early enough at 2020. Now, when we look back to 2020, it was obviously that 2020 was the origin of a lot issues, but we did not take actions early enough. The fires in Australia, the fires in California and the Coronavirus. It was been treated as a common cold only, the fire was only been viewed as a annual routine, the sea level rising was only been viewed not a big deal. All in all, it was the consequences of climate crisis. No body really cares, people really do not think this is a big issue, until, it generally started to be related to everyone. We start to care slowly, then we start to take actions slowly and we face other parties' voice and fight against it. And when we eventually try to work together, despite political parties, it is all too late. We left no options, and we have to admit we lost this battle to the nature.
<br><br>
Dear all, we had the chance to win this battle. Although this issue starts at 1990s, if we can react to this issue at 2020, we could still survive. If we can pay more attention to that fire in Australia, if we can start acting to the fire in California and if we can act better to the coronavirus, it would all been different. 
<br><br>
At this moment, I would like to encourage you to think about the year 2020. What were you, what did you do at that year? As I stand here today, I remember I was a freshman in college. I remember I was taking a class about global warming. The professor did an awesome job, we really learned the importance and severity about this issue. However, most of students from that class forget these things within 3 months. How ironical. All these things we are pursing and we give up for these things such as money, power, social status, the large house, the luxury vehicle we owe, the flight we are taking and the food we waste now become useless. It won't help us and this moment, we do not even care at this time. How many of you guys are still wearing the new t shirt you get? Live in your big house, sadly, we are going to die in these large house and in these new clothing. How ironical. 
<br><br>
All in all, at this moment, it is sadness for us to be regret and think why should not we act earlier. It has all been too late, unless today is still 2020, we would have no chances. Let us face the reality and take the responsibilities, we all knew about these, we knew what is going on and we knew the consequences, but we still choose another option. We choose money over the climate. Now it is our time to pay. Enjoy the last few days with your family and please do flash back your entire life and your decision made 40 years ago. Thank you all."
<br><hr>
From my personal perspective, I completely agree with you. For me I want to be optimistic about the future, but the point is right now the climate crisis still didn’t get the public’s attention, or the politicians’. The people who have the power and wealth still are being blind about it, and they are even continuing doing harmful events to the Earth. It is crucial to urge them make some changes toward it. If we are aware of the problem, we don’t have power or wealth to reduce the severity of climate change. Therefore, we need to vote and choose the right president who can perfectly take it in control.

It’s the year 2060. I am standing in front of you as a professor of the history of Climate Change and telling you what we did about it. Things have changed and some may say for the worst, but this change was necessary. I remember like it was yesterday: the day I decided to stand up to protect the environment. The year 2020 represented a time in the United States where the future was extremely uncertain. We were at risk of losing everything. And when I say everything, I dont mean the house I live in now or the car I used to drive. I mean we almost lost our humanity, our ability to live on a sustainable planet. 
<br><br>

2020 was the year I gave up meat. It wasn’t as hard as people thought it would be at the time. I had always said I was going to go vegan, but I never really had that push that drove me to finally doing it. Once that push came, it didn’t affect me negatively. I realized that our planet was worth it and if me giving up a piece of meat meant taking the first steps in the right direction, it was a no brainer. It actually made me happier. Being a climatarian made me mindful of the basic decisions I made daily. For the first time in my life I was in control of my health when I had struggled with weight fluctuations all my life. I have more energy all the time, especially to keep up with my kids that I had in years later. But I wasn’t the only one, this had become a huge trend among the generation.  
<br><br>

2020 was the year I adopted a minimalist lifestyle. I started buying less and finding value the things I owned. While this took some time to adjust and kill bad habits, reducing my carbon footprint was a challenge but I have no regrets. Living in a micro apartment was the best decision for me and my future family. It made us closer and gave us an intimate relationship that I had never experienced before. I found that other people started adopting this lifestyle as well. Once people started buying less, corporations stopped manufacturing and sweat shops closed. People started putting human rights over corporate interests. 
<br><br>

2020 was the year Donald Trump was voted out of office. Bernie Sanders was elected but still faced a Republican majority in the senate. At the time, people were optimistic. I thought maybe, just maybe The Green New Deal will be a priority on the agenda. That didn’t happen in Bernie’s first term. People were angry with this. People went to the streets and protested at the capitol in DC. They started to realize that Mitch McConnell was the problem, and in 2024, they voted him out of office too. Bernie put us back into the Paris Agreement. The Green New Deal was amended and signed into law by 2026. 
<br><br>

2032 was the year I was elected into the House of Representatives. I made health care, economic equality, and infrastructure a priority on my agenda. I wanted to make my district green. I proposed a carbon tax and requested funding to make bike safety a priority and a viable option. I made sure those that had been affected by the Green New Deal were heard and provided with feasible options to live in a green society. Most Congress men and women were doing the same thing in districts across the country. People were tired of letting climate change destroy the earth we so desperately needed to live. 
<br><br>

2060 is the year we live in now. Carbon taxes have been normalized and our carbon emissions are lower than they’ve ever been. Greta Thunberg lives on as the champion of the Climate Crisis and continues to push the envelope further until every one around the globe is equally included in protecting the environment. People bike everywhere now, all businesses switched to renewables, people are happier and better off than where they were in 2020. My generation was the generation that saved the planet. The baby boomer generation gave us a problem; we fixed it. Sacrifice and will was what got us to where we are today. We acted upon the things we knew we needed to do. Let this be a lesson to you all for the next generation: don’t take anything that is given to you for granted, life will never be guaranteed unless you fight for it.

<p>
To future generations and future ME: 

<br><br>

Looking back in time when I was around 20, because I took Ken’s Climate Crisis 101 during my freshman year, I started carrying out changes as much as I could, including personal, cultural, and political. In my opinion, it is extremely important to think about how you can bring or influence the world collectively as to promote the importance and the severity of the issue of global warming. Originally, I was unaware of the idea saying that human doings are the main effect to climate change. Yet, gaining knowledge from Ken, I came to realize how we human beings waste food and possess unessential belongings that are bringing negative impacts to our environment. 
<br><br>


Let’s say this might be just two small things that some people just won’t care about. Nevertheless, no one should really be so dumb and pure to try to ignore the problem and how they actually are “impacting” our future. It is now beginning a new decade, and as Ken mentioned at the beginning of the lecture, he had reflected on his generation and apologized to our generation for the lack of positive actions but adding burden to our generation. Although this is an action we should learn from, I hope in the future, or say 40 years from now, the next generation will appreciate the contributions we made. 
<br><br>


To start from, for me, adjusting and having good personal behaviors is the best way to influence friends and people around you to take actions. Furthermore, personal doings include political actions. I like this quote, ”A small action can bring big changes.” How to prove this? I will say that I have considered becoming a freegan or a vegan after making some adjustments and getting used to the eating habits that I’ve not done before. A freegan is someone who rejects consumerism and seeks to help the environment by reducing waste, especially by retrieving and using discarded food and other goods, whereas a vegan only eats vegetable related food. As to become successful, I will try to ask myself if making this change brings me happiness or not. If yes, then I will be grateful for myself for accepting the challenge that I have never thought about. Not everyone is comfortable in sacrificing their uncertain thoughts to make changes, but it is vital that at least we are “willing” and have the “desire” to change. 
<br><br>


Other than personal actions, cultural and political changes are also parts to make our world better. I understand that the problems we are facing now is not a small and simple issue. However, one thing we know is that humans are collective, and we can gather to bring out different behaviors. It is not the environment’s but OUR responsibility. Besides living in apartments or cohousing, we can also use less energy by turning off lights or switches after using electronically related things. In addition, we “can” be not lazy but just to promote or support the idea to vote for the influential political figures. And there are many more to say. 
<br><br>


As a result, the thing I want to support and state is that we, as human beings, should not be complaining about our situations and broken environments, instead we have to act on it and put as much effort as we can. Not only our planet can be sooner recovered but also we are helping ourselves and selflessly, others. I wish in 2060, what we see is a different world in 2020.

<p>
2020 was the year I took UCSB’s English 23 course, nicknamed “Climate Crisis 101,” on a whim. It was my first exposure into the realities and statistics of the ongoing climate crisis. I was mostly uneducated on the specific causes of climate change and what the human population urgently needed to do about it. In high school, I thought vegans were just hippies and animal lovers. I thought global warming was the only thing we needed to worry about, and it wouldn’t happen until after my lifetime. I underestimated how much waste and pollution the United State produced compared to developing countries whose population is many times larger than ours, yet produce far less emissions. Before I took English 23, I was so clueless. The class galvanized me with a sense of urgency because the devastating affects of anthropogenic climate change was occurring during my lifetime, causing deadly natural disasters and an inhabitable environment.
<br><br>


Starting 2020, I began to be mindful of the solutions Ken taught us in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. I began to eat less meat, incorporating a more plant-based diet. I tried my best to avoid riding cars by biking and riding trains and buses. I went to beach clean ups with my friends. I voted for the first time ever, and I made sure to research and vote for pro-environment candidates in the primary elections. This is probably what more than 2/3 of the 800 students in English 23 have done. Teaching the younger generation about what we need to do to avoid global disaster, which is what Ken has done, is one of the most important forms of environmental activism. The older generation’s actions have caused the crisis and they are not doing anything about it, so it is up to young people to push for change. Especially with COVID-19 revealing the flaws of almost every institutional system in America, we must rebuild everything from scratch.
<br><br>


By 2025, the younger generation has done the most important step to solve the climate crisis: get Donald Trump out of office and elect Bernie Sanders, who endorses the Green New Deal and other pro-environmental policies. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez along with other progressives will have fully developed the Green New Deal so that a carbon tax is incorporated and major cities all over the United States will have a plan to implement efficient public transportation and safe bike paths and discourage car use. There are tangible promises for job security, universal healthcare, and proper education for all. President Sanders has a solid plan to rebuild American economy so people have true equality of opportunity and fair living standards.

<br><br>

By 2030, the millennial generation and gen Z will have continued to elect progressive representatives who carry on Bernie Sander’s legacy. The changes in policy and complete rebuild of America’s infrastructure are successful at drastically reducing our emissions of carbon and equivalent gases. Although the climate crisis is far from over, we are finally doing the best we can to try and make the planet safe and habitable for future generations to come.

I'd like to thank you for your current contribution to environmental protection, such as cleaning the beach and so on. At the same time, I also agree with your plan for the future. I am not a trump supporter like you. It's not about politics, it's not about economics. I don't want to comment on what he's doing in politics because politics is very complicated and it's not easy to say who's right or who's wrong. But in terms of environmental protection, I think trump is unqualified. I am an international student. I have been in the United States for four years, and trump has been in office for nearly four years. In these four years, I have not seen the government's actions on environmental protection, nor have I seen people's living habits change. People still waste food as much as they do, and there is no less enthusiasm for beef. My neighbor next door bought a third car, and there are only two people in their family. I really think you need a new and better leader! Only in this way can the United States really become stronger, instead of creating bubbles to immerse people in numb false prosperity.

A message from the future:
<br><br>



The year is 2060, and to be straightforward, it’s the end of Earth and possibly us humans. At the current state, the planet Earth as you may know it is pretty much uninhabitable as the air is filled with so dusts and toxic particles. Dust storms are a norm and most of the agricultural crops have died and become extinct due to blights affecting the crops and the said dust storms. Most water sources have also become unable to be consumed. More than half of the world's population has been decimated through famine. Technologies have also come to a standstill, personal computer s have become luxury items. There is also no military or war anymore. 

<br><br>


The start of our downfall started with in the 2020. Even though the average people have become more aware of the severity of the climate crisis, it wasn’t enough. The relationship between various anti-climate groups got very close. Soon after, these industrial giants and big companies formed lobby groups to buy and control the congress. The majority of the youth did not vote to change how the congress is controlled by these people who didn’t care for climate changes. And things went south extremely quickly.
<br><br>



Our last chance to mitigate the climate crisis was 2020. I beg whoever is reading this to not repeat the humanity’s mistakes, and to please act now.

After reading your letter from the future, I start to worry about our current situation. As we all known, the coronavirus is wide spreading in this earth. In my opinion, that's nature's punishments to our human being. If we don't do anything from now on, the world will become something like you have wrote in this letter, the air would smell like toxic and there would be full of trash on the earth, we successfully turns our earth into a forbid zone. I guess the situation could be much worse than we can imagine. Due to the reason that all the ice in the Arctic was melted, they would release some new and fatal virus that we have never met before. Some of those virus might cause the extinction of human being. Because we have never something terrible like that. We should stop testing and destroy our nature.
<br><hr>

When you said that " it's the end of Earth and possibly us humans", I feel touched but the year is 2060. Right now, in 2020, I feel like that it is the end of the world already. Until now, we still have no clue where exactly is the Coronavirus originated and how are we going to stop this virus madness happen around the world. And some people still will not take this situation seriously. If humanity ends here, not to mention future life in 40 years from now. This is a situation that might signify the downfall of humanity, which I totally agree with you. As I am replying to your comment right now, it is so dark outside and it is raining. I get pretty sad and upset when the rain starts. Especially in a critical moment like now, I feel the Earth wants to stop functioning and it wants to punish humanity from all the scars that we made to earth. I really do not know how are we going to make through this. For me, I feel helpless and lonely, at this time in a foreign country away from my family. But, I am still lucky to have all of my friends right now that we are here for each other here in a foreign country. People's hearts are corrupted, the environment is corrupted as well. Are we able to sustain ourselves still?  At the moment, nothing functions normally as it was --- the city is locked down and the rise of racism increases rapidly, even the stock market had broken down; moreover, hundreds of flights are being canceled, but it could be something beneficial to the environment that fewer emissions will be made through air travel.  I still remember that people were looking forward to starting 2020 as a good year with so many wishes; nevertheless, the beginning of 2020 has already turned into a disaster. But I still have faith in humanity and I always believe in an old Chinese saying that " The beginning of everything is difficult"; and I believe that 2020 will be better and better that people are strong. With all of this, I have a letter from the future.

A letter from 2060,
<br><br>


If this letter appears, that means I or the human has survived from the pandemic of Coronavirus and survived from the horrible 2020.
<br><br>


Within all the years of working, the environment is getting better and getting. The coronavirus wakes people up that it is stupid to keep being ignorant. We should face the problems around us and find ways to solve it so that we can better sustain ourselves.

<br><br>

Now, we have better energy to use and that will cause zero damage to the earth. Not to mention that it is affordable for all people. There are new ways of traveling that cost zero damage to the environment and much and much faster transportations. The fuel-required cars were out decades ago. Humans now live a very sustainable life.

<br><br>

It is years and years of working and changing that leads to where we are today in 2060. Do not forget the development process and how hard it was. People should look ahead and do not wait when everything is too late.
<br><br>
The end of the Letter.
<br><br>


I really hope that we have better lives and a better environment in the future. So that earth is still sustainable for generations after generations. Let's be honest, the scientists came out the topic of moving another planet years ago. Have we found a planet that is suitable for human beings yet? The answer is no. There is no other planet like the earth that is the most perfect planet for the human to live. If we do not cherish it now, it just a matter of time that we will regret that why did not we act earlier. Take a small step first, and let that small step becomes the start of "protecting the environment" journey.

In late 2019, as I was desperately scrambling for classes to find for the winter quarter, I stumbled upon English 23/Climate Crisis 101. To my surprise, this class was extremely informative and one of the first things I learned was how ignorant I was on the subject. I was in this class during a very pivotal year for the US: 2020. We all knew that the 2020 election will determine our future for the rest of the decade. With pivotal policies like the Green New Deal, this can be a true turning point for our planet.
<br><br>
Fast forward. It is now 2030 and 10 years ago I was an optimistic 19-year-old college freshman with high hopes for the decade. But the 2020 election was effectively the final nail in the coffin for humanity. It did not go the way many people were hoping for and all our hopes for saving the planet and stopping the crisis were diminished. Pardon my french but we were fucked. Our planet continued to diminish and with every natural disaster, the death toll continued to rise and rise. Global temperatures raised another 3 degrees celsius, many iconic animals became extinct or extremely protected, global conflicts escalated and wars were started over resource shortages and all life as we knew it was being called into question. 
<br><br>
Fast forward. It is now 2040 and humanity has spent the past 10 years trying to right the wrongs of the past. Radical change has finally come but it may be too late. All plastics are now banned, now every US citizen has to pay a carbon tax, and meat is taxed extremely high. All these measures were met with extreme backlash especially from the ultra-rich but our government has finally realized that the climate crisis is truly a global threat that we as a society effectively shot ourselves in the foot. 
<br><br>
Fast forward. As 2050 is rolling around humanity is beginning to flourish again. Gasoline-powered vehicles are completely gone and all transportation is electric. The global temperature has returned to a healthy state but the damage our planet has sustained is permanent. Humanity is doing its best with what’s left. If only we would’ve got it right 30 years ago. 
<br><br>
Fast forward. Here I am 59 years old reflecting back on the past 40 years. Thinking back on 2020 when my Professor Ken Hiltner gave me all this information about our current climate crisis at the time. If only more people back then were given the same information I was maybe we wouldn’t have gone through such dire times. It’s a shame that our generation was only able to come together to change only after intense tragedy.

Letter to self: 
<br><br>

In the year 2019 I made the choice to take a course on the Climate Crisis offered at UCSB. I made this choice without knowing much about the climate crisis, but something inside me, that curiosity that I have always had drove me to take it. I grew up hearing about sea level rises and the extinction of species, but I never went further into questioning or wanting to learn more. This class provides me with what I need to know and what I could do to mitigate this issue. Throughout the quarter I felt overwhelmed learning about mass extinctions, the wildfires destroying homes, and even how the climate crisis is tied to other injustices. I was desperate to find solutions, but mostly I wanted to figure out how to take this knowledge and utilize it to take action. I knew that in order to have change, I had to be the change myself. This change was more step-by-step, I adapted a plant based diet, used public transportation, wasted less food, and found ways to educate myself about the planet. I also discovered that there was more to do, like voting and joining organizations. This class taught me something else: the power we all have to change the world. 
<br><br>

2020 has just started, but not much has been done to mitigate the climate crisis. Fossil fuel companies are thriving, people are dying, and the world is in flames. Little political action is being taken on behalf of our government. Our culture is dependent on the belief that happiness comes with owning the best and having the most. This has driven to mass consumption and the exploitation of workers. Countries are paying the cost for our consumption. I fear that this will never change. When will our country take into full account that we have largely contributed to the climate crisis? 
<br><br>

Yet, there are those who care and are advocating for a better tomorrow. In 2020, we have movements such as Greta Thunberg’s Friday’s for Future. She inspires millions from all over the world. She is one of the reasons why I still have hope. At UCSB we also have students and instructors who use their knowledge to make a difference, not only in our campus, but in our community of Isla Vista. Despite everything, I feel hope. I truly believe that there can still be change. We can save our planet.
<br><br>

I hope communication was used to mitigate the climate crisis along with policy change. Is climate denial still as effective as it was in the earlier decades, in trying to win the people and turn them against scientists? Have more species become extinct due to anthropogenic causes? I am hoping that things have gotten better, that we accepted the fact that we need to change culturally, and altogether stop the use of fossil fuels. One of the most important things that I learned in this class is that we should stop air travel. Slow travel is one way to interact with the world and with people. One of the things I cherish is a life of growth and learning from people’s stories, and I believe we can all do the same. To end this, I would like to tell you that I have not lost hope. Everyday I wake up and see the beauty of earth and the ways we can preserve and continue to care for it.

A "Thank You" Speech to the world as I win an award for my cartoon series:
<br><br>


Today is a big year for me, 2060. Not because I just won an award for my creation, but because it has been 40 years since I took the most important college course that I have ever taken: English 23. Ah yes, I can still remember it if it was just yesterday: I was a newborn freshman in UCSB, taking a class called English 23 because it fulfilled my GE requirement. Not only that, but I took it because it was a lecture based around a subject I was heavily passionate about: climate change. I claimed myself to be an "activist" before taking that class because I believed global warming was real, but I was hypocritical by doing many of the things that a climate activist would not do. But once I stepped into English 23 and began to learn about what climate change can do and what we can do to stop it, I realize I had a lot of work to do before I could call myself an activist.
<br><br>


2020 was the year where there was a lot of tension within my generation, us dealing with the issue of climate change while politicians and big money corporations tried to convince us that it wasn't real. Us dealing with awareness that the world is on fire and dying, while the sense of selfish capitalism began to brainwash us to think that all we needed were Airpods, Supreme, and the latest car. Us dealing with many political tensions and clashes between political parties, to the point where more chaos erupted or nothing got done. We just had a lot to witness, and we were considered the ones "too young to understand/make a difference" by the generation before us. But many of us still had the strong, undying spirit to make a change in this broken world, so much so that 2020 was the year of political activism, to make sure climate change can be seen as a real threat to ourselves and the planet we call home.
<br><br>


After 2020, we were able to finally use our voices and push forward the "Green New Deal" once we realized that if we wanted to make a difference, it had to be at the polls. I remember my first time voting, I was so thrilled and excited to show people your vote counts, even if it feels like it does not. We were able to grow, share to the world that these capitalistic idea of the "American Dream" is not realistic nor healthy. We were able to change the world that the last generation did not care about, it was about the "me" for them, for us it was about the "we" mentality. It was a long and hard fight, especially against those who did not want to change because of their desire for money. It was a long and hard fight to tell our friends, our family, our classmates, our neighbors, anyone about climate change and how it is real and how we only have a small window to change and rewrite our destiny towards death. It was long and hard, but we did it.
<br><br>


So, if my generation finally did it, then what is the point of me giving this speech in the first place? Well, it's because I want YOU all to carry the torch now. I am doing a call to action towards all of you, to not let our success die off so quickly. Help us carry the reigns of making our carbon emissions down 2 degrees Celsius, help us keep the "Green New Deal" going, help us by doing personal and political action against the terrors of climate change and the non-believers. I made this cartoon for both entertainment and as a way to tell people the problems of our world and how we need to fix it. I have made several episodes dedicated in teaching people about climate change and how we can do our part to make our situation better. I did it because it was my duty as an environmental activist and as a content creator to make people become critical citizens, not just mindless consumers.

<br><br>

Today is the year 2060, and I am calling for all of you watching to make a difference now. Continue the fight, because even though we believe we have won the war, issues will always come crawling back. YOU are the next generation to keep the fight going, YOU are the next generation to keep our Earth green and alive, YOU are the next generation we believe in, YOU are the next generation that can make sure our mistakes throughout human history doesn't repeat ever again, YOU ARE THE NEXT GENERATION!
<br><br>


I believe in you, and not just me, but the rest of my generation as well.
<br><br>
Keep the fight going.

<p>
To my dear kids,
<br><br>


When I was your age (40 years ago), I took my first climate change class. Before, both in high school and in other college courses my teachers and professors highlighted the extreme consequences of the climate crisis that will come very soon if we didn’t take any real monumental steps in the right direction, but I never fully grasped the true devastation that humans caused in the world. I didn’t understand that us, living in the United States, live such easy and hypocritical lives compared to those living in developing countries around the world. I used to buy so many unnecessary items, such as jeans with rips at different parts of them, jackets that I didn’t need, and shoes that I never wore. I felt justified because I thought that the people who were making these clothing items were paid well, lived good and healthy lives, and were safe at work. The climate crisis class I told you about earlier in this letter was the first to really open my eyes to the injustices happening in developing countries predominantly. In Bangladesh, thousands of workers die from unsafe working conditions just to make clothes that are cheap for us. They are separated from their children for most of the year and many die due to diseases from the chemicals at their factories. All of this, just to make our country and other developed countries feel like we always need more and more because these companies are making more and more. This class truly changed my outlook on life, and from that moment on I felt a change within me.

<br><br>

 This class showed me the injustices happening around the world that are harming less-well of people and our own environment. From deforestation to high extinction rates, we were ruining the environment one second at a time. And, what made this so much worse, is that our own government, who I believed in so much, was allowing this to happen. Politicians were backed up by oil corporations and continued to deny anthropogenic climate change because it didn’t suit their agenda. This frustrated me and made me want to make a difference in the world. I began working with other students I met in this class who felt as angry as me, and we decided to stand up and make our voices heard. We got a lot of students who believed in the consequences of climate change and we had weekly meetings. We taught people who didn’t know how to communicate about climate change and gave them the tools that would help them talk to their families about the right things to do regarding climate change. We gave everyone at our meetings (which weekly came to be 230 students!!!) a goal to tell 10 family members or friends--who they knew or thought didn’t fully see the problem of the climate crisis and fossil fuels--what is really happening around the world due to climate change, how us Americans have perpetuated climate change, and what the easiest way to make a difference is...Vote! Everyone came back after spring break and was ecstatic because they truly felt like they made their family and friends see the importance of voting for the right candidates who will make sweeping political and cultural changes to fix this horrible and disastrous problem. We tabled twice a week to give more people more information about the issue and the following school year (when we came back from summer break) we got even more passionate as it got closer to the general election of 2020. We held rallies, got people invigorated, and made most of our school see how we can make a change by voting and giving out information to those ‘Uncle Petes’ in our world. We felt so confident that the 2020 election was going to end the way we wanted it to. Then, as November 3rd came around, we worked harder than ever. We got people who didn’t want to go to the polls to vote for the candidate we knew would fight to save the environment. As the results steadily came out, state by state, we grew less and less confident. Then, as many swing states’ results came out, we started cheering. When we realized that the president and the Senate both would make political changes (in legislation) to mitigate the climate crisis, we knew that all our hard work paid off. 

<br><br>

 This was just the beginning. We finally got someone into office that would change America’s perception of what climate change is and how real it is. This made more and more people want to change their own lifestyles and continue to vote in politicians who weren’t backed by fossil fuel corporations and did support the crisis climate change truly was. Since then, the Green New Deal became real legislation that the United States had to strictly follow. We committed once again to the Paris Accords and helped developing countries prosper while we and other developed countries ended the use of fossil fuels. Once the developing countries could stand on their own two feet without fossil fuels, they also switched to sustainable energy sources. I never felt as proud of myself as I did when this change happened. In college, I didn’t know where life would take me or what my passion would end up being. Climate Crisis 101 changed that for me and made me want to put my whole life into the climate crisis. Now that the environment will be safe and healthy as we continue in this path, I hope that you can see that all of what I did as you guys grew up was for your own benefit and the benefit of the world and the environment. I will continue fighting for our planet and I hope you will join me. Our world needs it. And I know that your strong and passionate brains will make a strong impact on your future and on future generations.

<br><br>

Love,
<br><br>
Mom

To my children:
<br><br>

The year is 2060. I am now 61 years old, which seems unimaginable because it seems like just yesterday I was in college, and my mom and dad were 60. They had just gone through the uncomfortable feeling of passing that 60 year milestone, something that you don’t ever imagine you will pass when you are a kid, a feeling I am going through right now, and a feeling you will one day inevitably go through. When I was in college, roughly around your age, the biggest crisis at the moment was the climate crisis. We were destroying the world we were living in everyday. The lifestyle of most humans on the planet contributed to the environmental crisis. It was the result of about 60-100 years of carelessly polluting the air, and they did so because they weren’t seeing any immediate repercussions. This same mentality was still happening when I was in college. People were living the way they wanted, myself included, because climate change wasn’t going to suddenly vanish if they switched to a plant based diet or stopped driving their cars. As you know, I was already eating mostly white meat because of my mom and dad, but I still had burgers and steaks every once in a while. I was very hopeless for the environment when I was in college, especially when I was taking a course on the climate crisis. It seemed like it was too big of a problem for the world to tackle. In some ways it was, but the world surprised me.
<br><br>

Although it took longer than expected, we eventually elected politicians that truly cared about the climate crisis. Politicians, along with the rest of humanity, realized that it was the most important problem happening to the world at the time. By 2032, congress had passed an edited version of the Green New Deal, a plan for creating an environmentally friendly America. There were a few kinks in the plan, but with patience and creativity, they were able to make it work for the entire country. The entire world began changing for the better. One country would act on the climate crisis, and another country would follow. This chain of inspiration is how we started chipping away at the climate crisis. More people around the world began switching to vegan, freegan, or climatarian diet plans. The usage of cars stopped increasing as much, and eventually plateaued. This is still a problem we need to work on, but at least it isn’t getting worse. Flying is still a problem, because people aren’t going to stop traveling while they are alive. Science has yet to come up with an alternative solution to that. Another current problem is people’s addiction to stuff. People still have way more than they need, and it is continuing to damage the environment. We are far from done with climate change, but we made major steps in the right direction that I didn’t think were possible by the human race. We have much more to do, but at least we are making progress. I need your generation to carry on the plans and actions that mine has started. It is up to you all to help solve this problem. I want you to know, and this is something I wish I believed when I was your age, that even when something seems impossible, as long as there are people fighting for the good side there is always a little bit of hope.

<p>
A message from the future:
<br><br>

Congratulations for sticking through the changes. Knowledge is power squandered if not acted upon. Thank you for acting upon that knowledge. Switching to a plant-based diet was not easy at first, but as time progressed, it just became as easy as brushing your teeth in the morning. Minimalistic lifestyles are not considered minimalistic anymore. That's just how everyone lives now. It seems like everyone successfully banded together to defeat the enemies of the climate change movement. 
<br><br>

Remember those evil fossil fuel companies? Well, thanks to powerful scientific and business innovations and the success of anti-lobbying proposals, the U.S. Government has finally decided to officially stay away from harmful fossil fuels and those evil oil companies. Almost the entire world runs completely on renewables like solar and wind now. The CO2 levels in the atmosphere have  dropped an astonishing 20ppm since 2020 and are only continuing to drop. 
<br><br>

Thank you for continuing to advocate for these changes following Eng23. It truly was a life-changing course that completely revolutionized your way of thinking. Thanks to Professor Hiltner, billions of people from all around the world can now live in a relatively safe and healthy planet. Water rise in Bangladesh was halted before it could rise even further. Thousands of people in Florida no longer have to worry about if their houses will be washed away during the next flood season. 

<br><br>

The world is truly a better place now, and it's all thanks to the changes you and everyone else around the world made to your lifestyles. If I could have made one change, it would have been for you to start earlier, but my hindsight is 20/20 and the past is in the past. Thank you for everything. Thank you, Ken.

To my children,
<br><br>
In March of 2020, I was 19 years old during a time when many started to realize that the climate crisis which had already devastated millions of people and wildlife and was destroying much of the planet's land and ecosystems, with the threat of only more disaster to come if we did not act soon. While there were many people concerned about the climate crisis, there were also many who didn't act on these concerns and instead remained passive.  While many of us tried to stay optimistic, it was very hard to do so when powerful fossil fuel companies fund corrupt politicians to prevent the enaction of sweeping climate policies and conservative think tanks to spread misinformation about climate change. But everything changed by fall when Bernie Sanders was elected President of the United States. With Bernie, the Democrats taking back Congress, and a new class of politicians that actually worked to serve their constituents not evil corporations things could finally change. The Green New Deal spearheaded by AOC was the first step to making progress and tackling both the climate crisis and the systematic inequities many in the U.S. faced. Medicare for All made it so that no more would people be burdened with thousand dollar medical bills and no one would ever be turned away from receiving medical help just because they didn't have insurance. Everyone would be entitled to an actual livable minimum wage, people in the service sector jobs would be respected and earn a wage that actually compensates them for their work. The world of massive corporations would be over and everyone would support local businesses. People never had to be worried about unemployment because there would always be jobs available. Public/mass transit was reimagined and trains, busses, trolleys, and subways became so efficient that most people didn't want to buy cars anymore. New and better-tasting alternatives to meat and dairy were created and made affordable and accessible to people. People reevaluated the American dream, no longer did it mean owning multiple fancy cars and owning a massive house to only fit a small family of four. Rent and mortgages were made affordable and accessible, infrastructures were built to support unhoused people that way they would never worry about not having a place to sleep. The wealth gap closed and people stopped romanticizing billionaires and pressured them into redistributing their wealth. Power was given back to indigenous people who had generational expertise on how to nurture and protect the land. We weaned off fossil fuel and began to find other energy alternatives that didn't pollute our Earth. The education system was reformed with massive funds being in to support schools and teachers rather than the government pouring millions into our imperialist and fossil fuel supporting military. Around the world, boys and girls were educated the same way. Girls and women were given autonomy over their bodies. Education on the environment and climate crisis became a core part of the curriculum taught to students of all ages that would continue on in the university levels, that way no one could be misinformed about climate change. This is not to say that the climate crisis was over, in fact, it was far from it as we had wasted too much time fighting over what to do. But by 2020, we stopped and realized what we had done and what we needed to do now. It has been a long process that we are still going through but hopefully, when this all comes to an end, we can see that besides tacking the climate crisis we made the world an overall better place.

<p>
My first year of college I took a class known as English 22, “Lit and the Environment” mainly just to fill in a class and fulfill my unit requirements for Fall 2018. Flash forward to the year 2020, in which I grew excited learning that the Professor at the time Ken Hiltner would teach another class known as English 23, “The Climate Crisis.” I was so uneducated on this matter back in the day but today I am here standing here in this lecture hall recalling what the climate crisis was and how everything changed that year.
<br><br>

2020 was a very unusual year overall. I remember sitting in those same seats you guys are currently in. Many took this class to fulfill their unit requirements, but a small majority actually took it because of their interest in improving the climate’s state. We were living in a time when the poorer countries were suffering the effects of the crisis all because of our nation’s great contribution to putting emissions into the atmosphere. It was a time in which many even denied a climate crisis even existed simply due to the fact that they hadn’t witnessed these so-called effects first hand. Many to this day still ask, “what changed in this generation’s mindset? How was this crisis slowed down?”  
<br><br>

As I said 2020 was very unusual. There was one event in particular that changed the course of everything for the better. That event was the COVID-19 pandemic, a flu-like virus that wiped out thousands of people. Now I know many of you are asking yourselves how this has anything to do with the climate crisis. In fact, it greatly relates to it. This pandemic, like with the climate crisis had its deniers. It had those people who couldn’t care less about the situation all because their own community wasn’t being affected. However, once this pandemic spread many started to believe its gravity. Our earth lost a great population with this event, but there is one outtake in particular that caught my attention.
<br><br>

It was the ability of us humans to finally unite and work together to slow this pandemic down. People started listening to the authorities and limiting going out in public. It was a time when everyone helped each other out. After seeing how grave this situation was, everyone put their interests behind and worked together to find a way out of it. Eventually the cure was found. This was a turning point for the climate crisis as well.
<br><br>

We were in the midst of a grave situation regarding the planet’s condition. We had been told that if the amount of emissions wasn’t lowered soon,we could start experiencing first-hand events as soon as 2040. However, the 2020 pandemic changed everything. The fear it imposed on people caused everyone to change for the better. People’s mindsets changed; they didn’t want to live through a moment like that ever again, and they realized that if they continued to ignore scientist’s pleas to reduce their emissions, they would live through worse moments. It wasn’t the future everyone wanted for the next couple generations. 
<br><br>

The 2020s was the decade that was vital for climate change. And now we can say that the mission was accomplished. In this decade new legislation passed, a new Green New Deal was passed, the Democrats won back the house, and our nation used its great wealth, power and influence to help out other nations. Together our world worked together to slow down the climate crisis. We successfully got rid of the oil and coal industries, and made a switch to solar. People started giving up on driving when it wasn’t necessary. Many even decided to switch their diets to a plant based one. I have to admit, this couldn’t have also been done without Professor Ken educating us on this subject. His Youtube channel, “Climate Crisis 101” was a great step forward in saving our planet. Today I stand here in front of all of you recalling how our generation accomplished Ken and his whole generation’s pleas to end this crisis once and for all, instead of educating all of you on how to deal with its effects. I am truly glad that we listened and paid attention at the right moment, because time was vital in the 2020s. If we hadn’t acted on time, maybe we wouldn’t even be here together in this room right now. I’m not just recalling this victory that changed the course of this planet. I’m encouraging you to do the same; continue practicing these habits to avoid having to warn future generations of what’s coming net, like Ken and all those before did with our generation.




</p><hr>


<p>
To myself back in 2020:
<br><br>


It has been 40 years since the day you have finished the climate crisis class with Ken. At that time there are still so many people that are still not wanting to believe that what they are doing is destroying the earth. It might sound a little bit pathetic but with the effort from everyone who has the knowledge of this situation, there are more and more people who started to believe and have actions towards that. The ruth is getting revealed. 

<br><br>

I remember 2020 had been a year with so many tragic things going on, the fire, the plague of locusts, even the virus….. People are suffering a lot this year. With this situation getting worse and worse over the years, people started to realize and think about whether what they used to believe, the climate crisis was not real, is the truth.  
<br><br>
Gradually, until 2030, more and more people started to take action and became activists about the climate crisis. Celebrities are using their fame to educate their followers and made a huge change for the climate crisis. Even though sometimes, you know it was peer pressure, but the goal is to save the planet and we are making progress toward that. Not long after that, the government began to use legal means to help to provide environment- friendly transportation, food, technology, etc. and limit large-scale environmental pollution. People are given the opportunity to have more sustainable lives than they used to have. Students are getting the correct education about the environment, no one is misled. Therefore, the younger generations are putting so much effort than our generations just to live better. Education is important. 
<br><br>


Throughout the years of protecting our planet, the natural disaster has decreased and people are living a much better life than what we used to have. Nobody has questioned what we were doing, what you are doing right now. 
<br><br>
So, just keep doing what you have been taught, do not question yourself, spread the idea of the climate crisis. Believe that you are going to, everyone is going to live without working about the tragics anymore.

A Message from 2060:
<br><br>

Looking back at my life from 2020, I remember how vastly different it was, but also how little has really changed. I remember I used to drive my gasoline fueled car to and from school everyday. I remember the huge house that I grew up in with the spare rooms and constant air conditioning. I remember how I used to eat cereal with cows milk for breakfast and hamburgers for lunch. I remember how I would go shopping at the mall for new clothes every time there was a big event that I wanted to get dressed up for.
<br><br>

I remember how 2030 was a huge year. Our earth was literally falling apart. 90% of all species on the planet had died, hundreds of millions of people had been displaced and killed by floods, fires, and hurricanes, and the planet finally, once and for all, decided the enough was enough. I remember I was scared. I remember that I thought all hope as lost. The big companies across the world had pushed humanity too far-I thought. There was no redeeming ourselves. The moderate progress that had been made in the decades before was not going to be enough. Finally the level 9 Daniel Hurricane was so deadly and irreversible that every single american believed and supported climate action. We elected Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as our first female president and she led us into a new more sustainable, efficient, and happy world. 
<br><br>

Now it is 2060, and I am sixty years old. I now go to work every day instead of school, and I take the electric train instead of driving a car. I live in a modern apartment, that is not very large but is just enough room for me, my husband, and our two adopted children. My husband and I have been eating vegan for thirty years now, and my children have been vegan ever since their adoption. We love to go every weekend to check on our plot on the roof where we are growing our own food. Our house rule is that at least one part of every meal has to be homegrown. we make a game out of it. As the kids grow, we go to a couple favorite thrift shops and sift for new favorite clothing, As they outgrow their clothes we give them back. Neither my husband nor I are "workaholics" but we are always comfortable with money. Once we realized that buying things for short term happiness was unnecessary to live a sustainable and peaceful life, we have more time and money to spend with each other and are able to have more free time then we have ever thought was possible for our comfortable lifestyle.

Dear Future Me:
<br><br>

Hopefully this letter finds you in a time where humans have taken many steps to reducing and reversing the effects of the climate crisis.  After having taken climate crisis 101 with Ken Hiltner at UCSB, there are many things I have learned about the climate crisis, things which make the planet’s situation seem very bad.  There are so many aspects of my life that I see that I need to change, such as changing my lifestyle and increasing my participation in politics, in order to contribute to humanity’s effort to reverse what we have done to the planet.
<br><br>

Hopefully in the future I have been sticking to the promises I made to myself to live a life where I have a reduced carbon footprint and am taking steps to encourage others to follow in my footsteps.  This class currently has made a big impact on the way I make decisions.  I now consider the effects on the environment when I do things like choose what to eat, what to buy, and how I travel places.  I intend to continue thinking this way so that I can help create a future where humans no longer have to be concerned about how long the planet can survive.
<br><br>

Hopefully the lessons of this course have not only stuck with me, but have been passed to others either through you, or others who are interested in saving the planet.  As I have realized while taking this class, most of the world does not know about the climate crisis, so they are unconcerned about the planet’s condition.  When I started the class, I had no idea how horrible humanity has been treating the earth.  At this point this is being written, the planet has a very limited time to survive.  If I did not take this class, I would have continued living my life without concern for how my actions have been affecting the planet.  Even if someone had told me about the climate crisis, I would have acted interested, then promptly forgotten the conversation as it seemed like too much work to be concerned with the climate whenever I make a decision.  I am currently worried because everyone probably thinks the same way I did before I took the class.
<br><br>

Hopefully you live in a world where everyone has learned about the climate crisis and is making efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.  Although during my time not very many people care, and the people who do are not able to do much, I believe that in due time people will realize that the health of the planet is more important than enjoying a steak dinner or driving the most expensive car.  I also believe that as the planet’s condition worsens, more people will take notice of the climate crisis and place more pressure on politicians to put the interests of the planet over the interests of fossil fuel companies.
<br><br>

Hopefully you live on a thriving planet.  The planet that I live on is dying at a rapid pace, and at the moment not much is being done.  I do have hope though, that humans will be able to take control of their emissions and create a world that will be able to support the many generations to come.
<br><br>

Best,
<br><br>
Your past self

It was 40 years ago when I attended my first year at UCSB and took the class ENG23, "The Climate Crisis," taught by Professor Ken Hiltner. I had taken his class that he taught the quarter before, ENG22, and in that class I became interested in the problem of the climate crisis and how it was impacting the way we lived. Although I did not attend to stick with ENG23 until the end of the quarter, I ended up doing so because I realized just how important this class was going to be for me in the coming years. In this class I learned that the Earth was decaying rapidly, and if we wanted to continue living on it, we needed to bring change into the world.
 <br><br>

By the end of the quarter, the pandemic COVID-19 had begun spreading around the globe, throwing billions into distress and disorderly chaos. It seemed like getting into people's heads about how we needed to change the way we treat the environment was now going to be impossible because people were going to be too focused on how to beat the pandemic and how to properly adapt to the changes being made around the world. But, to my surprise, the general public’s extreme reactions to the pandemic, such as buying out shelves of toilet paper at Walmart, began an interesting narrative in which people started to question the validity of capitalism in America. Realizing that free healthcare needed to be institutionalized in order to protect citizens during critical times such as this one, the Democratic party began steering its votes toward electing Bernie Sanders as the Democratic presidential candidate, who later beat Trump for presidency in the same year.
 <br><br>

By the end of Sanders’s presidential run in 2028, positive environmental changes had been implemented all across America. At this point, 60% of Americans had switched over to electric cars, while 20% of Americans were now using electric bikes and bicycles, made possible through various state and federal legislation that made state roads very bicycle-friendly. It has now been my 4th year being vegan, which became the social norm after Instagram influencers began making it seem trendy to take on a plant-based diet for the sake of the planet.
<br><br>
In the year 2040, about 80% of the global population has taken on plant-based diets, and as a result, global carbon emissions have drastically reduced. The world is a much better place, specifically in America, whose general mindsets have become less materialistic, and began reflecting a mindset that values the importance of community and fellow man. American citizens now work together to preserve the Earth, rather than working against each other in order to climb to the top. 
 <br><br>

It is now 2060, and in America we live under President Grimes, who won the presidential vote in a landslide due to popularity in being one of the spearheads for positive environmental change in the world, alongside her husband Elon Musk. The meat and dairy industry is practically non-existent, due to meat production being outlawed in almost all countries, and as a whole, human society is thriving after we realized we needed to value the Earth before we value ourselves. It’s beautiful.

The year is now 2020 and there is so much promise in store. This new decade, I hope, will be a time where we take action and fight against large fossil fuel industries, the disbelievers of climate change, and the governments who refuse to make change. There is so much potential for good and better future. With the election this year, I hope that the democrats will take back the Senate, hold their power in the House, and be elected as president. If these cases occur, I think we can pass the Green New Deal and start taking action against climate change. During this decade, we should lessen our reliance on fossil fuels and find cleaner sources of energy. Budgets should be rearranged to spend more on education as this will create a more knowledgeable and aware public. People, however, should continue to live happily and responsibly. As seen at the end of 2019, people know that climate change is a serious issue and have taken action through voting, activism, or hands on projects like planting new coral gardens. Cheers to a brighter future and the roaring twenties.

The 20s were not what I expected. In the year 2020 alone we had large wildfires in Australia, a pandemic, a falling economy, and a political election with a poor outcome. We were not even six months into the new decade, when the world began to fall apart. Trump was reelected, the Green New Deal was never passed, everyone feared for their health, the economy fell into a recession, and societies went into disarray. It is no surprise than nothing was done to prevent further climate change. During the 20s more species went extinct, large amounts of sea ice melted, and many coastal areas flooded, leaving behind higher sea levels. The country was focused on the recession and didn’t have time to stress over the planet. We continued and still continue to rely on fossil fuels, meaning large corporations still run the world. My hopes for this new decade is that people begin to take a stand against the injustices of climate change and that politicians do something about it. 
 <br><br>

…

January 1, 2040 <br><br>

Changes were definitely made during the 30s. Companies began to invest in new energy sources and countries around the world took the initiative to pass legislations combating climate change. This was a good decade after the mess of the 20s. Not surprisingly, the United States hasn’t done too much to reduce emissions. My guesses are that during this decade, some changes will be made but not enough to make a massive impact. I do, however, think more and more people are coming to terms that climate change is a global issue that needs to be addressed. Politicians during the 30s did a decent job at passing climate legislation and I’m sure that will continue through the 40s. I’m just waiting for the moment when everyone hopes on board and is ready to fight for the planet. 
 <br><br>
… <br><br>


January 1, 2050 <br><br>

I think this is the year we’ve all been waiting for; the year where the earth is destroyed and we finally realize it’s time to take action. This is the decade that coral reefs were projected to be 90% gone, leaving only a remaining 10% of the world's coral alive . While we were making progress in the 30s and 40s, it never was enough to make substantial differences. But I am certain that this decade will be the change everyones been waiting for. At this point no one can deny climate change and argue that there is no need to take action; everyone has seen the damage we’re causing. People all over the world are changing their personal and cultural actions by changing their diets, transportation, and housing. The world is starting to look as it did over a century ago: smaller houses, tight knit communities, better modes of transportation, and more resourceful. 
 <br><br>

January 1, 2060
 <br><br>
Looking back through these entries, I can see it's been a crazy forty years. We have gone from a split society/government who couldn’t make any progress on climate change to now a society who agree on climate change and have taken many actions to combat it. The only thing I wonder is if we acted too late. We may never get back the species, ice, and land mass we have lost but I’m hoping we have slowed down the progression of climate change. We haven’t entirely stopped using fossil fuels, but it is no longer our primary energy source. Along with this social classes are starting to look better than they have in decades. It is no longer the case that the top 1% hold all the wealth and power. Wealth has been better distributed through all the classes and poverty rates have gone down substantially. With that, people seem to be living more sustainable and happier lives and I hope this will continue.

<p>

To my future self, in 2060:
 <br><br>
Thank you for keeping your spark alive. 2020 was not easy for you: amongst personal struggles and trying to take care of your mental health, the world felt like it was on fire. And it was on fire at the beginning of the year, when Australia burned and thousands lost their homes, and millions of innocent animals died in the nightmareiesque bush fire. After that, political tensions in the United States rose at it became time to elect a new president and completely flip the political script. All of this then paled in comparison to the Corona Virus pandemic, which shut down schools and created mass hysteria as people went into quarantine and tried to feel human through all of this. But like everything else, it passed. And while you were at home, dying to escape, you remembered why you were at school in the first place. Your degree was in Environmental Studies for a reason: you want to preserve and protect a dying planet that has done a tremendous amount for humankind. Once you returned to school as a second year, you were able to obtain your degree in Environmental Studies and finally begin to work for National Parks and State Beaches, and be out in the field and have a direct impact on the Earth that you love so much. 
 <br><br>
 
The political script was able to change as well, despite the chaos that ensued in 2020. Although Bernie Sanders would have been the best candidate to help our planet, Joe Biden was elected for the 2020-2024 presidential term. And although it took some time, the United States was able to sign back into the Paris Climate Agreement and eventually pass the Green New Deal. Some economic hardships occurred as a result of this, but we were able to completely change how the United States supplies its job, and we changed the importance of work to the average American. Numerous jobs surrounding clean energy and the divestment of fossil fuels were supplied, and with this new work came the reevaluation of our values as Americans, and we as a society were able to turn away from our consuming, materialistic ways and progress entirely. As we saved our planet, we also found a way to save ourselves. 
 <br><br>


 The decades of progress that brought us to this time of peace were most definitely not easy to achieve. Honestly, there were times when you were absolutely hopeless about the future. But progress was made one day at a time, both in your personal life and on a global scale. As you earned your degree and learned about that state of your planet, you reduced your carbon footprint immensely and encouraged the people you loved to do the same. Although they originally scoffed at the idea of not eating meat, or not driving a car, or even just buying less, they eventually understood and made those changes. The cultural shifts that were made gave you the most hope. We all thought that we were doomed, but stopping this crisis reminded you how powerful collective, personal, and political action can be, as long as we all remain brave enough to make those changes.




</p><hr>


<p>
To my children:
 <br><br>


    I want you all to remember the importance of your actions and the impact that you have the power to make on the world. The years I was growing up and going to college were vital to how society was going to react to the climate crisis we got ourselves into. For decades, we knew that we were harming the planet and yet we did nothing to stop the mistakes we were making. Corporations making money off of fossil fuels among other things that were contributing to the climate crisis and spent millions if not billions on installing doubt and encouraging the denial of climate change. We were facing doom but the people in power couldn’t care less as long as they got their money. I guess this is what we get when the people making the decisions about the future are also those that won’t be here for it. 
 <br><br>

    With the lack of effort from the majority of people in power, we saw a few politicians that really wanted to make a difference. One of my favorite politicians ever, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was elected into congress and introduced the Green New Deal. This was a bill that aimed to combat the climate crisis in a variety of ways. We needed to retrofit buildings, provide universal health care, create well-paying jobs in the clean energy sector and so on. Many people thought it was way too ambitious, but she believed that with the right support we could make it happen. I agree with her. It wasn’t that the U.S didn’t have the resources to make this happen, it’s that they weren’t being properly allocated to allow it. 
 <br><br>

    When I got to college in 2018, I started learning more and more about what the future would look like if we continued to ignore climate change. I was devastated at the fact that we have everything we need to fix this crisis and yet we did nothing. Along with most of my generation, I was growing restless. Democracy moves too slow and we started too late to effectively address such a forthcoming issue by relying on our elected officials to address it. We needed to do something. Many groups on campus like CALPIRG and the Environmental Affairs Board tried to do their part by either funding or educating people on the climate crisis and the things we can do to fight it. I got involved and my environmental studies major kept me educated on the problems and allowed me to see the possible solutions even clearer than before. Throughout my years at UCSB, there were local movements in Isla Vista, the community next to UCSB made up mostly of college students, to do things like encourage use of the community gardens, get rid of the use of styrofoam containers in local restaurants. 
 <br><br>

    When I graduated and started my own life as an adult and even when I lived in my apartment in IV, I aimed to always make my decisions with the impact I was having on the environment in mind. I avoided single use plastics, I composted as much as possible, I ate very little meat, lowered my consumption of dairy products and many other things. These personal actions I took also inspired some of my friends and family to do the same. They saw that it wasn’t super expensive or time-consuming to make these changes and decided to try it out as well. I also continued to support politicians that had similar values as me and the policies that they presented in an effort to combat climate change. 
 <br><br>

    As you know, I also pursued a career as a climate scientist. I continued to evaluate the state of the climate crisis as we made societal improvements and took action. The Green Deal didn’t pass when it was presented but many smaller, local bills took its place. Grassroots efforts took its place in an effort for people to protect the environment they lived in. I think it worked out because the laws that were put in place were essentially tailored per region. There are millions of ways to go about eliminating our carbon emissions and it's not a one-size-fits all plan. I loved the Green New Deal but I think that having these changes happen on the local level allowed the process to be sped up and allowed the people to feel more passionate about the cause. We were a fews years late in meeting our goal but the U.S had zero carbon emissions by the year 2054. 
 <br><br>

    I am glad that we finally took action to solve a problem we so long denied and remained complacent on. We have seen the detrimental effects from ignoring the climate crisis but without the activism in these past four decades it would have been way worse. Society as whole has seen significant improvements as many social issues had to be addressed to make these environmental changes. Universal health care took a long time to pass but it gained a large amount of support after many people were left with hospital bills from being treated for COVID-19 in 2020. Even some republicans supported this because they too deemed it wrong to be charged to stop the spread of a new deadly virus. We have made significant strides in changing the way we interact with nature, but there is always room for improvement. I want you all to always strive to make the world a better place. You are young, smart, and empowered young people that are capable of achieving so much. I can’t wait to see your generation grow and outdo the actions my generation has taken to protect the environment.




</p><hr>


<p>

To Me in 2020 :
  <br><br>

This is a letter from 2060, I’m glad that you can receive it in 2020. I believe that you always imagine what you future would be after 40 years, and more importantly, what the earth, our environment will change in 40 years. Is the climate change successfully alleviated in 40 years with the help of environmental activism? Does government complete their projects mentioned in the Resolution#109? How was the temperature after forty years? These might be some questions you would like to know from me, but I am not gonna tell you what’s happening right now, you need to figure it out.
  <br><br>

However, there are some truths I have to say. As what scientists have expected, in 2060, the year I am standing, the sea level has rise 28 centimeters in 2060. This has caused devastating effects on coastal habitats and other species. Some animals like birds and fish have lost parts of their habitats forever, some offshore countries are in danger. I still remember the days in Ken’s lecture when he was taking about how serious the climate crisis is, and the reality proves that he was right.
  <br><br>

Fortunately, more and more people have realized how important our environment is, and beginning protecting our planet. The number of vegetarians have increased dramatically, and most countries have adopted green and recyclable energies in daily transportation. There are rare suburbs and 99% of people have moved the cities, living in small apartments, similar to the egg apartments in Japan. People have realized how much greenhouse gases that the wasted food, transportation, house, and industry will emit, and adapt more environmentally friendly habits in daily life. As a result, there are no such people called environmental activism, because most of people are protecting the environment without any push. Almost every restaurant have updated their menus from meat-based to vegetable-based; The industry who produces a lot of pollution either shuts down or utilizes the emissions into making their products; The fossil fuels are mostly depleted, and the last gasoline car in the world will be discarded at the end of the year. Now, most cars and transportation tools are driven by electricity and hydrogen fuels, there are even some cars using the vegetable oils. The number of cars per household are restricted to one car, so does the child.
  <br><br>

As I have noted, although some bad things have happened, the environmental awareness among people are increasing. Look back to the lectures, films, readings, and videos I have watched in ENGL23, I would say that a lot of terrible predictions about the environment come true, but various of solutions towards the climate crisis are applied, as well. Some new policies like carbon tax are used in half of the countries in the world, which greatly contribute to the protection of the environment. The materialism and consumerism gradually disappears in 2060. Instead, the minimalism has become a popular lifestyles in the US. The trend in this year is environmental protection.
  <br><br>

To me in 2020, don’t be discouraged from the facts in your years. The future is not too bad, and it would be better if you take more actions as I used to take, and make all of your efforts to alleviate the climate crisis.

<p>
A message to my future self:
    <br><br>
   Over the decades we have seen the gravity of the climate crisis exponentially increase as much more data and research was released to the general public. Over time, we have had people deny its existence and/or the true severity of it. Over time, we have had trouble kickstarting the movement for Earth. But, not anymore. Now is the time for action. I can admit that I was a bit mindless over the true cause and severity of this ongoing climate crisis, but my ignorance was beginning to change and I slowly began to educate myself ever since I had stepped foot on this lovely campus. There wasn't really much that changed, except my mindset and the formation of my new ideals. It is actually pretty crazy to think that i was thinking of going to Pepperdine over UCSB. I'm glad I didn't, because this school has taught me so much. Some of my major changes came about through the enrollment of my first class of English 22 "Literature and environment". It placed me into this state of mind where it was highly evident that all the upcoming generations were terribly ignorant and inconsiderate towards our lovely home, Earth. It made me realize that there was this ongoing trend of incomprehension of what was going on and every year, it was just too late. I wanted to change that. I wanted to be aware, I wanted to help. I wanted to make a change. But, I didnt know much of what I can do, because I didnt understand the true state of our problem. 
  <br><br>

     Then I enrolled in English 23. I had been so intrigued by the prior class that I decided to take the second class to it, and I am glad I did so. I was a bit more intuitive and excited over this next class, because it was directly associated with the climate crisis and solutions and discussion of the current state of our planet. English 23, had given me the answers I had been looking for. The class had given me the solutions to a lot of my problems, and not only did it help me in my own personal quest for a change in my ways, but it helped me personally as well. I would sit there hopelessly, thinking what the fuck could I possibly do? I mean we are being bombarded by problem after problem that we face now in today's modern world, and what kind of intuition are people showing to actually change, none. But that ends today. 
  <br><br>

     Change is difficult and we all know that, but it is necessary for the salvation of our planet. Anything you could do, do it. You are now the future. You are in control. It is now 2020 and  I have ridden my bike everywhere, not driven my car, cut down on all red meat consumption to 0, I have watched the amount of water I used, the electricity I use, and so much more. I have done a lot in my life alongside many others to see true change in our world, for a better future. A better future not only for myself but for my kids... well our kids since you are me. You are the new generation that is in charge of the future. You and your pals are the new heads of corporations. You guys are the new politicians. You guys are in charge. Be the change we so wholeheartedly fought for. Be the difference. Your actions will determine whether we continue to live on this planet or not. This beautiful planet that we call home provides us with literally everything we need to advance and plant the seeds of our future. It gives us our water, our air, all the materials we have needed to become the advanced beings and civilizations we have created. Show gratitude to the very place who has nurtured you since the day you were born and given you a place to stay and be alive up until this very second. Be nice to Mother Nature, the same way she has been kind to us. Strive and work, before it's too late. English 23 has really taught me the uncertainty of our future. We have a chance, but we have to act now, or else things can go sour real quick. I have full hope and optimism for the future. Don't fail me now, because at this point in time, you won't just be failing me. You will only be failing the future and the continuation of man-kind. Please don't forget your roots, keep the cycle going, never stop changing for the better. Thank you.

<p>

When I think of UCSB, I remember sitting in my English 23 Climate Crisis class wondering how the hell we were going to save the planet when the people around me showed such disinterest in what was being taught to us. Our professor Ken would teach us different things each week about the climate crisis and different actions we can take to better our situation. However, students were disrespectful and only cared about talking to their friends during lecture until it was time to pack up and leave early, all while Ken was still teaching. But it’s because of people like Ken who were willing to admit their generation’s mistakes that allowed us to learn from them and not repeat history. And they helped us as much as they could, even though we were often rude and may not have deserved it. 
   <br><br>

Although there were people who didn’t even bat an eye towards the global chaos occuring, I will never forget those who had such passion for saving the world. The past was tough but together we were stronger. It wasn’t easy. We had to do a lot of things we said we couldn’t do. So how did we do it? Well, it first started when Bernie Sanders became President in 2020. Change sparked when we finally had a President who was prioritizing the people over profit. 
   <br><br>

One of the first things done was the implementation of the aspects of the Green New Deal. We changed our whole structure of living. We changed how we got places by upgrading public transportation, increasing bicycle use and thus decreasing car use as well. People started to commute together more frequently, and became happier and healthier by doing so. We changed our energy supply to be completely renewable which meant that thousands of people’s jobs were replaced with clean energy. This caused far less health hazards and decreased pollution, improving the air and water quality. We took time to evaluate how much work as a country needed to be done. We stopped relying on other countries to make our things for us, and stopped producing as much in general. We realized that we didn’t need all of the consumption, especially when we transitioned into a sharing economy. People would share clothes, tools, cars, equipment, food, furniture, etc. which in turn decreased our waste and forced companies to make products that were sustainable. With less things needing to be made and done we were able to let people work far less than before. This gave people more time for hobbies and their friends and families. People started to become more active so we needed to give them the space to do so. We started tearing down department stores and replacing them with parks and community centers so people could gather and be a part of their community again. People need human connection, so once we started focusing on that our mental health got better. Our mental health also got better once we gave free universal health care. People could actually go to therapy and work on their issues which caused a huge decrease in the number of suicides and people diagnosed as depression. Not only did our mental health get better, but our physical health too. Free universal health care aided in allowing our population to flourish once again. People started to take care of themselves because they didn’t have to go into debt to pay for medical bills and medication. People got the help they needed, when they needed it, and were better way before we used to see. 
  <br><br>
We as a country became smarter once we extended public education through college. This allowed everyone to go to school to get a higher education. We discovered the cure to Cancer and Alzhiemers because we didn't stop people from pursuing education anymore. And because people were being educated for longer, we saw a decrease in the population growth. 
   <br><br>

However with the good always comes the bad. It is often said that you grow through what you go through. And well, we grew a hell of a lot as a country, and as a world. Our weather got so intense that we lost millions of people’s lives due to the hurricanes, tornados, sea level rises, tsunamis, earthquakes, and fires. Places started having weather like it never had before. Tornados wiped out thousands of peoples homes all over California. Fires light up the world like it was Christmas year round. There were no more mini earthquakes. And all of this still continued to happen even after we stopped emitting CO2 into the atmosphere because of the time delay. It forced millions of climate migrants to find homes in new places, so we had to work together with other countries to adapt to these changes. Not only did people lose their homes, species lost their homes. We lost the Amazon Rainforest and the Great Coral Reefs for good. We lost thousands and thousands of species forever which drastically affected our planet. Our oceans and lands lost so much life that the whole world had to mainly eat a plant based diet. Which was good because we started to eat healthier which led to the decrease of cardiovascular diseases. With the bad can come some good. The bad times made us have to rely on each other more. We became more of a community through our troubled times. 
   <br><br>

So I think back to Ken talking to my generation about what we could do to better our future. I remember feeling upset about those who didn’t care about what he had to say and how to fix our mess. But I am thankful that I, along with so many others, still persisted and did all of the things we said we couldn’t do. In life there are going to be so many things that we can’t do that we will have to do. We simply need to start doing it now so we can actually have a future.

Dear Myself: 
   <br><br>


I still remember 2020 and how pivotal of a year it was. It was a tough time, not only for myself, but millions of others. In just the first three months of the year, it seemed like everything was falling apart around the world. The infamous novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China was wreaking havoc in countries everywhere. I remember how shocked I was when, for the first time in my life, classes had been cancelled and shifted to online lessons as the pandemic rapidly got even worse. I remember how happy I was when I voted for the very first time in a presidential race, casting my vote for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. But I also recall how disheartened I felt when he lost the Democratic nomination to Joe Biden. Although I threw all my support behind Biden, he went on to lose the general election, and Donald Trump’s second term as President of the United States began. I remembered thinking to myself about how we missed the window of opportunity to act on climate change. 

   <br><br>

The 20’s were a horrible time. While the 1920’s were immortalized as The Roaring Twenties, the 2020’s became known as The Dark Twenties. As the Trump administration continued subsidizing the agricultural industry and allowed the fossil fuel industry to run amok, the environment continued its collapse. In the early 20’s, catastrophic fires burned huge swathes of the African savanna and rainforests, dwarfing the damage done to Australia just a few years prior. As the climate refugee and immigrant crisis worsened, xenophobic and isolationist governments took power in more and more countries. It wasn’t just a bad time for the environment, but also terrible for democracy and globalism. The United Kingdom suffered economically in the aftermath of Brexit, as China continued to crack down on dissent and increased their restriction of human rights; in the United States, huge protests and demonstrations broke out in response to Trump’s second term but they were ultimately fruitless. 

   <br><br>

It wasn’t until 2028 that we finally got some glimmer of hope again. There was a heated primary election cycle in the Democratic Party that pitted Pete Buttigieg against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had stepped up as the leader of the progressive movement in America after Bernie Sanders’s retirement from politics. Despite doubts, attacks, slander, and opposition, AOC rose above it all and not only won the Democratic nomination but went on to win the general election. She became both the first female and first Hispanic President of the United States. She also was the most progressive President since FDR. I remember how she brought tears to my eyes during her inaugural speech, announcing that she would be carrying on the legacies of FDR as well as Bernie Sanders to move our nation forward. 

   <br><br>

Of course, AOC couldn’t magically fix everything even as President. She launched a meaningful Green New Deal that did a lot to try and reverse the damage done to the environment, but the problem was that a lot of it was irreversible. 2020 had been our last real chance at stopping the worst of climate change. By 2028, far too much damage had been done. But AOC’s administration took the first real steps towards healing and recovering from catastrophe. 
   <br><br>


Over the next three decades, from 2030 up to and through the 50’s, the world suffered a lot. New diseases, global famine, the results of ocean acidification, and catastrophic weather events and natural disasters became the norm. For a lot of people, it felt like we were living in a dystopian or apocalyptic world. But slowly, the world began to heal. 
   <br><br>


It wasn’t without scars. Hundreds of thousands of families, millions upon millions of people had their lives irreparably damaged and changed. But finally, in the late 50’s, things started to stabilize again. The global population had reduced in size, and some major cities of decades ago were now effectively underwater. But the efforts of progressive leaders like AOC in the late 20’s and early 30’s really began to pay off as the entire world eventually switched to Green New Deal-like policies. The evil fossil fuel industry was finally shut down, and 2059 became the year with the lowest carbon emissions and CO2 ppm in the atmosphere of the past 40 years. 

   <br><br>

Now, it’s 2060. It’s early spring now, and as I sit looking at the water, drinking coffee, I find myself with nostalgia for the old days. Maybe it’s just because I’m overlooking the UC Santa Barbara lagoon from the tables outside of Starbucks, and it reminds me of when I went to college 40 years ago at this exact location. But, I think it’s more than that. Seeing the spring flowers bloom in the distance, looking at the lush green trees and bushes on the other side of the lagoon, I have a sense of renewed hope again. Some hope that we can heal- not only our country, but our world as a whole. 
   <br><br>


Now, I can fully appreciate how important it was to not lose hope when I was younger. Even at a time when everything was falling apart, I still held on to the hope for a better future. When the world was beginning to crumble all around me and it seemed for sure that it was too late to do anything, I never gave up on the prospect of better days lying ahead, somewhere in the dark but unclear future. So, to my 2020 self, don’t lose that so-crucial sense of hope.

   <br><br>

Now, I can move forward, knowing that my hope and optimism wasn’t for naught. Forward on this path of healing, knowing the horrors of the past, I believe that our civilization will carry on and pick itself back up from the ashes. Perhaps the 60’s will come to be known as The Bright Sixties, the beginning of an era of newfound hope, resilience, and healing.

Dear Past Me,
   <br><br>

First and foremost, I want to thank you. I want to thank you for taking the Climate Crisis class taught by Professor Hiltner, for opening your eyes to all current and future damage and destruction the planet would face, for deciding on Monday, March 9th, 2020 that you would no longer allow yourself to be caught in the consumerist and ignorant system by which the nation is run. It is not solely me who thanks you, but Planet Earth, too.
   <br><br>

It took much effort and many retries to get you (me?) to live the lifestyle you do now, one that is most environmentally friendly and aware. You had to start slow, beginning with subtle dietary changes, such as avoiding the consumption of meat and out-of-season produce. Even this shift required active, daily focus to break the subconscious habit of grabbing whatever looked good to eat (but you did it!). You moved your attention next to sustainable clothing, vowing to take part in the re- and upcycling of clothes, proposing a monthly clothing switch with your friend group where you all brought clothes you were bored of to a location and swapped them to revive your closet without needing to purchase new items. Even 40 years later we still meet monthly. You then decided it was time to embark on a journey of public transportation, choosing to support new legislation for the wider spread of such means by voting and also using it as your main way to get around. Realizing how under-acknowledged the convenience of such means truly was, you began a petition to get funding for more advertisements of public transportation solely to raise awareness of and support for it. Feeling satisfied with the win of getting enough signatures for that, you moved on to planning your future circumstances, making a small, barely-livable sized home with a clothesline to dry your clothing, placed in the middle of a city and having a bicycle for transportation and just enough space in your home for a cat and a husband your life dream. With aspirations like these, unclouded by unrealistic hopes and desires for a seven-car garage full of luxury cars connected to a marble-trimmed mansion with a vibrant, green lawn lush enough for 5 kids to play safari in its forest-like blades, you were able to set your mind to and be completely satisfied with your tiny, humble abode you call Home. 
   <br><br>

Living so consciously in this small slice of heaven truly brings you the most happiness and gives you the most fulfillment out of life. You were able to take your passion for the environment and incorporate it so fully into your life that you live every day more aware and appreciative than the last. 
   <br><br>

So thank you, 
   <br><br>

Future You

<p>
In the last 40 years…   <br><br>

My generation came of age. I finished my undergrad and moved to a city, any bustling city as I had always dreamed to continue my education. There in the bustle, I enjoyed the freedoms and fulfillment of a tiny, yet cozy, living space, efficient public transport and rid my life of clutter and stuff. Simplify. Never before had I left so liberated. I took joy in sharing with my neighbors: building relationships and community over plant-based meals, swapping clothing, working together on projects like gardening. It was fun, good for my wallet, and gave me a support system of people I cared about. I chased my dream of working in international environmental policy. I knew that until I could make the impact I wanted to career-wise, living by example would make a difference by inspiring others around me to live more consciously as well. I wasn’t alone in spreading the news. We — my generation, my like-minded peers — grew in numbers. We mobilized, protested, demanded change. We fought HARD against mass consumerism, against fossil fuel interests in politics, against our nation pursuing more unsustainable energy sources like methane hydrate extraction from the sea floor. We started a cultural revolution: utilizing social media to change what we thought of as trendy, successful, desirable. 
   <br><br>
We passed the Green New Deal. It took longer than we hoped because the 2020 election may not have gone the way we needed it to. But with the right people in office and the youth of America mobilized in support of a climate revolution, the new precedent was set. From there, little victories turned into big ones. Inspirations like AOC paved the way for other women, POC, young leaders to change the face of politics. No longer was corruption, fossil fuel industry pandering and skirting responsibility accepted as the norm for government officials. With more representation came a revitalization in the way people, especially younger generations, interacted with politics.Top-down change seemed possible as grassroots efforts increased pressure for change from below. This was the step necessary for Americans to start seeing tangible change around them - on a big scale. Nation-wide infrastructure for public transportation, renewable energy, all the technology we should had been utilizing for decades finally became a reality. 
   <br><br>
Unfortunately, we didn’t act fast enough to prevent all the consequences of the terrible ways we had treated our planet. A lot of that can be traced to the battles in political offices and largely economic fears among the masses that wasted precious time. Although our society is finally headed in the right direction, embracing plentitude economics, catching up to the majority of European countries who embarrassingly outpaced us in the move to “green” years ago, the lack of system-wide changes in the U.S. until more recently has led to exactly the consequences we expected in areas of the world like Bangladesh. We still have so much work to do. We are responsible for so much of the suffering we see right now, disproportionately higher in places who did little to contribute to the crisis. I work every day in a challenging, but fulfilling and important job to mitigate these effects — to ensure cooperation between nations to address the difficult situations we face that transcends borders. We may not have been able to accept responsibility for ourselves in the past, let alone the disasters that other countries faced as the planet warmed. But now we have learned that we have to work together, unified and compassionate, to make sure we progress past and never return to the inaction we saw 40 years ago.

A message from the future:
   <br><br>


Ah 2020, what a crazy year this was. I was a junior in college at UCSB, studying Environmental Studies. Looking back now I could not be more proud of my commitment to learn about the environment and how to protect it from further climate damage. Besides my environmental courses, I also took a class called English 23. I remember I originally took it just to fulfill a GE requirement, but it turned out to be such a key class that shaped how I lived and how I viewed the future. Reflecting on 2020 I realize I made a lot of decisions that year and the years to follow that would impact my lifestyle, the planet, and our culture as a whole. That year I really reflected on how I could reduce my personal carbon footprint. I made multiple commitments to myself but the big ones were: try to walk, bike, or use public transportation whenever possible, and limit my flying, shop at environmentally conscious shops and stores, eat a mainly plant-based diet (something I had already started working on since my freshman year of college), and the biggest one was to become more politically active and communicate to others about the climate crisis whenever the opportunity presented itself. 
   <br><br>

I am so grateful that I made these choices in my early 20s and have been able to implement them into my life to this day. I am also grateful for those like me who chose to do the same. Overtime I could see a major cultural shift and people slowly began to realize the severity of the climate crisis. In addition, when democrats finally took back the white house in 2020, we began to see a change. Although it did not happen overnight, these shifts in peoples lifestyles created the demand that was needed and resulted in major political action. We saw our government and economy finally start to shift away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. On a personal level, we saw peoples diets change and how they consumed goods. Over years of work we had our transportation sector shift to make public transportation a viable and even desirable option. All of these changes were making a change. It was not always an easy battle though, we saw major backlash from many conservatives and big fossil fuel companies, but overtime we were able to find common ground and do what was best for the people. And all of these shifts created jobs for people, basic living wages, more opportunities, and a happier America. 
   <br><br>

I can't even begin to imagine what the world would be like if we did not take the necessary actions needed at the time. I'm not even sure if I would be here to explain this all to you or if you would be here to read it. It was a scary and uncertain time in the early 2020s, but thankfully personal and government action were able to combat the most severe crisis facing our generation. In my 20s I inherited a world where the generations that came before me did nothing to prevent this damage, but I am here to say that we were the generation who saw the change we needed to make and did it for you, the future generations. We wanted you to live in a world free from climate fear and anxiety, a world you could peacefully pass on to your children and all future generations to come.

A message from the future:   <br><br>

It is the year 2060 and I'm sitting at home with my children and my young grandchildren. There's a documentary of the climate crisis on and I can't help but get emotional as I watch. My grandchildren ask me why and I start explaining. I feel extremely happy and proud of my generation and those that keep coming after. It is true that we are still in the climate crisis but the progress that we have made as inhabitants of this world is just extraordinary. The first step that was taken in order to combat this crisis was to accept the green new deal and live by its guidelines. This made an enormous impact, although it took a long time for people across the country to accept it as many were skeptical of the crisis itself. However, it was ultimately accepted and served as a motivation for countries across the world to adopt policies similar to the Green New Deal. This came as a sign of hope that we could one day have a healthy environment again and eventually be out of this crisis. Something else that was implemented in order to combat the crisis was that abortions and birth control was made legal all across the country and free for all women. This was definitely a landmark decision as many conservatives were opposed to this, however it was only fair that this was made possible not only for the climate crisis, but also for women's reproductive health. This really had a big impact on population growth since women had unlimited access to these services. Personally, I taught my children how to live a life caring about our environment and gave them a lot of education on the climate crisis. I committed for my family to eat an exclusively plant-based diet 3 out of the 7 days of the week. This alone drastically reduced the greenhouse gas emissions of my household. I also decided to drive an electric car, although it is not ideal I felt like a car was absolutely necessary for my life. Although we did have a car my family and I usually biked wherever we could, which helped our climate as well as helping us stay healthy. I can now tell that raising my children like this payed off, as now I watch my children teach their children how to live a lifestyle thinking about our environment. Like I mentioned before we are definitely still in this climate crisis, however the progress that we have made is immense. We now must continue to fight for our planet and not go back to our old ways. Our climate is still not in an ideal place, however it is still recovering and will continue to recover as long as we support it. Thinking back I remember being a young adult and having many people around me thinking that we were doomed and there was absolutely no point in even trying to save our planet. However, for those that remained hopeful I am grateful, because of them we are now doing so much better and will only continue to move towards a better climate.

<p>
A message from the future:
<br><br>
I am writing to you with good news. In a time where everything seemed so bleak and negative, when people couldn't even agree with scientific evidence or even speak about it rationally, we managed to save our planet. It wasn't easy and it didn't happen quickly, but we did it.
<br><br>
It started in the 2020 election.The country rallied behind the Democrat, and Trump was ousted from office. With a new administration came new policies and priorities. Instead of disputing the climate crisis, we took necessary steps to attend to it. We started by rejoining the Paris Agreement. Funding was funneled into scientific research and renewable energy, and within a few years new advancements were made. We developed tools to help reduce the carbon  that was residing in the atmosphere, and solar/nuclear energy became so effective that every country in the world was using it within the next 20 years. Planes and cars were given necessary modifications to reduce their footprint, and travel became cleaner and easier.
<br><br>
Education about the issue took great leaps. Starting with elementary school, kids were given knowledge about what carbon emissions were doing and can be done to avoid them. The general public was stopped being fed fake news, and instead was fairly and properly educated. People realized that this was not a political issue, but rather a humanity one. Both political parties began to work together, and we made the necessary changes. The Green New Deal was finally passed, and it was a great success. The temperature increase began to slow, and polar ice caps stopped melting. 
<br><br>
Once the rest of the world saw the steps the US was taking, they rallied behind the issue as well. The leaders of the world all met together, and after much deliberation and debate, they decided to work together. New mandates on carbon emissions and business operations were instituted. The fossil fuel industries were taken on and defeated, and despite their attempts to influence government, they were rebuffed. Within a few years, the industry was nearly abolished.
<br><br>
As for myself and my generation, we made the necessary lifestyle changes to make a difference. Our diets became less meat dependent, and as the artificial meat industry made more and more improvements, people made more and more adjustments to their diet. People began to take more public transportation and travel less. They began using more FaceTime and vacationing less. House sizes were reduced as people began to realize huge mansions weren't neccesary, and more people began to move into cities. I personally made the effort to educate my children about the issue and explain what they could do to make a difference.
<br><br>
These changes were not easy to make. The first few years had a lot of pushback and debate. People struggled to give up lifestyles they had always known, and it was difficult to make everyone understand. The problem actually got worse before it got better, and it led to more natural disasters and suffering for people all around. however, after much rallying and calls to action, led largely by our generation, we achieved our goals. We proved that when we all come together for a cause, we can truly change the world. This success would lead to more world collaboration, and over time, relationships would improve.
<br><br>
I am proud of our generation and what we were able to achieve. We insured our children and grand children would have a place to live and that humanity could persist as always.

<p>
A letter to my future self:<br><br>

If you are reading this year, first of all, congratulations on surviving the coronavirus and all the nature disasters! It has become a reality, and as sea levels rise, we have lost millions of miles of coastline worldwide. But we still bring it to life in some way. Of course, stricter laws have been enacted, but these are just different laws in different places in history. An important part of getting out of this predicament is how the world comes together.
<br><br>
I hope you have learned about the climate crisis in your first year of university, and that you will recognize that your actions have an impact not only on individuals but on the world as a whole. I want you to realize that you need to change your lifestyle without having to wait for others to take action to make your decision sufficient.
<br><br>
People are becoming more aware of the topic of the climate crisis, and have decided to reduce their own emissions by reducing waste, giving priority to slow transportation, reducing purchases and possibly even moving into micro-apartments or joint residences in cities. At this point, slow travel methods will become more effective, eliminating the need to travel by plane across the continent, and bicycle infrastructure will be improved to accommodate the influx of new people cycling to school and working. At the same time, the Green New Deal was finally implemented and people began to see changes in the United States. It is now 2060. About 40 years after I wrote this article, not only did the temperature rise, but also the number of certain animals and terrestrial species. Despite these consequences, at least you know that taking action sooner or later can bring you comfort. If everyone ignores the climate crisis, things like heat death, famine and climate disasters could be even worse. The continued effective communication of the climate crisis and the drastic changes in government policies will bring a better future.
<br><br>
We must remember what we have, don't forget where we come from, and cherish the fact that we can still live on this planet at all times. The only way to keep it that way is to work hard to reduce the damage to the planet and continue to innovate to help the international community.





</p><hr>


<p>

It is the year 2060, I am at home enjoying my retirement with the love of my life. We own a small home with half an acre of land where we grow our own vegetables and raise a few chickens. Every time I work on the garden it reminds me of my freshman year in college. The name Peter Kalmus is now a name engraved in my head because of how much I despised him back then. It seemed every time we were presented with a reading or video of him I always had something to say, and my professor Ken always had my comments up on his lecture. Now I see that the life Kalmus had was not too far away for people like me. We just needed a few changes to our government. 
<br><br>


In 2020 the democrats took back the house and finally Trump was out of there. They worked hard on making the Green New Deal a policy, as soon as that happened we saw changes everywhere. First in the United States, there was a move to almost zero greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, fracking was stopped completely, there was a generational move to vegetarianism even some moving to freeganism. Soon corporations were adopting all these changes there was a move to more vegetarian/vegan restaurants that used local/organic produce. Not everyone was happy with these changes at first, some people had lost their jobs, but the Green New Deal was destined for success. Wealth was distributed more fairly, and those that lost their jobs were taken care of by granting them an unemployment salary and aiding them to find work again. Which was not at all difficult. With so much change happening workers were needed everywhere, the unemployed were quickly employed into jobs that helped the environment were wayyyy less dangerous to the workers and that loved that.

<br><br>

People from my community were also thriving, people began acknowledging the large undocumented communities that are in the United States, and instead of trying t get rid of them they offered support. We were no longer being exploited, my father was paid fairly and worked the same amount of hours as a normal U.S. citizen. Prices on rent were now fixed, no more raises of 50-100 every year. We no longer had to look for another place to live every time the rent got to a point we could not pay. Our education was getting better, we saw teachers getting paid more and going through much more training to meet the standards. Grades and attendance were getting better in our communities, there was less street violence. They even opened up adult schools for undocumented and documented parents to learn English and other skills that will help them fit into our society. Even a community garden opened up which was not there before. Where I went to learn my gardening skills at the workshops they had every Tuesday and Thursday. Then became an instructor myself teaching young and old the techniques of gardening and the importance of good nutrition. Communities were becoming more and more united. 
<br><br>


Soon after other industrialized countries took notice of the change and they adopted it as well. Everywhere there was change happening and it was all good. Now I sit outside working on my garden in good sunlight happy and at peace living the life I despised Peter Kalmus for having.

<p>

A foreseeable speech in the future:

<br><br>

[Speaking in front of UCSB student audience 35 years from now]
<br><br>

Hello everyone! I am here, not to to give an ordinary speech but rather, speak of an apology that's long over due. On the behalf of my generation, I'm sorry for not being the change we needed. In the early millennium, my generation was given an inheritance, not gold or money, but something far more valuable: Earth. We also inherited a debt from the previous generations. These dues that cannot be paid in material wealth but rather: the health of our loved ones, the hurricanes that take the homes of our neighbors, the abnormal weather  that has robbed California from its status as the golden state, the factories that pollute the water and air from our brothers and sisters in countries whom had no say, and has taken the single most valuable thing in each and everyone one of our lives--Time. Because of the mistakes of the past, your time here and the time of your kids and their kids on our paradise, will be shortened. My generation may have inherited this debt, but the worst part is we knew how to fix it.
<br><br>


What were the solutions back then, you may ask? When i tell you, some of you and possibly all of you, will grow to hate my generation because... well to be quite frank... they are nothing compared to what your generation has must do. (I then show them Ken's video of the 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet) (Audience is predictably upset). Yup, that was it. All we had to do was: eat plant based food and eat the right vegetables during the times of the year, use contraception and not have to many babies, educate everyone no matter their gender which should be a given, minimize car usage and ride a bike--i know you all don't have this issue with your fully electric 0 emotions automobiles--, live mindfully and don't live in what my old professor would call a "MC Mansion", keep and repair our old stuff--recycling today has become so efficient, wish we had this back then--, stop using airplanes and use other better means of traveling--you definitely don't have this issue with those new trains that can travel over water--, vote for "good" candidates and propositions--heard Bernie's clone is doing quite well this year--, buy from companies with environmentally safe and social practices--can you believe that in my time, companies would risk the lives of their workers to make clothes and other stuff for pennies because "it would help their economies in the long run"? Thought we got rid of slavery in 1865--, protest and gather/create groups of activist to enact change--Once again, I'm sorry we couldn't do this--, take power away from enemies of the environment--if only we could of done this back then and banned people like the Koch brothers from the planet--, hone our skills and implement solutions that we can share with everyone--can you believe, sharing today was not much better than it was in my time? With the exception of hologram Face time---, remind our selves of why its important to be the change--for you, and the people who come after--, and most importantly, BEING THE CHANGE.
<br><br>


I can see that many of you are upset and with good cause. Some of you have lost families to flood, famine, and new category 10 hurricanes that are capable of destroying a city in mere seconds. Or some of you may be upset the pollutants from these previously existing corporations has cause chronic illnesses that a will forever be passed down from generation to generation . Either way, I apologize for not stopping those large evil companies with only self interest in mind, and from not stopping these dangerous new weather phenomenon we are calling "Anthropogenic World Disasters" from manifesting. My generation, no, I have failed. This issue was as much as my generation's as an individual one. I could have tried harder! I could of fixed these problems! I could have saved your families! I could have been the change! ... But I couldn't do it.  So you may be asking once again, what is this old fart up here ranting about? I want you.. no... we want you , each and one of you, to become the hero's that we could not. Hold on to the planet, what you have left of it, and be the wake that may become the miracle to save this planet. It may not have been me or you, or your children, or their children, but I believe in my people--human kind--and that they will one day bring our mother Gaia to good health from the cancers that resulted from human history. My generation couldn't pass the baton properly; in fact some say that we dropped it in a deep trench, yet, the Human race is not over. At this point, it's more accurate to say: become the miracle we all need.

A letter to my future self: <br><br>

I’m writing this on March 15th, 2020. I’m a freshman in college and have just started studying for my major here at UCSB: Environmental Studies. So far I’ve learned a lot. I’ve taken two intro to environmental studies courses and am currently taking this class called the Climate Crisis (ENGL 23). I’ve become aware of the various consequences that the climate crisis has caused and will continue to cause. This year has already been a disaster. The Australian wildfires impacted so many animals and destroyed so many habitats. More than 1 billion animals died because of the fires and it was out of control. The videos and pictures broke my heart. Global warming intensified these fires and 2019 was Australia’s hottest year so far. Climate change has also intensified so much more natural disasters, such as the hurricanes in Florida last year. This is all so scary and has led me to continue to fight for change. 
<br><br>


I am trying my hardest to lower my carbon footprint. I have tried my hardest to eliminate beef in my diet and try to eat less meat in general. I am hopefully going fully vegetarian soon and then the goal is to go vegan. However, in this class, I’ve learned that there are other terms such as climitarian and freeganism, which means you try to eat a diet according to what is least harmful to the environment. I love these terms and hope they catch on by the time you're reading this. It’s very important to let people know that there are various other options and labels other than vegan and vegetarian. This can maybe inspire us all to choose one of these lifestyles to save our planet.

In this class, I watched a documentary, “Before the Flood”, which alarmed me immensely. I learned that if we don't act now the arctic ice caps will be fully gone by 2050. Along with the ice caps, the coral reef needs help. It’s been one our dreams to get to witness this beautiful ecosystem and I hope we get to experience it. Ocean acidification is causing these reefs great damage and we must stop emitting so much CO2 into the atmosphere. With elections coming up I hope policies can be placed to do so. I really hope this isn't the reality now and hope we prevented this awful thing from happening. I hope we’ve prevented many disasters from occurring. Altering our planet is one of the worst things that we as a generation could ever do.
<br><br>

 I promise I will try my hardest to do everything in my power to save this wonderful earth for your future children and future citizens. I hope you learn so much more about the environment and how to save it in these next four years. I hope your passion for this subject stays or grows even stronger the more you go on. I know I’m hoping for a lot but hope is the most important thing we could have during this crisis. No matter what, don’t lose this hope. Keep your optimism and high spirit, we got this.

I was once too young to understand the significance of “Earth Day”. I was too young to understand the importance of that little “reduce, reuse, recycle” song that we were taught in the 3rd grade. I was too young to understand what people meant when they said that if they could wish one thing upon us all, it would be world peace. 
 <br><br>

I grew up a little and learned that not everyone is nice. Not everyone is looking out for you and your best interests, and not everyone is conscientious toward how their actions affect those around them. I started learning about how everything we throw away doesn’t just disappear; instead, it is dumped onto our precious lands and oceans. I started understanding the importance of recycling the resources that we are so lucky to have. I started learning about the struggles and discrimination and inequality that people face every single day. 
 <br><br>

I grew up some more and I realized, the world is actually pretty f**ked up. Not only are people ignorant toward how their choices affect others, but some people actually WANT to hurt others. Some people make selfish choices despite knowing how they will hurt someone else. Some people even have preconceived negative feelings toward others simply because of the way they look, the people they interact with, the lives that they lead. 
 <br><br>

I struggled through high school, fighting hard enough that I made it to a great university. After moving 15 times prior to entering university, I was excited to finally settle down and find a place that I could truly call home. I quickly settled in and could confidently call Santa Barbara and UCSB my new home, and I missed it every second that I was away. I took a wonderful class in my winter quarter of freshman year called “Climate Crisis 101”, and I learned about exactly what the climate crisis is, how it was affecting us, how it would continue to worsen if we continued living the way we did, and how we could implement solutions to help mitigate the crisis instead. 
 <br><br>

I started implementing solutions to my daily lifestyle right away, though at first, I could not do much more than eat a “climatarian” diet and vote and spread awareness to those around me. I started driving as little as possible, I flew rarely, and I stopped giving money toward selfish fast-fashion companies. As winter quarter began to wrap up, there was a new problem on our hands: the coronavirus. During dead week, chancellor Yang announced that classes would be transitioning to remote instruction for the rest of winter quarter and for the start of spring quarter. Finals started being cancelled or switched to remote means of administration. A few days after the initial decision, we were informed that all of spring quarter would be moved to remote instruction, and we were urged to move out of the residence halls. 2020 became the year that the world felt like it was falling apart. 
 <br><br>

But, 2020 was also the year I finally got to exercise my right to vote, and I was one of the votes that elected the president that changed our future, the person who finally got Donald Trump out of office and was working hard toward fighting climate change. I eventually shifted to a vegetarian diet. I composted all my food waste, and I grew my own vegetables at my co-housing community. I adopted a minimalistic lifestyle: buying fewer items, thrifting and creating my own clothing, and taking care of the things I owned so that they could last as long as possible. Eventually, the coronavirus pandemic calmed down, and we were able to return to living without constant fear. 
 <br><br>

By 2025, the Green New Deal was amended and eventually signed into law. I had fully shifted to a vegan diet, and I was happy to see that those around me had made similar lifestyle changes. I finally started seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and I started to feel our nation’s support toward combatting this crisis. 
 <br><br>

By 2040, we had GREATLY reduced our carbon emissions, thanks to the changes brought about by proper education on the crisis as well as our commemoration of the Green New Deal. We started to see changes in weather patterns and declines in inequality. People started to live happier, healthier, and more fulfilling lives--and not only in wealthy democratic countries. Further solution implementations are being discussed, such as an increase in carbon taxes. And this time, these solutions are actually likely to be put into place. 
 <br><br>

It is now 2060, and our carbon emissions are lower than they have ever been. People have ditched cars entirely, and public transportation has been upgraded so greatly that people wonder why we ever used such pollutive forms of transportation in the first place. People are far happier than they were in 2020, and even than they were in 2040. My generation fought for the changes that helped save our planet. We acted upon the knowledge that we were given; we took a problem that our previous generations began, and we fixed it. Without our actions, I would not be writing these words today.
 <br><br>

Let this be a lesson for the future: knowledge unacted upon is knowledge squandered, and if you ever allow the planet to reach the state that it did back in the 20’s, don’t come and say we didn’t warn you.

Dear me ( from the past ),

 <br><br>

I am writing this in the year 2040, we’re 60 years old now! I live in Sweden with my wife, our two children, our cat, and our neighbor’s ferret who visits from time to time. Life is sweet, but before I get into that, I want to break down everything that will begin to happen for you from this point on. It will be quite a rollercoaster, but you’ll get through it.
 <br><br>

2020 continues to be extremely exhausting. COVID-19 will be scarier than you imagined it to be. Not only will it affect people health-wise, but it will cause grocery stores to fall short on food, and other stores to fall short on necessities as people begin to panic immensely. Stores will begin to place restrictions on what people can take out, which will be a good thing for families who are in need, such as ours. The pandemic will create extreme divide between people and the government throughout the year, one that we have never seen before. Even the narrow-minded will come to the realization that shit is hitting the fan and the government lacks preparation for its people. Healthcare and living costs will be heavily in talks from beginning to end. 
 <br><br>

As the decade continues, the level of cases from the virus decrease, and the divide between people and government continue. We begin to take a closer look at the Green New Deal as it covers not only a change for the sake of the climate, but a change for the people as well. The president of the U.S. decides that it will begin to be implemented mid-decade. By the end of the decade, you will see an advance in technological innovation and renewables as well as more job opportunities. Healthcare becoming free is a slow work in progress.
 <br><br>

With the Green New Deal being implemented, 2030 will be a year of habit change for many individuals, including us. Even with carbon taxes forcing change, many Americans find it hard to give up certain habits. I decide that moving to Sweden is the healthiest option for me as I will be surrounded by people who have already developed fossil fuel free habits. That is where we meet our wife and she helps us practice living a new lifestyle little by little. We have a garden where we grow our own vegetables, and, believe it or not, I’m vegan :). Back in America, things are looking up as Gen Z is now old enough to be heavily involved in politics. The Green New Deal is a success, and, while things aren’t absolutely perfect, people are a lot happier. I decided to just stay in Sweden and keep dual-citizenship. From 2030 and forward, America will become very close to operating like Sweden, prompting me to move back home in California. Oh yeah! Cost of living has also gotten much better. A lot of people are happier and the air is nice. California isn’t super dry and the rain comes at reasonable time (sounds crazy I know). You’re going to love it though.
 <br><br>

2060 has just begun, and I can’t give too many details yet, but I will say that, when we look at the people and the climate crisis specifically, things are a lot better than they were in 2020. The fam and I ended up moving back to Sweden because we missed it so much. America is still more progressive, but they still have much to work on. The newer generations are a lot more healthy and minimalistic than I’ve ever seen. That reminds me, we live in a very nice cottage. It’s the perfect size! My wife and I knit and sew most of our clothes and blankets, and when we aren’t doing that, we go to yard-sales. Also, I know you’re probably afraid of how you’re going to be vegan, but it’ll be a lot easier once you start. Don’t worry. Plus, many countries will end up switching to completely plant-based meat, including America. 
 <br><br>

Well, that’s all I have to say for now. Remember to wash your hands and stay positive for now I guess :)
 <br><br>

Sincerely,
 <br><br>

You in 40 years

A message from my future self: <br><br>
 
2020 was a very eye-opening and frightening time for you.  Many things you learned over the climate crisis gave you little hope for the future of the planet.  You were once frightened that things would continue as they were, with people being wasteful and not caring about their carbon footprint.  You were not optimistic about the future.  
 <br><br>
40 years ago you had very little hope that the majority of people would collectively come together to make great efforts to solve the climate crisis.  The people who held office did not make you feel like they were working countlessly to solve the issue.  2020 was a very scary time for you.  40 years ago you had little hope that the climate crisis would be prioritized and personal interest would be set aside.  40 years ago you were wrong.  
 <br><br>
It is 2060, and I am glad I have lived thus far.  40 years ago I had very little hope in humanity.  I am very pleased to have been wrong in not having faith that we would come together for the good of the planet.  2020 was a very stressful time.  Many people were not caring about the climate crisis enough to want to help resolve the issue.  With Trump holding office, the climate crisis was not being prioritized.  
 <br><br>
As a student who was attending a university at the time, many issues were circling the campus.  The Coronavirus affected many campuses in the United States and throughout the world.  All UCs were closed for a time.  The severity of the issue sparked an interest in the students to push for a cleaner environment.  When Bernie Sanders was elected President of the United States, this further pushed people to reconsider their priorities and wasteful everyday habits.  
 <br><br>
The Green New Deal became a priority for everyone to understand and become educated on the issue.  People progressively began to live a more plant-based life. As communities came together we built a happier, cleaner, and more sustainable way of life.

To: The Future <br><br>

Date: 03/15/2020 - Not to be opened until 2060
 <br><br>


It’s been about 40 years since you last saw this message, and I have to first ask, what worked out? What didn’t? And are you happy? Based on what’s going on at the moment, I could see your answers being very heavily impacted.
 <br><br>
The moment I’ve taken to write this is quite an interesting one, and in my eyes, could serve as either a major or minor turning point in history, but first let me catch you up. Currently I’m sitting in my dorm room, at my desk writing to you, in the future. The oddest set of events have occurred, leading to my upcoming move out, rather than vacating the dorms only for Spring Break. The rise of the COVID-19 pandemic has required school to move online, counties and cities to cancel large events for the foreseeable future and the practice of self-quarantining to rise. As the world at large is working to find a cure, to no surprise are political and economic pursuits slowing down research. While this may come at no surprise, a lot social/political and economic agendas have in part largely worsened our current abilities.
 <br><br>
In writing this to you, it’s important to note the actions of human beings through to the present. Environmentally, we have grown more and more disastrous as the practices of our daily lives destroy the planet past repair. The largest contributions to this destruction have included livestock and family planning.
 <br><br>
From March 2020 and onward, I feel optimistic in some regard, but also thinking realistically about what can be accomplished.
 <br><br>
The spread of COVID-19 I feel will really shape both our policy and social approaches to various ideas. In regard to policy, as we are facing a global health pandemic, the passing of a solution bill bi-partisanlly, illustrates in my eyes that yes cooperation is still possible. If this were true, I would hope to see some implementation of progressive and sweeping changes in regard to environmental policy, illustrating that while indeed inheriting a problem, we were able to fix it. I would hope in taking a class such as “Climate Crisis,” and the initiative we as a generation appear to have, that we focus our energies to achieve true change. I feel realistically though the passing of any environmental policy (for example the GND) now will begin slow, and that comes with things such as normalizing carbon taxes. Likely many tacked on additions may limit these bills initially, but it’s up to my generation to actively push for what we want, and simply what needs to be done. In regard to social ideas, the popularized ‘consumerist’ lifestyle we practice has come and gone, finally learning that items do not fulfill us. Also, that xenophobia is really and practiced by many (as recently seen with the pandemic), and that we as a country CAN and should be learning from others. So prevalent in ‘western’ thought is that our practices are ‘better’ than others, which always isn’t simply the case. In regard to our social and political practices, it is my hope that people take seriously the need to rely on others, and ask for help, even at a national scale. Only through changing practices in our own lives (i.e. the mass population) will businesses react to these wishes. In having enrolled in this class my first winter quarter of college, I hope that my generation continues to reduce their carbon footprint, both within their daily lives, as well as push to be politically active and vocal. My final wishes would be that while a sad reality, someone in the future is able to receive a letter, as in my hope, a result of progress toward achieving full sustainability.
 <br><br>
I hope this finds you well.

Hey son/daughter, 
 <br><br>

It's your mom. I hope you're settling into college life and enjoying the beginnings of this new stage. I miss you already!! Freshman year is incredibly exciting and overwhelming and you're going to make some great memories. Now that you've moved out, I've been thinking about my freshman year, which was a million years ago. It was 2020 and TikTok was all the rage. But, a bunch of really important things happened also. 
 <br><br>

In my second quarter, I took a class about the Climate Crisis and it opened my eyes to the incredible damage that we, as humans, were doing to the earth. I know you've read about the early 2000s in your history and science textbooks, but I think it's important that I tell you about how it felt to be a young person during that time. In 2020, things were really starting to ramp up -- we were less than a year away from the next presidential election, the Green New Deal was a resolution in Congress and the effects of climate change were being felt everywhere. It was scary; some people were making changes to their lives, but fossil fuel companies were still extremely powerful and the Green New Deal wasn't an actual piece of legislation yet. I had been vegetarian for a year and a half at that point and I made other efforts to waste less, but personal action wasn't making much head way. 
 <br><br>

And, let me tell you, it got way worse before it got better. Despite the momentum and support behind Bernie Sanders (the Democratic nominee), it wasn't enough. Trump was reelected and, in his second term, further restricted the influence of the EPA and other environmental groups. We saw more fires in California, more hurricanes and floods in the south, and the east coast (where Gramma and Grandpa are) was being covered in feet of snow. When I graduated in 2023, the future seemed bleak. We were less than 30 years from 2050 and we were quickly approaching the point of no return. But, thankfully, as the 2024 election approached changes were starting to happen. It was slow, but it was happening. The Democrats finally took the Senate and the Democratic presidential nominee (my college roommate!!!!), Ashley Alvarado, won in a landslide. She was the first female president and everyone was really excited! Her and her VP, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, got the Green New Deal passed and it seemed like the US was finally heading in the right direction. I know you're really close with your Aunt Ashley, so if you want to pick her brain about her presidency, she'd be happy to tell you everything (she doesn't like it when other people try to explain her policies). 
 <br><br>

Things were really getting done. Every government building was switched to solar power and half the oil rigs in the country were closed and the land was restored. Ashley even instituted a program to get rid of 75% of the industrial agriculture industry and replace it with far more ethical and environmentally safe practices. I don't know if you saw that NY Times article I sent you, but that goal was just met last year!  
 <br><br>

In her eight years, a huge amount of progress was made. And while not everything was fixed, 2050 came and went and the world was still very healthy. That's why it's important for your generation to keep up the work that mine started! That's what your grandparents always said to me and now I am saying it to you :). 
 <br><br>

Anyway, you know how much I love to ramble (even in an email). I know you think it's weird that we have chickens and fruit and vegetable patches in the yard, but those are just a few of my quirks that help us keep the planet healthy. I love you so much! Stay healthy and make sure to not waste any food -- especially now that UCSB has a fully plant based menu! 
 <br><br>

Don't forget to write to me! I know you're all grown up or whatever, but I'm still your mom!

Love, <br><br>

Mom

To my future self: <br><br>

Today is March 15th, 2020. I write this as we sit amid a global pandemic that has shut down schools across the country while creating panic and uncertainty. Our global focus has shifted to containing and overcoming the spread of the corona virus. The problem is far from being solved, but with it we have noticed countries power to mobilize resources and create solutions that will help in this time of crisis. If and when we are able to move on from the virus, after it has ran its course and done the damage that we could not prevent, we need to see this type of mobilization applied to the impending climate crisis we continue to live through. If we continue to fail to make changes to reduce our impact and save the planet, then we might not be able to read this in 40 years if we are lucky enough to still be around. We have the potential to turn things around, but are failing to do so.
 <br><br>
The Green New Deal looks to be promising or at least a step in the right direction, but it seems unlikely we will see it become implemented. 2020 was supposed to be the year Trump finally left office, but his re-election is seeming like more and more of a possibility by the day. While Bernie Sanders has the support of a seeming majority of the younger generations, he currently struggles to gain traction with older generations and suffers from a lack of voter turnout among his young supporters. Biden's older supporters meanwhile are showing up and voting. If this continues then it will be Biden, who appears very unstable, as the frontrunner to take Trump's spot which seems highly unlikely. 
 <br><br>
This places an increased responsibility on the general population to lead an effort to slash our emissions to the bone and combat the insufficient political action. If we can unite around the issue of the climate since it is indeed humanity's problem, then we will be able to create the change ourselves by forcing the issue. As a population we will have to adapt to less destructive diets, better habits, and progressive new methods of transportation and energy that will be necessary to cut down our emissions.



</p><hr>


<p>
Dear 2020 me:
 <br><br>

I know that your sophomore year of college was a very hard time, both on an individual level and on a global level. With the world seemingly shutting down in mid-March and classes being cancelled, it truly seemed that your world was ending, but that was not the case. Spring quarter, which you had thought would be only depressing and lonely, actually turned out to be an extremely important period of growth for you. You had time to reflect on yourself, your habits, and what's really important in life.
 <br><br>

After taking English 23, you were sure that, if the apocalypse ever came, it would be caused by climate change. Now, however, with the world going into a panic, you're not so sure what to think anymore. Rest assured, once the world recovers from this, they start to reevaluate the path they've been following. Our government begins to think more critically about the lives and livelihood of its people, and our people realize that complacency and denying facts is not going to get us anywhere and will only harm us. They begin to take action again greenhouse gas emissions to create a more sustainable society.
 <br><br>

Your spring quarter marks a turning point in your life. Whether at home or in Santa Barbara, you begin to think of how you can better both yourself and the world. You finally go vegan (which I know you've been trying to do for a while ever since you went vegetarian in the fall) and you begin to focus more on the food you eat, focusing on unprocessed foods to benefit both yourself and the planet. Though not really an option this quarter, you begin to plan ways that you can get involved in volunteering in your next two years at UCSB, helping the campus gardening programs and finding a soup kitchen or homeless shelter that you can help out in. While still keeping in touch with your friends who went back home, you begin to learn to rely on yourself again. Spring quarter is a catalyst that launches you into the next stage of your life.
 <br><br>

You begin to inspire others to take action to stop climate change. By educating your family and friends and encouraging them to become active community members, vote, and make personal changes in their life, you help others to combat this problem. At the same time, those who've been denying the situation slowly start to realize just how serious it is, and the people demand serious climate action which the government actually responds to.
 <br><br>

You finally get your cabin with the sod roof, a true Thoreauvian dream, but its's not alone in the woods. It's part of a larger community that, like a large campsite, like Pilgrim Pines, is very community-based and environmentally concerned, gardening an hiking together during the day and eating and singing together at night. You live in the cabin with your husband and kids, an extremely loving family with progressive values and an extensive network of friends. You're still in touch with your close college friends and see them often.
 <br><br>

You work to create more environmentally friendly art supplies, as art is a very important human activity and is very important to you in particular, but crafting can often be very wasteful in terms of supplies and packaging. Because you didn't want to be creating more waste, you helped to create a sustainable, natural, and high quality brand of art supplies that help artists like yourself to reduce any negative impact on the planet.
 <br><br>

You're happy, healthy, and inspired, and the world is a better place.
 <br><br>

Lots of love,
 <br><br>

Future you

A message from the future:

 <br><br>

40 years ago, I took an English 23 class titled “The Climate Crisis.” It seemed like an interesting subject during course registrations, but I mainly signed up for it for GE credits. It was in that class that I realized the enormity of the issue that faced our planet and the actions that we needed to take immediately. 2020 was my first year in college at UCSB, and at the time I thought I was doing my part: biking and bussing to class, eliminating red meat from my diet, trying to buy things only when necessary, and voting in elections. Although these were steps in the right direction, there was more I, and the rest of us, needed to do.

 <br><br>

Later in college I joined on-campus organizations advocating for a greener world. We helped spread our messages to our friends, family, and the community. More people began to believe in climate change, but saw no urgency. Efforts were slow in the beginning, and not enough was being done to combat the crisis. On a national level, the Green New Deal was struck down for being too big, too soon, too unrealistic. Globally, other countries tried to limit global temperature rise and stick to international agreements but our world was already beginning to feel the hard impacts of the climate crisis.
 <br><br>


It wasn’t until the consequences became more severe and more frequent that people started to worry. Here in California, the fires burned longer and angrier, displacing thousands and destroying millions of acres of land. Coasts flooded and even more residents lost their homes to the rising sea level. Damages were felt elsewhere in the world as well, with many smaller pacific islands being lost, category 6 hurricanes becoming the norm, and droughts causing millions of forced migrations.
 <br><br>


But then, the future we learned was possible from our English 23 class slowly began to come to light. Politicians went back to the Green New Deal, this time further developed and ready to be put into action. The fracking industry was eliminated, and instead we opened millions of new jobs in the renewable energy sector. Cities received funding for greener living with smaller living spaces, gardens, and community networks. The government allocated more money towards more efficient buses and safer bike paths, and we eventually lost our desire for cars. Becoming climatarian became popular, so much so that the beef industry widely shut down. Around the world, young girls were provided with quality education and women gained access to family planning. PV solar panels could be seen installed on almost every rooftop. Our generation spearheaded a far-reaching movement against the fast fashion industry, choosing thrifting and ethical brands that we kept in our closets for years instead of months. At each election I saw more and more of my peers researching candidates and voting for our planet. 

 <br><br>

On a personal level, I eventually converted to a climatarian diet and learned to eat locally and seasonally. After college, I moved to a city and walked to my job every day. I shopped for local produce and my farmers markets and gradually adopted slow travel instead of flying in order to visit my family still living on the east coast. Over the years this transition became easier to do, as the average work week for Americans fell below 40 hours (giving me more free time) and new technology made working remotely easier than ever. 

 <br><br>

The journey to get to 2060 was not the perfectly ideal one dreamt up in our lecture, but we as humans worked together to make it a reality. Although we were pushed to seemingly the last minute, everyday citizens and politicians joined together to make this life possible. We stopped being comfortable with our apathy and complacency, and instead got to work.




</p><hr>


<p>

To whomever may be reading this in the year 2020,  <br><br>

This is my future self, and I am writing from the year 2060, 40 years into the future.
 <br><br>

 It’s been a long fight and struggle against every aspect that was destroying our planet via climate change. It took a lot of work, so much time, and so many people bonding together in an effort to save our planet. Every major contributor to all of those climate issues were fought back against with vigor and power, and it was certainly worth it as it led to a better tomorrow, which is today for myself. 
 <br><br>

We started by fighting against all fossil fuel corporations that were one of the top contributors to emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It took a lot of time and effort, but we were able to turn both the house and senate blue, which led to an enacted carbon tax that eventually led to the innovation of more sustainable energy. 
 <br><br>

We spread the knowledge of  excess consumerism and the damage that is being enacted on the climate from the mass production and consumption of unnecessary things. We showed the world the terrible conditions of third-world factories and enough people decided that others’ suffering was not worth another shirt or another pair of shoes that were only going to be worn once. 
 <br><br>

We also spread the knowledge that our greed and consumerism will hurt third world nations that had nothing to do with the climate crisis to begin with, yet they will be the ones that suffer the most. 
 <br><br>

We took political action with other countries in the Paris Agreement and decided as a world that climate change was an issue that was going to affect everybody. Despite what the White House may think now, it is not too late to get somebody in the White House that will make a significant difference in helping the climate crisis issue become a much smaller issue over time. 
 <br><br>

So many steps, so much time, but I can say that all of that action was most certainly worth it. I can live my life knowing that my children, my grandchildren, and my future generation to come will live on a planet that loves us because we loved it back. We no longer have to worry about our planet’s climate crisis, and you won;t either if you take as many steps as possible to fight against that issue that is the climate crisis.

<p>

A message from the future: 
 <br><br>


As I reflect on my life now in 2060, there is a lot that I am grateful for. First off, I am grateful to have been on the right side of history. I was part of the climate crisis movement and one of the people who spread awareness and did what I could to help counteract the damage the generations before me had caused. It was not easy, not in the slightest. 2020 stands out as a year that was particularly difficult and yet very rewarding. In 2020, I took my first ever climate courses at UC Santa Barbara. They opened my eyes to the severity of the climate crisis and showed me that I had to kick into high gear when it came to a lifestyle shift. This was not easy, as I had to relearn everything I was taught growing up. How to eat, shop, get around, and exist. Everything had to change. At the time, the sacrifices were so tough. But thank goodness we made them. Had we not, I’m not sure I would be able to tell this story. 2020 was the year I went vegan! Well, mostly. It took me awhile to go completely vegan, but 2020 was the year I went largely plant based and really really began to pay attention to what I put into my body, how it got to my table, and the effect that it had on the Earth. I think that by the year 2020, we were all very dissociated. We didn't ever stop and think about how the cute top at TJ Maxx meant awful working conditions in Bangladesh or how our chicken nuggets meant cruelty to animals and environmental degradation. 2020 was a year of selfishness, and then, a year of realization. On a personal level and a governmental level. As more people began to realize their impact on the Earth, change quickly shot up to the highest levels. With a new Democratic president in office and control over the Senate and House, the Green New Deal was promptly passed! This was the beginning of a Green Government, one like the one you know now, which works with the planet and the people to ensure longevity and health of our environment. A government run by people who make our future a priority and invest in us, not in big business and the oil industry. Oh right! I forgot you're too young to remember the oil industry! Let me explain. In 2020, the world was being run by large corporations with green blinders on and I don't mean green in an environmental way, unfortunately. They were absolutely destroying our planet for their own financial gain and taking us all down with them. 2020 was the year that they were finally defeated. The new administration said no to fossil fuel money and ran the White House without any donations from big business. They no longer allowed people like the Kock and Cook brothers to run the country. We finally had an administration that was thinking clearly enough to turn down temporary wealth and “progress” and focus on creating a future in which all could thrive and be healthy, and we haven't looked back since. I am so proud to be writing this in 2060 as I live in a clean, sustainable Earth. At 58 years old, I am still able to ride my bike around, play with my grandkids, and enjoy nature because of the sacrifices that I made when I was 18. Im proud to tell my family that I was on the right side of history, and in 2020, I fought for the world we all enjoy today.

A message to the future:
 <br><br>


I was born in the year 2000. I suppose you are very frustrated about the situation you are in right now as you find yourself constantly surrounded by clusters of people with little space to yourself. It used to be different in my days when the earth was only about 71% ocean and we had plenty of land to reside on. For you, however, the earth is probably left with little land as the ice sheets have melted and engulfed much of the land left. 
 <br><br>


In the year 2020, I was attending University of California, Santa Barbara as a sophomore and took English 23, a climate crisis class. In this class, Professor Hiltner warned us about the unavoidable and bleak future if no changes were made regarding the day to day habits of carbon emissions. Although my generation was made very well aware of the consequences of the climate crisis, only a smaller portion of us cared or cared enough to make changes to our daily lives, while others continued to live the outdated American dream. Back in my days, there were multiple social media platforms, such as youtube and Instagram, that started off as innocent ways to share one’s life and make entertaining content but quickly turned into mass marketing ploys for companies to sell their products and online influencers to get rich through sponsorships. With mass marketing and advertising penetrating our society, the prospect of  minimalism or even conscience consumption was almost impossible for most people. However, although the act of minimalism was unpopular and not practiced by most people, the topic of conservation and fighting against the climate crisis was. Hence, in 2020, The Green New Deal passed and Bernie Sanders was finally elected as president. I thought it would all be good news from then on, but I was wrong. Although Sanders promised a climate plan, the plan was not met within his years in office, due to COVID-19. In 2020, a coronavirus called the COVID-19 shut down the entire world for two entire years, sending global economy into a deep recession. With Sanders’ climate plan costing trillions of dollars to implement, it seemed to the public that the US had more imminent threats and dilemmas than the climate crisis. 
 <br><br>


I am now 60 years old. I have been watching the world around me either burn down or get flushed away for the past 20 years. Needless to say, any changes made against climate change in 2060 is far too late. We had missed our chances to change humanity’s future on Earth. However, a few days ago, my daughter told me about the fourth Mars mission that took place. Maybe our future generation will learn from our mistakes and start anew on another planet. Hopefully this time, you will not screw up as bad as my generations and those before mine did.

Dear Future Self: 
 <br><br>


It is now the year 2060. It has been 40 years since I was first really introduced to the climate crisis. In 2020 I took a class at UCSB called the Climate Crisis 101 that changed my life. Before taking this class, I had not realized the repercussions of many of my actions on the environment. The connections that I suddenly made between my actions and the environmental effects were incredibly alarming to me. For example,  I had never connected the issues of deforestation and all of the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere with my consumption of meat. I was horrified to learn about all the severe floods, wildfires, and natural disasters that destroyed homes and took lives because of our negative daily actions. After taking this class there were many things that I personally decided I must change in my life. I decided to cut way down on my consumption of completely unnecessary goods, meat, food waste, and to make sure that I vote for people that put environmental issues ahead of corporate interests. 
 <br><br>

2020 was a year for a chance at great change in environmental issues in the political sphere. Bernie Sanders was elected president and we started to see some change in the mitigation of the climate crisis. Though change didn’t occur immediately, it was significantly better than before. Slowly but surely, a carbon tax was introduced, a ban on fracking was implemented, and the general public started to become more aware of the issues of the climate crisis. Another significant event during this time was the spread of the coronavirus. Even though the coronavirus was a terrible thing, one positive thing that resulted was that during this time greenhouse gas emissions went down significantly in many countries. In March 2020, only a couple of months after the virus started spreading, China was already reporting a 25% reduction in carbon emissions. While the virus was not a good thing, this reduction in carbon emissions gave hope to activists that change would be possible as experts reported a possible halt in the world’s emissions growth. 
 <br><br>

Now 40 years later, I am so happy and proud of all the changes that we have made. I have fully implemented and consistently kept with all the changes I had vowed to make in my life when I was 19 years old. It was great to see that as the issues of the climate crisis became more well known and alarming to the general public, people had begun to vote for candidates that had the environment in mind above all else. Before I had taken this class 40 years ago, I would never have imagined becoming a minimalist and leading a climatarian lifestyle, but here we are now. Though I had some doubts about whether we would be able to make any significant changes that would bring us to where we are today, I am so proud of all the youth and people that have fought to spread the climate crisis issues and implement the changes that we have today. I hope we can keep up this momentum and continue to mitigate the climate crisis!



</p><hr>


<p>

When you say 2060, it sounds like a lifetime from now.  I have only been on the planet for 21 years and that is 40 years from now. It seems so distant. And yet I will still have a decent amount of my life ahead of me and my kids will likely have most of their lives ahead of them. Once I thought about this, the 2050 projections seem far more terrifying than they have been in the past. 
 <br><br>
This class in itself has already inspired me to cut my meat intake down, and I hope i am able to inspire others to do so as well. The projection of the current election primaries is a little disheartening, as many of my friends who claim to be environmentalists are not voting accordingly, and expect things to resolve themselves.
 <br><br>
I hope that the world learns to take this issue as seriously as coronavirus. While i agree that this is an issue that should absolutely be taken seriously, I also believe that it is being taken seriously because it disproportionately affects people over the age of 50. If we were able to get this support from the same crown over climate change, I think the issue could resolve otself within a decade, but we have a long way to go before we get there.

<p>
2020 was the year I took UCSB’s English 23 course, “Climate Crisis 101” because I was interested in diving deeper into the once-controversial topic that was climate change. Subsequently, 2020 was the year people decided it was time to make a drastic change in how we lived and how we wanted to see the future. I attribute this intense desire to change the way we lived to climate activists like Greta Thunberg, a fiery 17-year-old who was able to force world leaders to focus on climate change, and also unfortunately to COVID- 19. COVID- 19 led the world into mass hysteria as well as a complete standstill of how to overcome a pandemic that grew immensely overnight. One could see this as the effects climate change could have if it had the ability to change overnight. For the first time, people were able to actually imagine what the world would be like if everything was collapsing, today a pandemic, eventually the climate crisis. 2020 was the year people became mindful of their effects on the planet as well as future generations that would be our children and grandchildren. 2020 was the year I changed my choices: to buy less, educate others on climate change, and do my part to vote for politicians who support environmental policies. 2020 was the year we came together not only in the United States but the whole world to fight climate change. We were able to pass the Green New Deal and rejoin the Paris Agreement. We were able to implement a carbon tax to rid the world of most fossil fuel companies that tried so desperately to prevent the world from seeing what they were truly doing: killing the planet. As years go on, the millennial generation and Gen Z have continued to elect people who constantly fought for climate change and never looked back. I can’t even imagine what the world would have looked like if we weren’t faced with this rude wake-up call to change. Although the early ’20s weren’t as “roaring” as we all thought they would be, it was the year we decided to make a change. It was the year we said we wouldn’t let future generations face the fear of climate change. It was the year we turned everything around. And I am so thankful we did.

To my future self:

 <br><br>

The year is 2020. So far it's been a rough year. We've been in the midst of the climate crisis, an outbreak of a pandemic, and the final weeks of my senior year in college.  I am just wrapping up my class about climate change. We learned a lot about the causes of climate change, possible solutions to create a greener future, and ways to promote sustainable lifestyles to friends and family members.
 <br><br>
Taking this class has made me more informed and ready to take on the future. At first, I was really concerned about what the future holds given the short amount of time we have to make effective changes. I hope you and the rest of the world are doing okay. 
 <br><br>
To help save our planet, I started by making small changes. I began to rely on public transportation to get from place to place. I also started making more vegetarian meals and have been the reducing the amount of red meat in my meals. Additionally, I have been more aware of my shopping habits. After taking this course for almost 10 weeks, I now tend to feel that shopping is unnecessary unless its for necessities such as groceries or toiletries. I hope to learn how to sew and make my own clothing to reduce the impact of the clothing industry during this time. 
 <br><br>
I am afraid that making personal changes right now is not enough. We need immediate action from communities, politicians, scientists, and everyday individuals. I hope the future is filled with united communities, sustainable innovations, and love and compassion for one another. I know that we can get to a sustainable future, but we cannot do it without helping one another. I hope that people in the future are completely aware of their own privileges and roles in society. I also hope that everyone takes their part in creating sustainable changes and doing their part to inform one another about different ways to save our planet. When you're reading this, I imagine that the simple changes we are making right now are all part of the norm, and politicians are completely ready to support environmental legislation. I am hopeful for what the future holds. I know it will take a long way to get there, but I think through community efforts and political action, we will achieve a world of sustainability.

<p>
A message from the future: 
 <br><br>

2020 started out as a rough year. You learned a lot about how your actions and the actions of others were further driving the climate crisis forward into a seemingly hopeless place. You learned about the injustice of the climate crisis and how the United States and other highly developed nations were destroying the earth and letting the less developed countries suffer the greatest blows. Australia is on fire and you know that the $7 that you donated at a charity concert to "save the koalas" is not exactly making a difference (your heart's in the right place, though). Coronavirus is forcing you and all of your friends to pack up and go home to continue the year online. You just read an article comparing how the word dealt with coronavirus at first to how the world has been dealing with the climate crisis for YEARS-- "Alarming levels of inaction". It is only the beginning of the year and yet somehow, it feels as though the year is completely ruined and you can see no light at the end of the tunnel.
 <br><br>

You see coronavirus being compared to the 1918 flu and it reminds you of another article that mentioned this: "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells. It seems like coronavirus has turned the world upside down, but it is only the beginning. Prehistoric plagues trapped in the melting ice have wreaked havoc on the world and viruses mutate with the changing climate. All tying back to the same issue-- "alarming levels of inaction". We did not do enough, even when we not only knew what was causing the climate crisis but we also knew exactly what we needed to do to stop it. Things are not great in this version of the future; we did not start acting until much too late, and we are suffering the consequences. Entire islands are gone, extinction rates are at all time high, cities are being destroyed. In this scenario, the Green New Deal was continually put on the back burner. After all, there are always more pressing issues in the world than climate change, right? That is what the government believed and that is what brought us to this point.
 <br><br>

I'm here to tell you that there is hope. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, but you and the rest of the population have to create that light. It's 2020, an election year; keep voting and be mindful of the environment in every choice you make. Doing the research and knowing your facts will pay off, and 2020 CAN be the first step to many years of change. However, 2020 MUST be the year that these changes happen. 2021 will already be too late. Right now is the time to start making daily changes and to get involved in changes on a greater scale. Right now is the time to not be embarrassed to spread your knowledge to others and make others want to change their ways as well. Right now is the time to change the definition of success and the "American Dream" because vast consumerism needs to be left in the past before it consumes the future.




</p><hr>


<p>
To my future self,
 <br><br>

Hey there, I hope that by the time you read this our world is a very different place. I hope that by the time you read this we've enacted the Green New Deal. Not only have we dramatically decreased our fossil fuel emissions, but we've also changed what we value as a culture. We've chosen to become minimalists, to eat plant based,  to create community with our neighbors, and to become vessels of love to the planet and the people living on it. But most importantly, I hope that you are happy. I hope that you are content with the choices that you made. That you didn't just stay idle with the knowledge that you possessed, but rather, you used it to better the world. I hope that you never stopped learning and that you always continued deepening your involvement with reversing climate change. I hope that you lived your life modeling an environmentally friendly lifestyle. That you biked when people said just drive. That you sailed when people said just fly. And that you stayed optimistic when others said there wasn't a point.  I hope that you continued spreading positivity and that you chose to look at the environmental crisis as an opportunity for unity rather than a hopeless catastrophe. I hope that  you lovingly spoke up for what you believed in and that you always remembered that you were living for a cause so much greater than you. That you used your passion for mindfulness and yoga to encourage others to care for the environment and that you stayed patient at people who didn't understand where you were coming from. I hope that the bright eyed 19 year old who's writing this letter grew into a bright eyed 60 year old who can happily say that she modeled her life based on compassion and love.
 <br><br>
I hope I can be proud of you. 

 <br><br>
Sincerely,
 <br><br>
your younger self

A message from the future: 
 <br><br>

We are looking back 40 years to the year 2020. I was 19 years old, about to be 20, taking a class about what we had called the climate crisis. It went through many names: the greenhouse effect, global warming, climate change, climate crisis. Climate change still exists but it’s no longer a crisis. I’d like to think we have a handle on it enough that it won’t become a crisis again. 
 <br><br>

Things were looking pretty grim within the first few months of 2020. My generation seemed determined that it would be a good year; that we would make it a good year. By the end of March, we knew that we had our work cut out for us. 
 <br><br>

There was an election coming up. I voted in my first primary and it would be the first presidential election I was able to vote in. I was excited. I felt like I had a say in what would happen in my country. But that’s not exactly what happened. 
 <br><br>

There was a passion lit by the injustices occurring in the U.S. at the time. President Trump was causing a regression in society, enabling bigotry and ignorance. My generation was ready to take him down in this election. We had a good list of Democratic candidates that aligned with our beliefs, but we knew who we wanted. Bernie Sanders wanted what we wanted: universal health care, elimination of student debt, the Green New Deal, and so much more. Even with the support of my generation, things were not looking great.
 <br><br>

Then the coronavirus broke out and it spread fast. Nearly 60% of the U.S. got sick from it and the whole country, along with many others, went on a sort of lock down for a few months. People quarantined themselves in their houses and didn’t know what to do other than wait it out. The pandemic exposed a lot of the things wrong with the system in place in the U.S. back then, making more people realize how important universal health care was. 
 <br><br>

After it blew over, people were even more determined to fix things in the U.S. People rallied together and we voted the most qualified person into office. From there, the Green New Deal was set in place, along with other restrictions against the use of fossil fuels, food waste, and excessive use of cars and airplanes. Plant-rich diets were encouraged and people received the education they needed to understand this new way of sustainable living. 
 <br><br>

We were given our rights we deserve. “We the People” actually means what it’s supposed to mean now. Discrimination levels plummeted and equal opportunities were presented to all. We drink clean water and breathe clean air. The infrastructure in the U.S. was reconfigured so that more people had jobs, were able to work less, had more time to spend with their families, friends, and doing the things they enjoy. All student debt was dropped and tuition levels fell. We’re still working on making college free for the new generations, but we’ll get there someday. We also got the universal healthcare we had the rights to. This helped with the new pandemic we had in 2045. Compared to 2020, we have better relations with the countries around the world. The U.S. hasn’t been involved in a war in decades. 
 <br><br>

Our biggest feat of all has been what we’ve done for the environment. We followed the examples of other countries with low carbon emissions and set an example for others who still needed an extra push. We stopped the global temperature from rising over 1.5 degrees Celsius. The coral reefs recovered and animals and plants stopped going extinct within the last decade. 
 <br><br>

There is still a lot of work to be done, but we’re still following our plan that was set in 2020. Everything we have accomplished in the past 40 years was done with hard work, activism, and taking our lives into our own hands. With this same method, we’ll keep living our happier lives on our healing planet, knowing that we have the power to decide what happens in our country and we are not willing to give that power up again.

My Reflection for English 23 and Hopes for the Future:

 <br><br>

To begin with, during the fall quarter of my college life, English 22 introduced me to the field of the climate crisis. To be honest, I chose this class to be a GE class so I am not that serious about it. But as time passed, my interest and passion towards the topic and this class grew more and more. And it is also in this class I learned that global warming is just a branch in the bigger picture of Climate Change. Realizing how urgent our current situation is, I decided to take English 23 in the winter quarter, and I was awarded more knowledge. Professor Ken’s lecture was very informative, yet easy to follow. We did not only discuss the basics but also learned HOW we can spread the word and begin to make changes individually. Thanks to Ken’s inspirations, I realized there are many ways to make changes in our daily life that would help reduce personal carbon footprints, such as diet and transportation. I also learned that we need to spread the word in local communities and encourage people around us to work on the same thing. Although I am not yet a vegan nor a vegetarian, I am working my best to consume less meat and dairy products, I also take buses to campus and everywhere I want to go. 
 <br><br>


When the issue was first mentioned in 2001 by scientists, none of us expected climate change to be the possible six extinction on Earth, therefore, most of us ignored the warning signs and continued what we were doing in the past decades, our government continue to burn fossil fuel, fracking, depleting forests, pollution the air and ocean. It’s in the years of 2010, we see the nightmares come true: catastrophic wildfires and hurricanes that took many people live and destroyed thousands of homes, the continuation of ocean acidification, mass extinction of species, and abnormal climate changes. This made me wonder, how would things be different if we had listened to scientists and taken action earlier? But that won’t do any goods, because the past is in the past. What we should do now is to face the fact, accept the fact, and begin to act differently according to the situation.
 <br><br>


2020, might become the most significant year in my generation, it is in the year of 2020, as a species, we finally realize how serious the issue of climate change has become, and the first time we made important changes (politically and socially) that would, in theory, reduce the consequences climate change might bring to the future. I truly hope that we kept our promises and reached our goal of zero carbon emission in the next 10 years. We don’t have much time now, and radical change should take place, like what it’s stated in the film “A Message From the Future With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”, “The first big step was just closing our eyes and imagining it. We can be whatever we have the courage to see.”

A message from the present to the future: <br><br>

Upon completing my English 23 course, the climate crisis, I have learned about the consequences of fossil fuels, and if you are facing those consequences that means that we have failed to make sacrifices for our planet. Coming into this course I was aware of the problem, and had some idea of how I was personally contributing to it. However, I had no knowledge on how I could possibly help and do my part. In the weeks to come after week 1 I learned about how I could help and reduce my personal emissions, as well as effectively communicate this knowledge to others. From the way we dress, to the way we eat, to the way that we get from place to place all have severe environmental consequences that I had overlooked before I had taken this course. My generation was consumed with the idea of having the trendiest clothes, and since it was such an expensive thing to keep up with fast fashion companies rose to power at the cost of lives and release of large amounts of carbon emissions. After this class I committed to not shopping at brands like Forever21 and H&M despite how great their sales were in an effort to reduce my personal emissions. Hopefully in the future, we all come to the realization that we don't need a ton of clothes to make us content and we all stop shopping at these brands that are releasing tons of carbon emissions and creating a great deal of waste. While I was already vegetarian before this class, I decided to try to go vegan a few days a week. Just switching over to a plant based diet can reduce your emissions by so much, because of the methane that is released by cows. In 2020 it is common that one household has multiple cars. One for each driving member, and before I moved here that was the case for me as well, but as I started to learn more of how driving from place to place can greatly increase your emissions I decided to start using public transportation to get to places that were further than walking distance. The only thing that is worse than driving from place to place is being a regular flyer. Planes are the fastest way to release the most amount of emissions, and while most of the population has not ever been on a plane, the 2% that is released is a result of the frequent fliers that use flying to get from place to place. Learning about the severe effects of planes made me rethink my mode of transportation to the destinations that I one day hope to visit. If you are facing the consequences of severe natural disasters in the years to come, it means that we failed to make these sacrifices and did not reduce our personal emissions. We failed to educate others on these facts the way that this course taught me and pushed me to reduce my emissions. I can only hope that others will begin to understand this problem and do my part in all of this to prevent these consequences from taking place in the fast approaching future.

Dear Sir or Madam in 2020: <br><br>

This is the future me writing from the year 2060. The message in this letter is quite significant, and I hope you can read it with patience because you are the only hope for human beings and this world.
  <br><br>

It is February 14th, 2060, and I am now sitting in my house writing this letter, with only a T-shirt on. The world has been warmer, and it does not stop yet. The traditional four seasons (spring, summer, fall, and winter) have been renamed, while now we usually call them ‘warm, hot, and extremely hot’. We cannot use air conditions regularly. Since it will put more GHG into the atmosphere, the governments have put some limits on the use of many kinds of technology. When you grab a map, it is totally different from that in 2020. The continents have shrunk significantly, due to the serious sea level rise. To be straightforward, it is all over. In this letter, or memoir, I will describe our history (your present) and show you how human beings lead themselves to destruction step by step, and I beg you can take any possible chances to prevent this from happening.
  <br><br>

Since 2019, more and more people became aware of the climate crisis. However, it was far from enough. We did not successfully win in the vote, which means that the climate crisis still did not become a national-level priority, let alone a world-class problem. To mitigate the climate crisis, any possible efforts should be done, from individual to government. Although many people have confessed to the fact of global warming, they are almost unwilling to take action. When asked why they are reluctant to act, many believe that global warming will not have a particularly serious impact in these decades. Others believe that there are many other crises in the current situation. Although the climate crisis is also an issue, it has to be postponed by comparison. As a result, people have spent several years in this way, acknowledging the existence of the climate crisis, and making excuses for their inaction. 
  <br><br>

Since industrialization, a series of industries represented by fossil fuels have made great contributions to global warming, and they have accumulated rich capital for decades. When people realize that the problem may be starting, these companies spend a lot of money to confuse people and try to deny the fact of global warming. Besides, the distortion of the concept of the "American Dream" has created an unhealthy concept of consumption in the United States. After 9/11, President Bush stated that in order to fight terrorism, people need to buy more to promote economic development. Soon, American consumerism was further distorted and gradually spread to the world. By contrast, people's actions to mitigate the climate crisis appear relatively not enough. We always try to get more, but few people think about how long we can last like this, and few people think for the people in future generations.
 <br><br>
As the temperature gradually increased, finally in 2035, a disaster occurred. Initially, the melting speed of glaciers at both poles suddenly increased rapidly. As a result, sea levels have risen significantly, and even more frightening is that methane from glaciers has entered the atmosphere and the rate of temperature rise has further increased. Frozen ancient bacteria are spreading, killing many people, and governments in various countries have spent a lot of time on these unknown diseases. Also, due to rising sea levels, some coastal areas were flooded with seawater, and people in those areas had to migrate to high altitudes. This has led to some violence and war, and the world order has been shaken. At this time, scientists around the world and heads of governments have to treat global warming as the highest priority. However, the final results announced are desperate: people may have missed their last hopes of mitigating the climate crisis, and the situation is now almost irreversible. And what was the last chance to mitigate the climate crisis? It turned out to be 2020.
  <br><br>

Therefore, I beg you, while you still have hope, please act now, and it must be a large-scale and efficient operation. I have experienced this devastating future, and you must not repeat the same mistakes. It is not scientific and technological innovation that can save the world, but human behavior. There are only two buttons in front of you, one is green and the other is red. I pressed the red button and told you it was the wrong decision. I hope you can make the right choice.
  <br><br>

Sincerely,
  <br><br>

Future Me

I am here, at 19 having just journeyed onto the university hiatus. 
 <br><br>
Winter quarter I was choosing classes and was told by many of my close friends here that they would be taking a climate crisis class..."what?!" I thought, "that's exists?" indeed it did and I went onto rate my professor immediately to find high reviews about the class and Ken. Many people saying this was an unforgettable class, one that was inspiring, one that lifted a veil from those who chose to embark on the journey, find new information. The class did not disappoint, in fact it exceeded expectation. I came into this class very clueless, I honestly had heard the words "global warming" and "fast fashion" and "meat industry" but had no idea how they were connected or the damage they were doing to our earth. I quickly realized I was one of few in the class to be so naive, however I believe that most people in the US have about the dame amount of knowledge that I did. 
 <br><br>
The deeper we went into the subject matters, the articles, and documentaries, the more shaken and awakened I became. This crisis wasn't something made up from the future, it was right in front of us. I often left the Santa Cruz theater with tears after watching the documentary's, it became something I thought about in empty moments. I could not believe the destruction we have caused and will continue too. Ironically with the coronavirus going on -yeah this will probably be in history books by now - we are watching the world and all its structure and organization fall apart, and this is exactly what will continue to happen as the disasters continue, the crisis worsens. Not only will more diseases have come up Im sure, but the coastal regions will be destroyed, California will have wildfires every other week, and the gap between the rich and the poor will become so large that the world will only be sustainable for the top 1% who can pay they're way to safety. That is if our generation hasn't done anything to stop it. 
 <br><br>
It's really hard for me to think about 40 years from now realistically, I believe there will be a point where a line is crossed and a major disaster happens and the world wakes up. But I hope we can get to it before then. I have learned through this class that this starts with individual action until it become a collective one. I personally have set out to eat as a climatarian - excluding beef and all meat from my diet except the occasional piece of chicken my mom makes when Im home. I have also stopped buying into fast faction which I was once a huge supporter of, and additionally I have committed to giving uppitiest my car for the next 4 years here. I also took care to vote - for my first time - for more climate friendly politicians. I hope by the time I am reading this in 40 years I have progressed in my climate friendly lifestyle. I hope I am raising my children with the beliefs to nature the earth I bring them into, and raise them in a way that is healthy for the environment - normal size house, as few cars as possible, connecting to their inner selves and the nature around them, focusing on in centric fulfillment rather than eccentric fulfillment through capitalism.
 <br><br>
I hope within these next two terms Bernie Sanders is our president and completely reforms our social infrastructures from the ground up, benefitting the rich and poor equally, giving healthcare to all, trading with appropriate markets and companies, stops funding the fossil fuel industry, and follows the green new deal. I hope we're living in a new economy with the new jobs the green new deal provides.
 <br><br>
If there is any wake up call it's now!!!!! Sometimes things have to fall apart for them to fall back together in the right way. This is our chance to act, we have the freedom to restabilize in any way we decide. And as Ken has repeated to us multiple times, knowledge is only power if acted upon, if not acted upon it is squandered. It is crazy to see that this is one of the first panic epidemics we are bound to go through. I am so grateful I took this class and found the knowledge and inspiration I needed to make the environments well being a part of my moral code. I believe in the group of people Im with, we just need the world to get on board, one person at a time. I believe anything is possible. "Be the change you want to see in the world".

A message from the future:

 <br><br>

To my past self, <br><br>

I am writing to you from the year 2060, forty years after you took the class English 23 during winter quarter, better known as the Climate Crisis 101. Taking that class was what was necessary to push you and many others into action. Taking that class taught you how to best communicate the information that was provided to you in order to bring more awareness to your family and to your community. After taking this class, you joined the sunrise movement and got more involved with community organization in Isla Vista to bring more sustainable products and produce to the community. After you graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, you sought to do more work to bring awareness to your community about the environmental crisis. You started off by making the information that was provided to you more accessible to your family, many of them who only speak Spanish. You talked to them about the dangers of consuming meat, something that was a staple part of their diet. 
 <br><br>
After you communicated this information to your family, you found ways to engage your community in being more conscious of their consumerism. You also started the first community garden in your city, bringing people together and taking away from purchasing produce that was shipped from out of state. After introducing a community garden to the community, you sought to make biking safer in your city. The bike paths that were in place in many roads were dangerous because there was not enough space for a biker to continue moving without slightly ending up biking on the actual roads. Immediately, bike paths needed to be expanded so bikers would have enough space to freely move. Afterwards, barriers were put in place so that bikers would not have to fear being hit by cars. In larger and wider roads, parked cars were used as barriers for bikers just like they had been used in Copenhagen. Public transportation policies such as those that had been put in place in Bogota, Colombia were implemented. Priority for bus lanes meant that there was more traffic with the use of cars. High speed rails were also implemented across the country, making the need for airplane travel within the United States no longer necessary. 
 <br><br>
The United States, after much protesting, implemented the Green New Deal. People spoke up in favor of stricter implementations of the Green New Deal in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Switching to renewable energy was actually a priority for the United States after it elected a president that actually believed in climate change and was willing to make the necessary changes. Solar panels were made mandatory on every household and the federal government paid for these implementations. By making the United States be completely free from the reliance on oil, coal, and other fossil fuels, the US was able to lower carbon emissions on each household. Carbon limits were set in place for each individual because continuing to allow people to live a consumer lifestyle was what was destroying the planet. People had a carbon limit of 2 tons per year and were offered incentives to use even less carbon. With these and other heavy regulations that were put in place, the United States was able to lower its greenhouse gas emissions. What you need to take from all of this is that action NEEDS to be taken now, not later. And, individual action needs to come first in order for national and international action to follow.

To my children.
  <br><br>
I don’t know where to begin, as so much has happened over the past 40 years that I can’t fit it all into one letter. When I was young, I began learning about climate change as an issue that was solvable. They told us all we had to do was change our lightbulbs and take shorter showers. Sadly, this was a gross underestimation of what needed to be done. As you know, the current state of our planet is grim. Most of the coastal regions that existed when I was your age are now completely underwater, natural disasters are a daily occurrence, food is running out, our oceans are poisoned. None of us expected that any of this would happen. I always thought that somebody would solve it. I took a course in college about the climate crisis, and this is when I realized how screwed we were. I realized that nobody was doing very much to solve this issue, and we had dug ourselves into a hole that was almost impossible to get out of. I was shocked that there were people who didn’t believe that climate change was real. I wonder what those people are thinking now. I had so many friends who didn’t care about the issue, and now regret not doing anything. People never really care until its too late, and it seemed like none of the world cared when it mattered. It's funny that I'm now the one apologizing to my children, as before it was my parents and their generation that was apologizing to me. My professor for the class I took in college gave us a list of 20 things we could do to fight against climate change. None of them were difficult, and I tried my best to implement them into my life and to encourage others to do the same. A few people I know became vegan, but most people stopped doing these things after a few weeks because their daily life got in the way. There would be small things that happened that would give me hope, but soon after that would fade away and it would go back to normal. The Green New deal took a long time to pass, but when it did it was a huge victory. Sadly, it was taken away less than a decade later and things returned to their initial state. A lot was done in the state of California. We completely switched over to clean energy in 2040 and had the highest percentage of electric vehicles in the whole country. There was also a huge spike in the number of vegans in 2030, as it became a lot more popular. It didn’t seem to be enough though because most people were still eating meat and cattle production was still very high. The saddest thing for me was watching so many different animals go extinct. Even as a wildlife conservationist, I never knew how bad it was going to get. When I was in college, species were dying out fairly fast, but by 2050 we were losing animals that we never thought we would. Sadly, you will never see a dolphin or an elephant except for in pictures. I worked my hardest to keep these animals alive but it just wasn’t enough. The hardest for me was when my hometown went underwater. We were always told as children that this would happen, but we never expected it to happen so fast. The flooding became worse and worse until we had to move away. My high school and the house I grew up in are gone forever. It's so sad you will never be able to see cities like Miami that were so full of life when I was younger, and are now underwater. I wonder how hopeful you are of the future. I was hopeful, but it didn’t turn out the way that I thought it would. I thought our species would be smart enough to stop it while we still could, but I was wrong. Now it's up to your generation to solve this, but honestly, I don’t know if it's too late or not. Things are probably going to get even worse from here unless we do something about it right now. That's the same thing I was saying 40 years ago, and nobody was listening. Now that its too late people actually might listen, but I don’t know how much can be done. Most people were more concerned with what the Kardashians were wearing every day than they were about the future of our planet. It took the near extinction of our species for people to get their priorities straight. I just wish me and the generations before I listened to scientists and those who understood what was going on. Now, all that money that those people were protected by denying climate change means nothing. Money means nothing when there's no Earth to spend it on. With all this being said, there have been some people that have made big steps for the environment since I was a kid, and I am very thankful for those people. I think the big change is just around the corner. I hope that you can be smarter than we were, and be proactive instead of static. This is a cheesy way to end this letter, but I hope it leaves you with something to think about, its always important to remember to be the change you want to see in the world, even if the world is slowly going underwater.



</p><hr>


<p>
In 2020, I was 18 years old and going on 19. I was a student at University of California, Santa Barbara. My winter quarter, one of my classes for my general education informed me on the topic that I will be discussing to you all today: the climate crisis.
  <br><br>

UCSB is known for having the greatest turnout of voting university students and I definitely wanted to contribute to that. I voted for the first time for the democratic primaries. At that point, it was a major race between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. My vote went for Sanders. He was the most consistent with his views in his entire lifetime, being an activist and protesting for what he believed in even in his younger years. Joe Biden has a history of going back and forth and his views did not align with mine. Though Sanders and his platform can definitely be considered more radical and would require more changes, it cared more of the people and had them in mind. He cared about healthcare (proposed Medicare-for-All) and the environment (stood for the elimination of fracking) more than Biden. 
  <br><br>

My vote mattered. Bernie Sanders won California, a significant achievement. But he lost Texas to Biden, the second best. Twitter, which was once booming with #FeelTheBern (his 2016 slogan) and “Not Me. Us” was soon pushed aside and the Biden supporters revealed themselves. This demographic was certainly older and more in-between democrats. Sanders and his team expected the youth and minorities to overpower them, and from his popularity on social media, I even expected so. But this did not happen. Framed as a socialist, he was booted out of the running. This is where he gave up running for presidency. He remained an activist and continued serving as senator until he passed.
  <br><br>

Biden and Trump went head-to-head and it was a dark time. Fracking was still supported. Abortion had regulations. Healthcare was limited. Section 1325 was upheld. Based on these policies, who do you think won? It’s difficult to differentiate, isn’t it?
  <br><br>

Regardless, this isn’t a time that I am quite a fan of. This took place around my first year during the notorious coronavirus panic. It caused school to go online for my first spring quarter, cutting my winter quarter off quickly as well.
  <br><br>

People still looked at the climate crisis as some sort of hoax or something not of major concern. Maybe something to care about, but not yet. Individuals argued among each other. Why fund millions of dollars on our earth and not our people, such as the starving, homeless, or struggling?
  <br><br>

What they failed to acknowledge is that combating the climate crisis does aid these demographics. Environmental injustice is a thing, the disproportionate exposure of communities of color and the poor to pollution and poor conditions. Climate change made it harder for those without shelter. The weather would be beaming hot or unnecessarily wild. They could not afford refuge, water, or the necessary clothing. As a result, the homeless started breaking into motels which the news reported as havoc, a riot, madness. They dehumanized their human needs.
  <br><br>

The natural disasters made it worse. 
  <br><br>

If they were not invading hotels, they were dying from heat… only if the lack of food didn’t get to them first. Because of the increasing temperature change, staple crops declined in production. Moreover, with this increase of global warming came the lack of precipitation. The world was dry; we were in a worse drought than before. Water parks were slowly shutting down, not from losing business or interest, but because the supply of water was so low and could not be wasted. Hotel pools were empty, leaving an awkward gaping hole. Consequently, the cost of produce and water skyrocketed. 2032 was the year with the largest figure of homeless persons deaths.
  <br><br>

Remember the epidemic of COVID-19? As I said, it shut schools down and caused mass panic, leaving stores empty. With the lack of serious climate change action, even more diseases arose, new and old, from the interaction of ecosystems that would not before.
  <br><br>

From the great expense for food, water, and now medicine -- how could it get worse? How about the rise in ocean temperature causing hurricanes and tsunamis in severity and places never seen before? Earthquakes? Wildfires?
  <br><br>

The United States faced the most devastation. Among this doubt rose a democratic candidate who used this fear and economic insecurity to build their platform. The EU actually initiated a Green New Deal before the U.S. and though they were not reaching the level of success that they expected by this time, they were still leading the movement and made great changes.
  <br><br>

Voters were more lenient and willing to vote for a candidate that wanted to make investments to mitigate the climate crisis. They were first disappointed by the first course of action -- a carbon tax. People were infuriated! In a time of economic insecurity, why would they be taxed MORE? Their commute to work was an absolute necessary aspect of their life to them. It is what provided them with income to support their families and even then, common folk had to lose. People exclaimed why couldn’t the rich be targeted?
  <br><br>

But they were. All were targeted. A wealth tax was integrated as well. Slowly, more changes occurred. Prices fluctuated in increase, but fracking was banned. Plant based items rose in demand, though meat was still a loved luxury. Money was poured into healthcare, infrastructure reformation, and public transportation.
  <br><br>

It is now 2060 and I can tell you what these exact changes were. Buildings are being taken apart and rebuilt. During this process, co-housing is prompted. It is not mandated on homeowners, but people typically take in their families or are relocated to government housing. More apartments and small homes are being built, tearing down what used to be the American Dream. It’s a period of crisis for us still. But, more people are employed because of these changes. We need construction workers for this as well as for the faster bullet trains and subways across our nation. The projected need for STEM and agriculture-related workers (doctors, researchers, and farmers) is over 28% more than usual.
  <br><br>

I cannot help but imagine what could have been if we started early. Did Bernie Sanders have the potential to radically change our future? Would those changes have happened and been worth it? Couldn’t we have prevented this even years ago, decades before Bernie Sanders?
  <br><br>

Regardless, we have the president, elected in 2035, who started this all to thank. This candidate was Ken Hiltner, my professor from UCSB (sorry Ken, I didn’t want to put myself. That would be too cheesy). Thank you President Hiltner for paving my way, and the way of America, towards climate activism. We’re not perfect, but we’ve started the movement. And we’re still alive, fighting for our common home, unfortunately with other generations to endure the consequences.




</p><hr>


<p>

In the year 2060, dressing for the climate is difficult. I always make my daughter wear a jacket when we walk to school together in the morning. Most days, she treks home in the oppressive heat with it dangling from her hand. The morning haze of California rarely lasts as long as it did when I was her age, just ten years old, and she laughed and laughed when I first told her about the phrase “June gloom.” She finds rainy days and the occasional foggy morning to be cheerful, and the deadly heat of midday and summer to be gloomy.
  <br><br>

Avoiding the sun is just another way our lives changed as the climate did. As an environmental science teacher, I spend most of my time educating my students on politics more than anything. They’re aghast when they learn about the hemming and hawing that my generation and my parents’ generation participated in. As children who grew up with the Green New Deal initiatives, whose parents work jobs like “solar panel technician” and “wetlands restoration expert,” whose apartment buildings and cohousing kitchens are covered in solar panels and whose yearly field trips consists of visits to wind and geothermal farms, the idea that the integrity of the planet and its climate wasn’t always at the forefront of our politics in the U.S. is inconceivable. As a science teacher, I also sometimes grade lab reports and implement experiments with pond water and mung beans and the like. Most of my students’ curriculum is online, anyways, and I always have to be careful when deciding to implement long-term lab experiments. Physical schooling often shuts down, whether due to oppressive heat or another pandemic caused by viruses released from the thawing ground.
  <br><br>

When I come home to the two bedroom apartment I share with my daughter and partner, I’m thankful we don’t own much. Less to clean, less to arrange. My partner is much more of a minimalist at heart than I was, and she convinced me to jettison the desire for a fully furnished home. We eat simple vegan meals at the kitchen counter, we sit on cushions on the floor (second hand from our local flea market, of course, new things are rare to come by) and play games with the battered pack of cards I owned back in college. We have a tablet that we use to watch television in the evening, and my partner and I share a computer for work. My daughter has a laptop that was issued by her school, and my partner and I still marvel at how streamlined her homework programs are. The complete overhaul of grade school education that occurred back in the 30s was vital to our success as a society. I’m proud of my part in the National Science Teachers Association, and the activism that I did when demanding comprehensive science education for all American students.
  <br><br>

The one thing in our apartment that I refused to budge on was the plants. Even though we rent a plot at our community garden, I still filled our house and most of our balcony with houseplants. Most are herbs we use for cooking, so my partner can’t complain about their “uselessness”, and one is a pot of catnip for our house cat Mabel. The only part of the balcony that I didn’t cover with leafy beings is the home for our clothesline, where my daughter helps me put out our laundry.
  <br><br>

My partner is looking at the election polls for the primaries. She’s already wearing her “I Voted!” sticker, while I tend to put mine on my personal planner. Candidates tend to have a unified view on the climate catastrophe regardless of partisanship (well, except for that one debacle of an election back in 2044). It’s just the fallout from the changing climate that’s debated now. Climate refugees are a large topic in this election; I prefer the Democratic candidate who endorses an open-door policy, while my partner is more interested in policies that send aid to nations most affected by the U.S. and our disastrous past actions. While we argue, about politics and other things, it never gets as bad as the fights I had with my daughter’s father. I doubt my daughter remembers him–we left when she was very little–and I’m very thankful that I had the option and ability to leave him, as a college-educated woman with her finances in her own name. I spare a moment of grief for my grandmother, who only knew a few short decades free from the tyranny of her husband, and I give thanks that my daughter will never know a struggle like that. She’ll be able to earn a college degree without debt, work any job she wants, have access to health insurance and contraceptives no matter her marital status. Parenting, like teaching, boils down to doing the work necessary to let your children have a better life.
  <br><br>

Once the heat of the day is gone, we’re able to do laundry and recharge our electronics. In California, we have a comprehensive geothermal-based energy grid, but there are still financial incentives for not using electricity during the peak of day. So much electricity goes towards air conditioning in schools, business buildings, and hospitals that individual homes are left by the wayside. Still, the evening is here, and we can run our machinery.
  <br><br>

Tomorrow, Wednesday, we’ll take a family trip to the farmer’s market. We know every seller by name; unlike Saturdays, where the entire city seems to congregate, Wednesdays are quiet affairs. We’ll stock up on local produce and handmade toiletries, buying things like jam and honey in reusable glass jars. My daughter lives in a world without plastic, a material relegated firmly to the realm of medical equipment and technology. She’ll never know what it’s like to buy vegetables in Styrofoam and saran wrap. Instead, she’ll skip through the aisles of the farmer’s market, begging me and my partner to pick up a new kind of mushroom, a thick-skinned orange, groaning when we buy kale and broccoli and spinach. I’ll exchange polite words with the farmer who grew the vegetables we bought, sharing ideas on how to use the stems, the leaves. After all: waste not, want not. My daughter will light up when we reach the table full of handmade taffy and fruit candies.  My partner will cave and buy her one, and lace her fingers in mine when my daughter thanks the woman running the stall. My daughter will rush ahead, bull-headed and way too eager, and I’ll think of when I was ten and my mom took me to the farmer’s market. I ate an entire box of raspberries by myself, and held her hand the entire time. It’s a routine we have practiced, the blocking and execution flawless, just another ritual in this material possession we call life. 
  <br><br>

But for now, I hang the laundry out on the line and make a note to fix the button on one of my daughter’s pinafores, and I’ll have to buff the scuffs out of her school shoes soon. Dinner needs to be made, probably a salad that will use up the beet tops we still have from yesterday, and I know my partner needs the chain on her bike to be oiled and I promised to do that soon. My to-do list grows longer as I remember that I have to regrade a student’s test, and arrange a meeting with a parent for another. I spare a moment to look out at the darkening sky, dusk just starting to eat at the horizon, and breathe. My life would likely be unrecognizable to my past self, but I like it a whole lot more than my younger self would ever expect.



</p><hr>


<p>

To my future children, 
  <br><br>

If you had asked me 40 years ago what I thought the future would look like, it definitely wouldn’t be this. It’s the year 2060, and never in a million years did I expect so much progress to be made. I know that you have grown up with the appreciation of our world being a beautiful, natural, wonderful place to live your life, but I did not have this luxury. My adolescence and early adulthood were spent anxious and afraid of the future of our planet, or, unfortunately, the lack thereof. The climate was being destroyed right before my eyes, and I can confidently say that I had never felt so helpless. Our magical Earth was falling apart and no one seemed to care enough to stop it.
  <br><br>

I’m sure your textbooks have taught you everything about this catastrophic time period full of rising sea levels, incredibly hot summers, enormous uncontained wildfires, widespread poverty and famine, environmental injustice, and global climate migration. This dystopian nightmare was real. It was very real, very prevalent, yet everyone seemed to turn a blind eye to everything that was happening. For much of my life, I didn’t know if the Earth would continue to be inhabitable. 
  <br><br>

Because we allowed so much of this climate destruction to continue, your world is immensely different from mine. Irreversible climate change gave us different childhoods, different education systems, different infrastructure, different aspirations in life. Remember the Christmas story you grew up with, the one about Santa and his elves in the South Pole? Well, until 2050, Santa lived in the North Pole. It’s truly crazy to think that when I was a kid, there was enough ice in the Arctic for that story to be believable. I know this may come as a surprise to you, but when I was your age, Environmental Studies 101 wasn’t even a high school graduation requirement. Can you believe they just let people carry on with their selfish lifestyles without being informed of the damage they leave behind? When I was your age, bikes had to share the roads with cars, the education of women was valued less than that of men, and the fossil fuel industry ruled the world. Needless to say, it was an incredibly stressful and frustrating time to feel voiceless in the face of climate denial.
  <br><br>

2020 was a pivotal year for the existence of our planet. Incredible lifestyle changes toward healing our planet started to become mainstream as people finally started to realize just how important and time-sensitive the issue was. Additionally, 2020 held an extremely important election; we finally removed former President Donald Trump out of office, and brought in someone who cares, not only about our planet, but about everyone like the human beings they are. A new wave of previously voiceless adults were finally able to vote, changing the face of politics in the United States. The new president was educated, professional, and understood how to be the leader of a nation. The public regained trust in the government, and influential laws and regulations were made in favor of the planet.
  <br><br>

Growing up, I always wondered if I would be able to come out of those dark times of climate destruction. Now, 40 years later, I can confidently say that I’m proud of humanity. We finally found the beauty of living selflessly, the importance of personal connection, and the inexplicable magic of our Earth.
  <br><br>

XOXO




</p><hr>


<p>

To my future loved ones: 
  <br><br>

40 years ago I was asked to write to you about what we (as the human race) did to help the planet in a time of trying to stop a great amount of climate change that we as humans caused. First let me explain to you what was going through my 20year old mind at the time. It was a time of a lot of stress and confusion because of the COVID-19 virus that was spreading world wide and it had finally reached the country of Santa Barbara. Everything around me is closing down and the government as well as the school is promoting an isolation strategy to help combat this virus. 
  <br><br>

So with events such as these the climate crisis isn't even a concern at the time. Air lines are flying airplanes with no passengers on them so they could keep their business going and yes I know this sounds crazy because now the idea of someone emitting the much amount of carbon into the air is unthinkable but back then there was little to anyone trying to stop it. We used plastic for almost everything from forks, to bags to everyday things that now is all is not just either decomposable or reused. We were causing so much damage to our oceans and wild life, there used to be so many more rainforests and nature reserves that you could go to and just camp at and we all took it for granted. This was a time before the years of horrible air pollution in major cities, that were the causes for them to go environmentally friendly as they are today. There were so many more beautiful things about our world and animals that you sadly will never get to see again. 
  <br><br>

I know for you today this is just the normal life but trust me when I tell you, we have come a long way from when I was your age. For us humans we are never usually the ones to act as precautionary but instead as responders after something has happened and climate change was not an exception. We didn't stop the cutting down of rainforest until there was little to none left. We didn't stop the over fishing of our oceans until millions were starving because there was no more fish in the ocean. We didn't stop the use of nuclear power plants until more devastating accidents that affected millions occurred. We also didn't stop fracking until the earthquakes were becoming so frequent in areas. Many tragedies happened in order to have the world that we live in today and the lifestyle you today enjoy so much. I wish we were able to get to how we live today without all the human suffering that went on but we did learn from our mistakes. Great measures were taken to protect people, of course after a tragedy. The Green New Deal that you today learn of in class came a long way before being implicated and it was changed many times before that. In the year of  my 20s it was when most of these events began to happen and by the beginning of the new decade we began to react. There was finally mass media coverage and push for protection of our oceans, Forrests, and air. Believe it or not we ate so much meat back in my time! There was red meat everywhere, and today we eat a more sustainable plant base diet. Be grateful for the life you have today, we have defiantly fought very hard for it. This is just a snippet of my life at the time and I'll continue my story later on. Love the planet and treat it with great care because it is beautiful and is the only one we have so far.

<p>

A message from the future:
  <br><br>

Hope when you are reading this, you are living on a lovely and beautiful planet where the climate crisis has been mitigated. I am writing to you of this letter from 40 years ago, and hopefully this will influence you in some aspects. I never thought of writing a letter to you on climate crisis, but Professor Ken Hiltner, who is teaching climate crisis course at my last year in UCSB, is providing me this opportunity to do so. 
  <br><br>

It is 2020, and it has been a tough year. It begins with Corona virus, and we have no idea where it  will take us to. And this issue tells me that it is really important to collaborate with each other and everyone’s behavior and decision are affecting our world. Butterfly effect is for real. So does for climate crisis. So far I have been taking actions to do my part to combat the climate crisis. I try to carpool or bike to commute, and reduce the car use in my daily life. Meanwhile, Ken told us that the worst way for our environment is taking flight. I like to travel and I have to go back home through a half earth. And I can only travel during my holidays, so slow travel is not practicable for me. However, I am trying my best to reduce unnecessary travel and as long as I can take bus or train, I will choose it over flight. In anther way, I am trying not to waste food and telling my friends not to have leftovers as well. Even though it seems like an unnecessary thing in our daily life, but it is a big move for our environment. And I think everyone should take personal actions to contribute to our world.
  <br><br>

From the mountain fire to COVID-19, we went through too much, and I think it is important for us to take the climate issue seriously. So far the government enacted the Green New Deal, aiming to address climate change and economic inequality. In many ways, such as renewable energy, smart grid, energy efficiency, the governments are taking actions. The Green New Deal is guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States, which is good for many of us. And I believe this deal will be effective.
  <br><br>
I sincerely hope that next generations will take actions, and I am hopeful that they will do much better than us. I am looking forward to the beautiful future.

A message from the future:
  <br><br>

Dang, looking back 2020 was one hell of a year. We started off just fine but slowly huge ripples changed the current of time and ultimately, the future. For one, the coronavirus became something so widespread and impacted nations globally. You may not remember, but because of it, schools closed down and countries had to go on national lockdown to prevent it from spreading even more than it already was. In addition, hospitals no longer had the resources to take care of so many people because a cure had not yet been discovered.  Due to the fact that travel was restricted, we were able to cut down drastically on our gas emissions. In addition, people began to live more sustainably and only buy what they needed from the grocery stores because of the scarcity of supplies. Lastly, due to the quarantine, many people stopped going out and the emissions emitted from cars was drastically reduced as well. One good thing that came out of this was the realization across the population that change was needed. Our generation helped lead this change. We worked tirelessly to make sure to prevent a global disaster from occurring again.
  <br><br>

On a smaller scale, we all worked to change our diets first. Many people opted for more plant based diets and tried to cut out their meat intake as much as possible. Even your uncle who is notorious for eating at all you can eat KBBQ's and 3x3 in n out burgers as snacks, opted to try eating salads for once and limit his red meat intake. By changing our diets and limiting our meat, we were able to cut down on the emissions that come from the meat industry. 
  <br><br>

Next, on a slightly larger scale we made sure to adopt more minimalistic lifestyles. The whole trend of fast fashion and materialism became abandoned. It definitely took a long time for this to happen but it did happen. More and more people came to realize just how unnecessary buying the latest trends were and luxury cars were no longer needed as well. Bikes became the next big thing and so many bike paths were built. To the market, bank, anywhere you name it, we built it! By living more sustainably, people became happier and healthier. 
  <br><br>

You did great too. You pushed to live in a very minimalistic, small house. By doing so, you were able to consume less resources and less space overall. In addition, you were able to build closer relations with your family by being so close to them all the time. There were more than one benefits to this move.
  <br><br>

As for our government, Bernie Sanders was elected as president and Trump was no longer in office. As our country moved to a more democratic viewpoint, we were able to instate changes that affected our environment positively. The Green New Deal was enacted and our world's carbon emissions were cut drastically. In addition, due to the travel ban, the number of flights were restricted as well which further served to cut gas emissions. Not only was it more sustainable, but everyone became happier as well. 
  <br><br>

Overall, I am so proud of you. From being a twenty year old not knowing much about the climate crisis at the beginning of your winter quarter of college, you came a long way. You not only took away so much information from your class and professor, but you made sure to implement what you learned and encourage others to do the same as well. You told all your friends and family and educated them about the ways in which they could change their lifestyles as well. Slowly but surely, change was made as everyone around you worked to live more sustainably.
  <br><br>

I am so excited for everything that you are going to accomplish and if it wasn't for this class that motivated you to do so, who knows where you will be now? The last piece of advice I have for you is just know that you are on the right track and keep going!



</p><hr>


<p>

To my Daughter, 

  <br><br>

I truly hope that by now, your generation has taken control of the climate crisis, something that my generation and the generation before me failed to do. Back in 2020 the amount of natural disasters that are occurring is absolutely insane. We've had more wildfires and stronger hurricanes in the past few years than ever before. My grandma's generation used to always say that "It's normal, the temperature will rise and it will fall, there is nothing wrong." Because of that mentality, when I was 20, politicians were spreading fake news about the climate, all over the world, convincing people it wasn't a real concern. Luckily by the end of that year, we had elected a democratic president, Joe Biden, and changes started to happen. However, they just weren't big enough changes. Not everyone was fully educated about what they can do individually to help out the climate. While I am so grateful that you and your brother are not stuck in this same situation as your father and I were, we are still not in a great place and I want your kids to have a good chance at a great life.
  <br><br>


If you have ever wondered why you don't have more siblings, it's because overpopulation is a serious issue, and it's best advised to have 2 or fewer children, no more than the number of parents. So as a decision to keep the population from going crazy, we decided to only have you two. Also, I'm so happy that the U.S. finally was successful in cutting down on meat consumption, and you guys have been living on a mainly plant-based diet your entire lives. Back when I was younger, so many people saw eating beef as a necessity, however, cows are extremely dangerous to our environment so it was crucial to limit them. When I was 20, I had already been flexitarian for about 7 years and I was most hopeful that our society could cut meat out of our diets. 
  <br><br>


One thing that has been unusually hard for Americans to tackle, and we still haven't beat it, is the desire for material things and consuming. When I was younger and still today, we all see 'status' as someone who has enough money to buy anything they desire. The problem with that is that production warehouses are dangerous to the environment as well as an overproduction of goods, an excess in the environment. However, I hope I have raised you well enough to know that the materials will not make you immensely happier. 
  <br><br>


I am proud of the progress that we have made in fixing the climate crisis, however, we are nowhere near done. My generation knew exactly how to help fic it and many Americans turned a blind eye and disregarded it. You, my child, cannot. It's crucial that you guys fight for more change. We still need to help future generations to continue our world for as long as possible.

<p>

2020 was the year that started it all. This new decade started with a mass pandemic, amidst the United State's 2020 election. Thankfully, the democrats were able to win the election, Joe Biden, in particular, and were able to establish much better legislation in terms of the planet. AOC was elected to be vice president, and although many people found her tactics extreme, she is the one who made it possible for us all to survive. The carbon levels in our atmosphere started to decrease almost immediately, and by 2030, they were at stable levels. Almost all businesses turned to renewable energy sources and despite a long and hard battle, the use of fossil fuels to power vehicles was eventually outlawed.

  <br><br>

2030, however, faced problems. There was some pushback by republicans who thought that the oil industry was our only way to have good relationships with foreign countries, and for a brief moment, we thought all of our progress would go down the drain. However, with many protests and an extensive fight through congress, the bill to go back to oil was shut down.
  <br><br>


In 2040, the government made even more changes to ensure that future generations would have the best possible earth. ALL energy was made to be renewable and the national park services around the world made it so there were more lands that were restricted to building. 2040 was the decade that the government created a program that traveled to 3rd world countries to provide information about family planning in order to contain a world population. The program was very expensive, however, after it was implemented, we saw a dramatic decline in the birth rate.
  <br><br>


It is now 2060. Looking at satellite images from NASA and comparing them to the ones taken in 2020 is absolutely crazy. Through all the hard work, major world catastrophes were avoided and the world is back to being beautiful. There will always be room to improve, but, things we did? That.




</p><hr>


<p>

AOC begins her video by saying that, “It’s often said that, “You can’t be what you can’t see.’” After hearing this I imagined the future and allowed myself to “see” what could happen even if it wasn’t right in front of my eyes, inspired by the words of AOC at the end of her video when she states, “We can be whatever we have the courage to see.”
  <br><br>
In the new decade of 2020, it was our time to act. There was no room for complacency; sweeping cultural change was beginning to be accepted as an urgent solution to the decades of plaguing our earth with CO2 and toxic fossil fuels.
  <br><br>
Finishing off my first year of college I finally transitioned to a fully vegan diet and lifestyle, making sure that everything I consumed was vegan and cruelty-free. Don’t be fooled, this wasn’t a completely easy transition. There were definitely many slip-ups with chocolate and products that I hadn’t even realized contained animal products. Although a few of my close friends had been vegan for years, so I was provided with a small, yet strong and supportive community to help me along the journey. 
  <br><br>
At the start of my second year in college, 2020-2021, I moved into an apartment with my friends. We practiced composting and made large vegan dinners together every Friday. Switching from the dining halls, which had labels on everything that was vegan, to moving in an apartment and cooking for myself was a big change. My family had been vegan in 2011, so my mom sent me tons of vegan recipes and cookbooks which made the process a little easier. Cooking meals that were sustainable, but that my mom used to make me, gave me a sense of nostalgia and a sense of joy because of how easy and delicious a sustainable meal can be. 
  <br><br>
My roommates and I also utilized our backyard space and planted a variety of species from tomatoes, to strawberries, various other fruits and vegetables, and many herbs. Not only did this build a stronger bond between us as friends, but our bond with earth and nature was strengthened as well. Although it may sound cheesy, we became one with the earth. This bond faded during Winter Quarter as school got busier and we failed our strawberries as amateur plant parents, but once Spring Quarter rolled around we got back in the swing of things. Using fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs truly changes the taste of a meal. It almost makes you feel pure inside after eating something that just came out of the ground and is so full of nutrients. 
  <br><br>
By 2030, I rode my bike everywhere along with a large portion of the population. I moved back to Long Beach from Santa Barbara after undergrad. Public transportation went fully electric and the majority of the cars on the road were hybrid or electric. By 2040 all cars on the road had to be zero-emission across California. This change didn’t affect me that much, as I had decided not to use cars or travel on airplanes. I took my last flight in March of 2020. I thought that I would regret swearing off airplanes and felt that I was going to miss out on seeing the rest of the world. Yet, in fact, I decided that I would make a point of taking advantage of the beauty within my own country. There is so much beauty in places that you wouldn’t even expect to find it. I learned that nature and humans have a deep connection that prevails through time and generations. It is something deep within us that we should explore. Seeing nature and becoming one with the earth exposes you to different parts of yourself and gives you an appreciation for mother nature. This intrinsic shift made living a sustainable, “climatarian” life more meaningful and rewarding. 
  <br><br>
By 2060, I transitioned to a minimalist lifestyle. This had not just become something popular, but almost the norm by 2060. Living unsustainably was looked down upon and seen as morally wrong. Not only was my closet small and simple along with my house, but life as a whole became simple. And simple doesn’t just mean boring; I had much more time to focus on my relationships with family, friends, the earth, and myself. The consumer culture of the ’20s (2020) faded as the years went by. The implementation of the carbon tax allowed for the transition of all consumer products to be sustainable. Along with becoming more sustainable, excess products and new fashion/fads became something of the past. The culture shifted and humans began to truly care about the earth and the anthropogenic impact.  
  <br><br>
I will end my reflection on the future by sharing a quote from twitter that states, “Climate change needs to hire Corona Virus’s publicist.” I believe that those words sum up where we stand at the start of 2020 and I’m anxious to see where we will end up in 2060.



</p><hr>


<p>
A message from the future:
  <br><br>


The year is 2060. It’s been forty years since my freshman year in college, and I’m proud to say things are a lot different now, from four decades ago. 
  <br><br>


My first quarter in UCSB I took a class called English 22: Literature in the Environment. I knew little about climate change, so i was eager to learn more, but this class completely opened my eyes to the horrors happening right before me. They say “ignorance is bliss,” and I agree because after learning so much, I felt hopeless. The following quarter I took English 23, The Climate Crisis: What It Is and What Each of Us Can Do About It. Professor Ken, equipped me, along with another 800 or so students, with the information necessary to make sustainable, and environmentally sound choices and changes. I stopped eating meat, and began incorporating more plant-based foods to my diet. Personal changes weren’t the only solution to our problem. I also voted for the first time ever! With more knowledge about the Green New Deal, carbon tax, fees and dividends, politics, I felt better prepared and with a glimpse of hope. The fossil fuel-loving-boomers were going to leave us a dying planet, a rigged economic system, and we (the younger generation) knew it was time for change.
  <br><br>


It wasn't until the whole coronavirus situation when more people realized our country was fundamentally broken. Medicare for all and paid sick leave were absolutely necessary. People were going to work, despite health risks to avoid losing their job. While countries like China, Vietnam, and South Korea were testing all their citizens, and providing other free resources, the US was trying to create a test kit they could profit from. FUCK capitalism. It was everything that was wrong with our country. 
  <br><br>


Fast forward to now, we live in a completely different country than 40 years ago. We have medicare for all, free education, living wages, humane jobs, and a sustainable economy. A huge step that was pivotal towards accomplishing this was getting Bernie in office. Through him, we saw that all the things conservatives claimed to be impossible for decades. Cutting off fossil fuels was the greatest change we made. It took some time, and admittedly, not everything was easy, but we successfully transitioned to 100% renewable energy. Eliminating our use for fossil fuels freed 50% of the military budget, which allowed more spending for improvements. Road infrastructure was altered for busses and bikes, which today are the main methods of transportation. Taking the bus now is nothing like forty years ago. No more waiting an eternity for  a bus just to see it is quite literally packed and have to wait (even more) for the next one. Most importantly, we have become a more humane society. We have jobs with living wages, paid sick leave, medicare, education. We were once the biggest producers and consumers in the world, and that nearly took us all out. Many refused to believe in a United States running without fossil fuels, yet here we are, thriving. Like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez once said, “we can be anything we have the courage to see.” My generation had the courage to see us in a country independent of fossil fuels, and here we are, making history.

  <br><br>

A message TO the future:

  <br><br>

If I am reading this, that probably means I made it to sixty years old without dying due to the climate crisis. I hope that you (I?) are vegan by now, and hopefully have been for decades. I hope we did indeed make the correct decisions, elect the right politicians and most importantly, I hope we did cut fossil fuels off completely. When i read this, i will either be super proud of how far we have come, or extremely disappointed that 18-year-old me was right about being so pessimistic. I pray to God that is not the case. I hope that I did all I could to help the planet and fight capitalism. I hope we all did.




</p><hr>


<p>

To my future self:

  <br><br>



I remember what it felt like being you, sitting in the middle of a climate crisis that seemed hopeless, and feeling so unsure of what the future looked like. I am here to tell you that, eventually, after a lot of loss and change, everything is going to be ok. 


  <br><br>


Let’s start at 2020, the year you are currently in, in a world where people still are trying to deny the existence of climate change and the government is wasting time debating over its relevance. In the past few years, you’ve seen many natural disasters as a result of climate change, ranging from hurricanes to multiple large and destructive fires. Unfortunately, this only gets worse. However, as tragic as it seems, this is the wakeup call that people need and it gets to a point where it is no longer possible to argue against making drastic changes to save our planet. America finally starts to transition away from the fossil fuel industry and begins focusing on renewable energy and providing efficient public transportation across the country. New plans are put in place to reduce food wastage and restrict the horrific environmental impacts of the fast fashion industry. In a combined effort with the rest of the world, our society begins making and enforcing big lifestyle changes, and our carbon emissions slowly start to steadily go down.

  <br><br>


This means big changes for you personally too. You will have to learn to drastically reduce your car use, eat as a climatarian, and curtail shopping/consumerism. Although these changes seem like a lot right now, soon you and everyone around you will work together and push/motivate each other in a collective effort to save the planet. 

  <br><br>


The coming years will be difficult. Natural disasters, rising sea levels, and many more consequences of climate change will be prevalent. However, just remember that you will get to be a part of the generation that fights for change and eventually wins just in time to save the planet!



</p><hr>


<p>

As I sit on my 60th birthday, watching all of my dear friends and family celebrate my life, I take this time to reflect on my past and the many things I have done that have made these years feel fulfilled. I thought I would write this to you all to share the history of my generation from the perspective of your grandmother. My memory goes as far back as playing with rollie pollies and other insects in the backyard of my after school childcare center in elementary school. I remember being fascinated with all of the things that surround us. Throughout middle school, dance stole my heart and majority of my teen years, and I have not a single regret. But while pursuing my bachelor’s degree at  UCSB is when things started to change, and when my life got interesting.

  <br><br>



2020 was the time for change. I was a second year in college and our campus was bursting with activism. The primary elections were upon us and if you were on the same side of things as I was, you were fighting to get Trump out of office and to take back the White House. I was rooting for democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, and to my delight, we accomplished this goal. Bernie promised us amazing things once he took presidency, and among them all, the Green New Deal and implementing real policy to mitigate the climate crisis was of my top priorities. 
  <br><br>


The climate crisis, as you will come to learn if you have not already, started way before your time. Hell, it started way before my time. This same year, I enrolled in a climate crisis class and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I learned about what the crisis was, the facts behind it, and what we needed to do about it if our planet was going to remain habitable in the future. This sent me off on my journey of climate/environmental activism, as well as social justice activism, to spread the knowledge I was ready to share with the world. 

  <br><br>

Although Bernie was elected to office, it did not mean everything would be accomplished smoothly. It took time for the Green New Deal to actually be passed by Congress. Many were still concerned about the realities of the Green New Deal, and to me and many others, that just meant we had to push harder. I started participating in rallies and protests, and acted as an educator to anyone who seeked more knowledge about the climate crisis. It was a liberating experience and sometimes even ran me into trouble. Your grandma was even arrested for her passion and determination. Finally, Bernie passed the Green New Deal and people like me gained back their faith in humanity. 

  <br><br>

We believed we had a real shot at making change, and we did! Infrastructure was changing to accommodate eco-friendly ways of transportation such as bikes and buses, a carbon tax was implemented into society, and bans on fracking were becoming widespread. Many more people began to accept the idea of switching to eco friendly meat substitutes and limiting their food waste. Flying became a thing of little occurrence, and there are alternative ways of overseas travel still out there but that is a job for your generation. There was a collective act of change occurring in societies across the nation. This did not occur all overnight, but within 10-15 years, many things were accomplished that we never could have imagined. We were finally doing what we should have a long time ago to mitigate the crisis. 
  <br><br>


Not only did we see changes in the environment, but we saw change in our lives. People began to seem happier and kinder. Social equality was at levels never reached before. The best part about this all was how we began to aid underdeveloped nations in their journeys to gaining access to resources they need. I do not know what happened in enough people or why, but it was a great time to be alive. The world became the place we envisioned all of those years ago, and sitting here watching my grandkids and knowing they have a future that was once not guaranteed, brings me so much joy. I hope you guys continue fighting for what you believe in and keep making change, no matter how impossible it seems. To quote Ghandi, one my climate crisis professor often said, “Be the change you wish to be in the world.” 


</p><hr>


<p>

To my future son/daughter, 
  <br><br>

Hi my child, I hope by the time you are reading this the climate crisis has been nearly almost or maybe even fully eliminated. It is currently the year 2060 and I am writing this letter to you because I want to explain how climate change has been affecting the world for several years and how it has improved over the years, ultimately how we have gotten to the progression of today's conditions. 
  <br><br>

Honestly, growing up I did not really think about climate change too much. I mean at my house growing up your grandparents would tell us to recycle simple items like cans and bottles but that was pretty much it. It was not until I took a course during winter quarter called English 23 The Climate Crisis, my second year as an undergrad at UCSB. This class was a GE class that ultimately allows students to explore human-caused climate change for what it is and address it as a human problem brought by human actions. We explored why we do these disastrous actions to the planet and our species if they are so bad for the environment. 
  <br><br>

In 2020 the climate crisis was really at a dangerous point, a point where we needed to make a change immediately at that time or else it was going to be too late. Taking English23 helped me gain a better understanding of the climate crisis and I started to want to make small changes in my personal life to help the environment. My way of thinking was that I knew that people were so accustomed to their ways of living with the booming technology and idea of living at the time was “the bigger is better,” and I knew I was not going to be able to drastically gather everyone to make a huge impact, so why not start my own small actions hoping they will influence the people around me then hopefully spreading to serval people. So some things I started implementing included consuming less meat, beginning to carpool and bike more often, and switched to solar power energy. It was a little challenging at first to get into this lifestyle but with time I got used to it and adjusted quite well and can now say I am currently consuming a fully vegan diet. 
  <br><br>

It is now 2060 and our world has greatly progressed. The Green New Deal that was passed at the beginning of 2021 is what brought the nation together in tackling the climate crisis and is the reasoning behind the many things you consider today to be normal but were big changes to society in 2021. The Green New Deal was ultimately a proposal that aimed to address climate change and economic inequality with modern ideas such as renewable energy and resource energy. This is why we currently have a national power generation of 100% renewable resources. A carbon tax was also created which charges people a tax for the amount of fossil fuels they take out of the ground. This helped people become more conscious of their actions knowing that they were being charged based on their actions. Culture in the world was ultimately starting to change collectively and it was getting quite noticeable. 
  <br><br>

Since I dedcided to change my lifestyle before the pass of the Green New Deal, friends and family members turned to me to ask me in the time of this change about what I have been doing and wanted to learn from me and more about the changes they can implement into their daily lifestyles as well. Educating the people around you and spreading knowledge is a great way to make a change and I want you guys to remember this. So whether its something like the climate crisis or anything you want to change in the world go for it. It may start with small actions that only yourself may notice but with time I promise you if you stay with it it will lead to bigger change. So I encourage you to help make the world a better place for everyone and do not be afraid of taking part in change! 
  <br><br>

With much love,  <br><br>

Mom



</p><hr>


<p>

To my child:
  <br><br>


It is 2060. You are seeing a more beautiful day than I ever saw in my childhood. The generation before me left us with many things to fix, I hope my generation took away one of those things--the climate crisis. You are breathing clean, healthy air. You are sitting in a room with clean, renewable energy floating around you. You are wearing sustainable, ethical clothing. And you are living life with not as much stuff, but way more happiness. I am not here to toot my own horn, but the people before you had to take giant leaps of faith for not only ourselves, but for you. The world had to do a lot. But I wanted to tell you what part I had in all of this. 
  <br><br>


Fashion. One of my favorite things is fashion. I stopped buying fast fashion. Back in my day, Forever 21 and H&M were huge stores. Now they have downsized majorly ever since we passed a law in 2030, that banned all unethical fashion. We used to get clothes fast, in any size, color, trend, style, and time of day. It was all done by people who worked in sweatshops. These sweatshops were gross, unsafe, and immoral. So, I got my clothes from secondhand stores, and I had to deep-dive into research about companies/brands being ethical and sustainable. Clothes that were broken down, didn't fit, or that I didn't like anymore, were upcycled! the sewing machine became my best friend as I turned pair of jeans into crazier pairs of jeans, aprons, handbags, hair accessories, and etc. Not only was it fun, I wasn't throwing anything away. I brought a bag of unwanted clothes with me to family gatherings, so little cousins, aunties, or grandmothers could pick out whatever they liked. People started upcycling and wearing secondhand clothes and it became culturally normal. 

  <br><br>

Food. I was already vegetarian for years. But not everything I ate was environmentally conscious. I became a climatarian but this took some research unto what I was eating and when I was eating it. It definitely was more feasible than veganism to me, but it did take thought and planning. Lots of people in my community became plant-based, mainly vegetarians, but some still ate meat. 
  <br><br>


Transportation and home living. I moved to a big city, where I didn't have to rely on a car. I started taking public transport and I walked everywhere! In 2040, the streets became much clearer and we had more accessible bike lanes, so I biked everywhere. I got an electric bike and have been fit and thriving ever since. My spouse and I moved in with each other in a micro apartment. It was just enough space for us. We practiced minimalism in the home, though we would not call ourselves minimalists. We kept the space open in our apartment. I would have preferred life with no children but I was very flexible. Your mother/father/parent, however, definitely wanted children. With the climate in mind, we decided on one child and that they would be adopted--YOU!
  <br><br>


Besides making changes to my own lifestyle, I helped to make changes to others and encouraged others to take political action. I got heavily involved with an organization for BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) environmentalists. We fought for healthier communities, demanded funding for education and resources, and put a stop to building refineries and other polluting industries in powerless and vulnerable communities. 

  <br><br>

Do not fall for the same mistakes my generation and past generations have made. There is still more to fix, so never quit fighting to make the world a better place for your children and beyond. We don't have to wait until the last minute to fix things, either. We can do it right now. 
</p><hr>

Well, isn't it funny how we always end up from where we started, the beginning of our environmental enlightenment? Well either way, future self, you have come back to your beginning with some type of reason and hopefully it is for the better or good. Hopefully, by time your reading this, the government has finally gotten it's head wrapped around the fact that the dangers of the climate crisis were more real than they ever believed from their corrupt money and interest from major fossil fuel industries, and hopefully sooner than later as action in many ways should have been taken as soon as possible in a time of crisis. Maybe you finally stuck through and graduated from bio and now are using your ways to better help the world? I'm thinking to much, but anyway, the time is crucial.
  <br><br>
Hopefully, and I'm saying this with a great amount of sincerity, the people of the future, your time, have gotten there head straight about the climate crisis and the threat it poses for all life on the planet. Hopefully, major think tanks like PragerU are exposed to the public and that the many other climate deniers as well for clouding the belief and understanding of the climate change for many many people around the United States and other sectors of the world. 
  <br><br>
I have always been pessimistic and you know this future me, but what I am saying is that I hope that my pessimism is wrong for this time. That we are to have  beautiful and bright future with blue skies that were never scratched by the claws of carbon. A future knowing that my kids will grow up understanding what it is to breathe free and cherish the fine oxygen that grazes our lungs and brings us life. I don't want to spend my future living like it's Dr. Seuss's The Lorax where we have to by air and the next big industries are air companies who take advantage of the situation for there own selfish needs. As one of our favorite quotes from the beloved Charlie Chaplin states, "The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.
  <br><br>
.. Greed has poisoned men’s souls". Don't let this happen, and hopefully you didn't, don't let greed poison the soul of the people. Let them understand and the whole world that this is our home. 
  <br><br>
I feel myself repeating myself over and over but, Hiltner taught us something, and it's obvious why your back. It is because he was right, right from the beginning speaking as a man from a generation that turned their back on the rest for the sake of their own self righteousness, not for the planet's well goodness. I just hope, that he was right in that the future, the earth would be free of emissions and our home and lives free from toxicity that possess our air...

A message from the future:

  <br><br>

I still remember being a first-year at UCSB in 2020. I signed up for an English class about the Climate Crisis, since it combined two things I was very interested in. At first, I absolutely hated this class. The lectures bored me, the professor wouldn’t let me leave early, and I had to do SO much reading. Eventually though, as I went to more lectures and kept doing more readings, I got really into the class. I started to understand the severity of the climate crisis, and realized that humanity needed to make some serious changes if we wanted to have any hope of saving our Earth. My classmates started realizing it, too. Many of us in the class started doing our part in fixing the planet. Personally, I stopped eating red meat. The documentary “Cowspiracy” really changed my perspective on agribusiness, and I couldn’t eat a burger anymore without feeling guilty. Some people in my class stopped driving their cars, while others fought to get Bernie Sanders elected. As you obviously probably know already, he won! He was the only candidate progressive enough to implement drastic environmental policies to save our planet. One of these policies was an increased carbon tax. This carbon tax discouraged people from wanting to use things that made them pay more to use carbon, and eventually, people found alternatives. I personally found a love for biking. I remember some Conservatives being so upset that President Sanders made some massive overhauls on American culture, but overtime, we as a society educated everyone on the severity of the situation. For once, everyone was on the same page that we needed to drastically change our ways if we had any chance of sustaining our planet. I felt kind of bad watching so many airlines close due to low plane ticket sales, but I knew it meant that less planes were going into the air and therefore emitting less greenhouse gases. Now, in 2060, I am personally working with my local city council to make important changes in our city. The biggest changes always start small.

<p>
To my future child: 
   <br><br>

2020 was the year we needed change. 
  <br><br>
 
As I sat in my freshman dorm, I was filled with a mixture and hope and fear. I was scared to be growing up in a time of chaos, filled with anger about the lack of action that is being taken. There were days that I was frustrated and it all seemed futile, but there were also days when I was filled with hope and excitement. I grew up unaware and then became indifferent about the climate crisis. I never thought it was that serious, my thoughts were always focused on other things. When I reached college this all completely changed. I felt so lucky to go to UCSB where the culture was focused on being environmentally friendly. I was able to take many environmental studies classes, learning about the horrific situation we have created for ourselves. As I sat and learned about ocean levels rising, global temperatures raising, and natural disasters destroying towns, I was filled with rage. Rage that was transformed into action. 
  <br><br>
 
I look back and am so glad that I was someone who decided to stand up for what I believed in. I went vegetarian and then vegan, as I tried to lower my personal carbon footprint. I raised my children with heavily plant-based diets, hoping to make my family environmentally conscious. I went to rallies and protests in college and then throughout my life, raising my voice for the future. I took my children to events and educated them on how their actions matter. I voted for politicians who fought for the environment. I bought small houses and apartments and went as plastic free as I could. I tried to thrift when I could and tried to live with less. 
  <br><br>
 
None of this was easy, though. It took personal discipline and creativity to live with a smaller carbon footprint. Many people used to tell me that my personal actions wouldn’t make a difference. I understood what they were saying, but I knew that we could either all give up, or we could all work to change our culture. Changing our culture cannot be done alone, our government plays a big role. While I voted for politicians who promised change, it came slowly. Change was incremental and slowly legislation was passed. Carbon fees, the end of fracking, and business using less greenhouse gases all came with each new president. Each 4 years brought a new wave of small change. It was frustrating to watch, as I sat and wondered if small changes would ever make a difference. 
  <br><br>
 
Looking back, those small changes were the start of a new way of life. Those changes slowed down climate change and will only be made better with your generation. Those changes wouldn’t have happened without personal action and collective action. I am proud to say that I stood up for the planet and the future I know I wanted.

 A Letter from a Concerned Child:  <br><br>

When I was your age, my life was full of what to be and who to become. Now that close to 40 years have passed, I can only look at my past accomplishments and be proud. Deep down, I still feel like the child, one with expansive imagination and hope. I’m handing you this hope, the same one I’ve had since I was your age. Don’t underestimate the power that comes with these ideals; it will serve as your motivation to do better and progress.
   <br><br>

I want to share what my generation has accomplished. It’s been a wild 40 years in the fight for change. We finally shifted the culture of greed and selfishness to one full of community and health. Our lifestyle now consists of an aware state for energy conservation. Thousands of communal gardens are available to feed people of all classes. Streets are now filled with electric bikes and cars are now a rare sight. Our resources are now used to improve the individual, not huge conglomerates.  Do note, this shift did not occur quickly, but it took a nationwide wave of small policy changes that ultimately came through during these extensive years. There are still some selfless individuals out there, but we will always be ahead and morally above them. 
   <br><br>

To my children, please carry on my spirt of my own childhood. There is so much more progress to be made in our world. Help others reach comfort that would allow them to grow and process. Find your true happiness in mediums that excel that of materialism. As a collective, we can make the world such a better place as the past generation has made. We made progress, don’t stop this momentum and don’t ever think we can’t do it because it is completely doable. I hope this message so you can reach the hearts of many as it did for my generation. Love the future and love yourself,

</p><hr>


<p>
To my future self,
   <br><br>

Hey, it’s me. I am glad you are reading my letter now. It’s me from the future 2060. I want to tell you the world has changed a lot, a lot. Yes, it does get worse to some extent, but I want to thank you and tell you that you and your generation did a great job and put a lot of efforts on saving the planet for the future. Please, please believe in yourself, and also the power that you hold in your hands and please try your best to embrace the change. When we see change, it’s not always a bad thing. Think positively, if our earth didn’t give us some warnings, how could you and your generation raise your awareness to change the world and the climate in a positive way? Right? I hope you keep teaching your children, and their generations to do the right things. Trust me, the world will be a better place when everyone puts a little more effort into it!! The future is in your hand. I can see it! Don’t be afraid of the changes and all the bad things that would happen in the future. Keep doing what you think is right. And be the change you want to see in the world!!

<p>
In 40 years, we will look back at the past several decades and will see the progress we made to halt the climate crisis.  Coupled with this, we will also see our failures caused by a rise of extremists and an inevitable rise of corporate power.  But will it be enough?

   <br><br>

We will see the collapse of the current political structure and a reorganization around the fundamental issues related to the climate crisis.  Legislation such as the Green New Deal will be implemented, paving the way to a more equitable and sustainable future.  Corporate interests will lobby against these plans, as it would cripple their market in the short term.  Despite this, these plans will pass as the majority of people come to realize how badly we have damaged the planet.  Even attempts to pass alternative facts or educational methods will fail as people come to grips with frequently occurring disasters they have not seen before (i.e. tornados in California).  

   <br><br>

We will see a mass revolution against these corporations who have denied and known about the climate crisis for decades.  New policies passed by this new congress will devastate their markets and force change to renewable resources.  A carbon tax will decrease people’s dependency on cars and grid-based power. More people will install solar power and cities/states will receive benefits from the federal government for use of renewable generation.  Despite this, the progress will likely come too late and we will be in a situation only savable by more extreme intervention.  

   <br><br>

A network of high-speed electric rail will be constructed between all major cities in the U.S. As time passes, smaller regional trains will be implemented, ultimately leading to every city in the country being connected by train.  We will also create a surplus of buses and other mass transit options.  We will provide a tax break and subsidize these options so that they become cheap and viable.  Furthermore, we will create bus only lanes through major cities that will allow for a quicker commute.  Once this plan has been implemented, a government-controlled app or system will be implemented that allows people to search prices and times for various trips they wish to take.  

   <br><br>

In addition to high speed rail, certain modes of transit will cease to exist in affordable forms.  For example, flights across the U.S. will no longer fly except for specific times at very high prices.  Though this will not harm the mega corporations who will treat it as business as usual, it will decrease demand for these flights.  Furthermore, all public parking will start being eliminated, increasing the difficulty for the remaining car owners to use their vehicles.  They will instead have to focus on using city buses, which will be implemented in a manner that allows for a station every quarter mile.  

   <br><br>

The elimination of the current fossil fuel companies will undoubtedly hurt the market.  Even as these workers shift to other jobs, the economy will see a slowdown.  Even with the Green New Deal and other climate related legislature creating new jobs in the rail and power industry, we will have a recession.  People will wonder if what we are doing is necessary.  No action the government can take will fully eliminate this issue, but as long as there is transparency, there is a chance.  
   <br><br>


We will implement new forms of education such as universal childcare and universal basic education that will ensure future generations do not repeat the mistakes of the past ones.  We will implement a healthcare system that will not bankrupt families when uncontrollable events happen such as cancer or a workplace accident.  We will encourage and, in some cases, force other countries to follow these above plans, for the future of our planet depends on it.  However, as we have benefitted from these technologies for such a long time, we will need to provide the economy of scale and technology to these countries so that they do not suffer for our transgressions.  But once the technology is viable and we have helped them achieve an acceptable standard of living, countries that are blatantly ignoring these guidelines will either need more help or sanctions to try and encourage positive change.  This will be a time of great strife, but we will get it done for the simple reason that there is no planet B.  

   <br><br>

Lastly, we will focus on reeducating both women and men, so that they understand an increasing population is unsustainable.  We will encourage families to only have up to two children and will possibly even provide benefits for these children.  These children will grow up in a world slowly recovering from the effects of the climate disaster and will help continue to be the change that this climate vanguard started.  

   <br><br>

Is this all possible? Yes.  Will it be easy? No.  Many people have a hard time looking past the present as described in the tragedy of the commons.  Nonetheless, it is vital to start acting in the next few years.  If we wait longer, it will not be just the previous generations who have failed us.  We too will have failed the world and caused permanent harm to our planet’s ability to s

A message from the future: 
   <br><br>

I stand here today to address you all in celebration of the 40th Anniversary year since 2020 when the Great Change began. Let’s take a look back at the year 2020. Global climate temperatures and sea levels were rising at alarming rates, species were dying off, and the entire human population was threatened. The most powerful elected officials in the United States were doing nothing to combat the issue, and many young Americans, myself included, were fearful of the future. In January, the coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China and began to spread around the globe. By March, over 100,000 people had been infected with the virus and millions were affected by it. Thousands of people died tragically from the virus. It was a catastrophe unlike any I had seen in my life thus far. But there was a positive side that had yet to be recognized; CO2 emissions went down. Because of travel restrictions, millions of less people used air travel, and many used their cars way less due to working from home or staying home from school. About a year after the pandemic began, as it was finally dying down, people began to reflect on how the climate had been affected. Many people felt extremely hopeful by the fact that CO2 emissions went down because it proved that collectively, we could do something to change to world. By this time, the White House was now occupied by a democrat and the Green New Deal was used as a format to pass legislation that would combat climate change. In addition, the recent pandemic had caused a widespread recognition of the risk in flying, especially the risk of catching diseases so easily. This led to a general willingness for companies in many countries to require their employees to fly less, as well as for people to choose other modes of transportation instead. Over time, each person made small changes that affected CO2 emissions. We saw a global decrease in birth rates, and the population slowly began to even out. We learned from past occurrences of forest fires and became better at preventing them. As my generation came into power, we were able to pass legislation around the globe that lowered emissions and reduced the speed of climate change. Today, we still live in a world that is suffering from our actions as human beings, however, we are no longer headed towards collapse.

Hi, I am from 40 years in the future. When I was freshman in college, I both took ENGL22 and ENGL23. It may seems like a literature class, but it talked about climate crisis. At that time, the environment was facing a great challenge which need all of people overcame it together. The generation of us was the most important part of protecting the environment. Because of the development of the society, increasing exploitation of fossil fuels produced to many green house gas and increased the temperature. But at that time, everything could be changed. Professor Ken provided different means to protect our environment and slow down the global warming. Please try theses means as quickly as possible. It seems a little thing for you, but it can make a great change in the future. 
   <br><br>

Nowadays, climate change is much sever than forty years ago. The consequences of climate change is not only increasing temperature, but also famine, wars, diseases and so on. Something beautiful and precious has gone because of climate crisis. All of the coral have died, we cannot go to the island to see them. Also, the ice bergs in the poles is melting, and some virus trapped in ice bergs are released. Some people are facing great danger because of the infectious disease. Additionally, the temperature is too high to plant crops, so people do not have enough food to survive. Countries also fight with each other for the scarce resource. All of things above are the sever consequences of climate change. So you still have chances to make some changes.
   <br><br>

In Ken’s lecture, we have some plausible means to slow down climate change. First, people can change their diet, so they can eat less beef and more vegetable, because beef will consume too much water and produce methane which is also a kind of green house gas. Second, people can reducing their housing area. Because people always have enough space to accommodate their items, they feel free to buy something new. If people just have limited space, they will think about whether they need it. Third, people can choose public transportation and reducing times of taking plane. They also can reduce times of driving a car.  In forty years ago, some countries have implement carbon tax. Please keep it.




</p><hr>


<p>

To my future self, 

   <br><br>

Right now (March 2020), everything seems incredibly uncertain in regards to the future of our planet and our species, particularly given the recent administration, but all is not yet lost. You still have a chance to be a key force in enacting change and political action on climate change. This country still has a chance to reform its policies and reinvent the way it functions to create an equitable, sustainable economy that works for everyone instead of preying on the masses to continuously gratify the few. We still have a chance to make a cultural change that encourages environmentalism as a principle of a functional and successful society, all while taking into regard the communities that are most vulnerable and at risk. 
   <br><br>
I would argue that the climate crisis is the most critical issue of our generation, and the current COVID-19 pandemic only highlights the flaws in our current political system and social culture that are currently allowing for the persistence of both the climate crisis and the glaring inequalities that it results from. Across the United States and around the world currently, people are being sent home from school and work without pay and somehow expected to pay ridiculous rents; people are avoiding going to the doctor’s office to be tested or treated for COVID-19 while they are sick because of the astronomical costs of the necessary tests and treatment under quarantine, and people who are unable to afford to stock up en masse on expensive items like baby formula or essentials like baby wipes, paper towels, and toilet paper because the comfortably rich have the means to buy 26 flats/stacks of these items at one time, effectively robbing others of the things they need to survive because of their systematically ensured inability to afford to purchase necessity items in bulk or take off work at leisure without pay to avoid exposing themselves or others to the virus.
   <br><br>
Please do not overlook the connection between mass shortages and injustices such as those occurring all around us in the United States (and around the world) due to COVID-19 and the systematic inequalities and societal structures that have allowed the climate crisis to reach the dramatic point of no return that it seems doomed to reach. We have approximately 10 years left to take dramatic and immediate action on the global climate crisis according to the most recent IPCC report on climate change, and that’s merely a possible timeline. We could reach that point much sooner if the president elected in 2020 has vested interests and ties to the fossil fuel industry and big business in this country. 
   <br><br>
As I think has been evidenced during Trump’s presidency over the last few years, our climate crisis has reached an alarming state. In the last four years alone, we have seen countless major disasters, the severity of which have rarely been felt throughout history including Hurricane Harvey along the Gulf Coast/Texas coastline, Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, the Camp Fire in Paradise, CA; and the Thomas Fire in your own home of Santa Barbara, CA. The evidence climate change was something you once heard about in terms of seemingly complicated data trends on temperature change and rises in sea level, but not something you noticed in your day to day life, let alone something that impacted or disrupted your day to day life. You grew up not knowing any better, not noticing that summers were slowly getting hotter or that thunder storms and hurricanes were getting more severe. And if you didn’t know about any of this until your late teens, as was the case for you and many others in this generation, how could you have possibly known about the injustices that human caused climate change was producing all around you? The answer is simple: You grew up with privilege. You grew up white, in a middle class neighborhood in central California nowhere near the rapidly receding shorelines, with state provided health and dental insurance, and thanks to your narrow and every reason to believe that the environmental crisis was one that could be solved with simple changes like shorter showers, electric cars, and recycling. You were naive to any of the issues climate change produced for all of the years since the research on climate change has been collectively reviewed and validated simply because they did not touch you. The system ensured that they didn’t. But for all of those years that you didn’t feel it, there was a child in Louisiana living in what is known infamously as “Cancer Alley” being surrounded by and immersed in a toxic mixture of cancer causing chemicals on a daily basis, simply because the government decided to put their heavily polluting factory in a largely impoverished community of color, again, simply because it knew it could. 
   <br><br>
So the question becomes, what will our future administration look like? Will it look something like what has been envisioned by Alexandra Ocasio Cortez, where the Democratic party takes back the White House in 2020, or will it be another four years under the increasingly intense and disastrous leadership of Donald Trump (I recognize that while this is a letter to myself, others can see this comment so argue with me if you will. Other policies aside, I think we can all agree Trump has never been pro-environment)? Truthfully, I think it will fall somewhere in the middle. Right now you (me) are riding the Bernie train and will ride it til the end. But the reality is, either Biden or Trump could very easily still win. And though Biden is a democrat, he has historically supported a lot of pro-oil policies and expansions, which is the exact opposite of what we need to be doing. The climate crisis is an incredibly complex issue that will be arguably impossible to solve under capitalism. Whether you support Bernie or not, this country needs a president and an administration that will address climate change at its core with inequality. There should not be oil billionaires living lavish lives without a worry while people are losing their lives and their homes to climate injustice. 
   <br><br>
Only time will tell, but we must do everything we can to make as much noise about this issue as possible while we can, regardless of which administration is put into place following the November 2020 election. This generation needs to make it an issue that cannot be ignored. We need to demand change and take collective action (as well as individual action) to enact lasting change on climate policy and the issues of inequality from which climate change and climate injustice stem.

<p>
To my future self,   <br><br>
 
I remember how scared you were back in 2020 about the plight of our planet and what the future held. Afterall at the time things weren’t looking good. We were so consumed in materialism, destroying our beautiful planet’s land and species, and things didn’t seem like they were going to change anytime soon. Luckily I am here to tell you, that things did change. And also that you have changed significantly since taking a path dedicated to sustainability and mitigating the climate crisis. It took you almost 2 years but you fully adopted a plant based diet, which significantly reduced your carbon footprint and improved both your physical and mental health as well. After you graduated college you decided to live in a city so that you wouldn’t have to commute to work and could reduce your living space. Living in a city was actually so fun for you and you ended up really enjoying biking and walking to work everyday. Of course the city made it a lot easier to be environmentally friendly and nature oriented, which you needed. They installed bike paths, created more parks and rooftop gardens, and restored the idea that nature and city life can still coincide. Now in 2060, almost all transportation is either biking, walking, or public transportation like trains and buses. It’s amazing how much less traffic there is and all the city smog is gone! Throughout your time living in the city, you converted to 100% renewable energy as did much of the developed world, since the government started giving large subsidies to solar and wind energy while issuing large carbon taxes on fossil fuel extraction. It took about 12 years to fully get the government to shift away from fossil fuel interest, and a lot of that switch had to do with the massive climate activism movement in the mid 2020s. You participated a lot in this movement, joining the millions of people worldwide marching the streets. Sometimes things got violent when the government tried to control the crowds. However no matter how much the government tried to control us, we persisted. We boycotted the fracking industry, coal and oil, and demanded that more land be protected from deforestation and depletion. This movement actually brought most of our world together for the first time, because everyone was fighting for the same thing. When the Democrats took back the house, they offered aid to the developing world and offered fair wages to any outsourced material. This increase in cost also reduced the fast fashion industry and our desire to constantly want more goods. Rules and regulations were made about advertising and obsolescence to protect people from being brainwashed by large companies. However our economy is still thriving. We are the largest producer of nonrenewable energy in the world and have provided millions of jobs to those were previously low income or unemployed.  Ever since we achieved these great triumphs, the Amazon and southeast asian tropical rainforests have been recovering and are more beautiful than ever. With carbon emissions significantly lower and with the help of restoration projects, our coral reefs are rebuilding and we are experiencing less severe natural disasters as we were back when you were in college. You got married and had one daughter, because overpopulation still poses a threat to our resources. You taught her about the importance of things like going vegan, composting, using renewable energy. You explained to her how our world was being threatened with a 6th mass extinction, all caused by our own selfishness and actions. However, since our world finally recognized the change that needed to be made and did it, she will be able to have a fulfilling and safe life. So I know that right now it may seem hopeless, but if you make the changes you know you need to make and encourage others to do the same, I promise the future is amazing.

A Letter to My Future Self:

   <br><br>

2020 is when I took the class ENGL 23.  Going in I thought that I knew everything there is to know about the climate crisis. I though the class was just going to fill a gap in my schedule and fulfill one of my college requirements. I was completely wrong. Up until this point I would partake in a vegetarianism and tried to use "eco friendly" items as much as possible in my day to day life. I would organize and contribute to forms of activism that made the severity of the climate crisis heard. I thought this was enough and I had no other options to choose from to translate this message. When my friends would ask me on what ways they should adapt their lifestyle, I would recommend the things I was doing. If someone were to try and disprove that the climate crisis was not real, I would defend up until I ran out of points to make and continue to listen to their stats that were provided by fossil fuel companies such as Heartland. I would feel doubtful and question whether the stress I had added to the importance of this issue was valid, and If I should continue to support the message of change. This class has opened my eyes and fueled the fire for me to continue to want to speak up for this crisis. Thanks to this class I have the will power and the knowledge to continue my efforts in helping solve the climate crisis.

   <br><br>

This has caused me to develop goals for myself in order to reduce my carbon footprint emissions while educating others. I feel as though I have tangible proof that I can refer to during these times of doubt and can distribute to those who are interested and to those who are climate change deniers. I've learned the pain and suffering other people in "third world" countries that are not as fortunate at us are often those we harm most. I learned that we need to be considerate of what will benefit the entirety of the planet rather than a few of the most wealthy not only in a monetary position but in a societal position. I've learned to destigmatize activities such as thrift shopping, repatching worn out clothing,  and the use of public transportation. I've learned that we do not need material possessions and to keep up with fast fashion trends in order to feel happy and content with the lives we lead. We need to shift the culture that we currently lead by and set an example for the rest of the world. I know that this is the only way that can make change possible for you and the generations that are upcoming.
   <br><br>


I expect you to lead by example and continue with your activism and practicing a "green" life as much as you can. So I have written some goals for you to look back on and keep in mind as you continue through life. The first is to eat and practice a plant based lifestyle as much as you can. I know this depends a lot on the availability, but If you remember to do this it will still create a positive impact not only on the state of the climate but your health as well. If you are discouraged remember small changes are a lot better than doing no change at all. For example instead of the consumption of beef the consumption of chicken has far less impact on the Earth. The second goal I have for you is to try to depend on fossil fuels less when it comes to transportation. When available try and use public transportation. You were taught of the great benefits of deciding to use this option, so please do so. It will greatly outweigh the stigma and the comments made by other people. When you can ride your bike, and promote the utilization of public transport to others. My last goal for you is to continue to partake in activism for the climate crisis. Remember everybody does not have the privilege of having their voice heard and participate in these acts , so show up for them. Currently the 1% rules our culture and often benefit their dollar rather than the needs of the less fortunate. Use this as fuel to continue to participate and organize in these acts. Please do not let this generation fall into the same footsteps as those in the past. We do not have the luxury of time. Set up a future you and upcoming generations would be happy to live in- where the health of the planet and of humans is prioritized.

When the clock struck 12:00 last night and everyone was celebrating the start of a new decade, I started to look back on the last 40 years, and realized how grateful I am to still be here today. While I know the age of 59 is not particularly old -- when I was in college, I wasn’t quite sure what the future held for the planet, or better yet for all life that existed on it. 
   <br><br>

You see, in 2020, I decided to take a class called the Climate Crisis, where we learned about how the Earth was warming at an alarming rate and how humans’ burning of fossil fuels was the main cause. I was shocked to find out how much the CO2 in the atmosphere had risen in the last 60 years -- at that time -- and how it was put there almost entirely by Western developed countries, with the US being one of the largest culprits. Not only that, but the U.S. KNEW about climate change, they knew that the Earth was warming, they knew that it was largely because of CO2 emissions effect on the atmosphere, and they knew that our burning of fossil fuels was the main cause. They knew that this would have horrible consequences for life on Earth, but they ignored it. Like so often the case in U.S. history, the government pushed the crisis aside and took money from fossil fuel corporations like Exxon. Just when things couldn’t get any worse, Trump got elected in 2016, I know you’ve heard a lot about him and how awful he was. Well get this -- he pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord, and spread lies to the public, convincing all the republicans that climate change was a hoax! Even your own grandfather became a Trump supporter and didn’t believe any of the scientific evidence about climate change. 
   <br><br>

So you can imagine how frustrating it was to be a young person at the time, when the vast majority of Congress was republican and didn’t even believe in climate change. Not to mention how the majority of voters were also boomers like my father that didn’t know anything about climate change except what the news showed them. Anyways, as frustrating and annoying as the political climate at the time was, there was no denying the evidence. Climate change was REAL, and we were running out of time to do something about it. The goal of the Paris Accord in 2016 was to not let global temperatures rise above 1.5 degrees celsius, after which there would be HORRIBLE consequences -- like heat death, unbreathable air, and poisoned oceans. When I was taking this class in 2020, we had already reached ⅔ of that limit. At the same time, the Amazon and Australia were completely on fire, and people around the world were losing their homes due to rising sea levels -- yet THE UNITED STATES WAS STILL DOING NOTHING! 
   <br><br>

Obviously, I became really upset. But I was also scared. I was ashamed and frankly pissed off that people weren’t talking about this global emergency. I started doing everything I could to lower my personal carbon footprint; I became vegetarian, I started composting in order to reduce my food waste, I stopped buying from fast fashion companies and unnecessary items in general, and I biked or used public transportation as much as possible. But I knew this wasn’t enough, because the majority of Americans weren’t as alarmed as they needed to be. And our country was still burning fossil fuels at an unprecedented rate. 
   <br><br>

That class taught me that the only way to mitigate the crisis was through staggering systemic and cultural change. I could no longer passively stand and watch while our government ignored the issue. This part will hopefully start to sound more familiar -- I decided to join a volunteer organization on campus called EcoVista, where students collaborated on environmental initiatives to raise awareness and fight climate change at a local level. I began living more sustainably because I knew the impact it would have on my family and friends to see that it was possible to live a happy life while also minimizing your carbon footprint. In 2024, Alexandra Occasio-Cortez was elected, and we finally began to see national changes! The Green New Deal was put into effect and while many were unhappy with it, they quickly began to see that there was no other feasible option. A carbon fee was enacted and gradually people began to shift away from environmentally disastrous things like flying and driving, biking and public transportation became the primary modes of transportation in the US! People had the hardest time adapting to plant-based diets, but they knew the importance of it. Public schools began teaching about climate change and how to live sustainably in middle school, and children quickly adapted. 
   <br><br>

Even today though, the effects of previous generations’ fossil-fuel addiction is still present. You will never know the delicious taste of fresh ceviche tostadas, ever since fishing was banned in order to let the oceans recover, and that is one thing I will forever miss. But I am so blessed to still be here, and to have the privilege of knowing my kids are healthy, and that my grandkids will still be able to witness the beauty that is mother Earth. Thanks for reading through the entire ramble, I hope you keep this in mind and never forget the power of your vote. Happy new year! 
   <br><br>

With all my love,   <br><br>

Your mom

Today is the last day of 2049. I woke up unusually early this morning for the New Year celebration tomorrow, but everything else still followed my daily routine. 
    <br><br>
  Nothing is better than a short period of morning exercise for people of my age. It really keeps me refreshed for anything else in a day. Some of my friends went a step further to form a meditation group. It like it a lot, but I still prefer my own routine. 
   <br><br>
   Speaking of my friends, Florence is working in a pharmaceutical company with Mike. They have been doing research for decades and they have made many significant breakthroughs. They have gotten pretty famous not only because of their work, but also their work ethics. The price of medicine has gotten quite low compared to before. I am still feeling healthy today thanks to them I am telling ya! 
   <br><br>
  Watson and Jennifer are working in a marine lab in the west coast in CA. They are dealing with endangered species living in the ocean for quite sometime. Millions of tons of oil spills and waste dumped into the ocean are finally getting cleaned up after waiting all these years for a complete ban of fracking. You know, fracking was still a thing just 30 years ago, and it added more and more oil spill into the ocean, but seeing them gone is such a relief. One of my friends Jack was working in one of those oil drills and he actually prayed that he could get a different job because how dangerous the work is. He is now managing a workshop with his colleagues for making mechanical parts in a community.
   <br><br>
  Kevin is working as an engineer with me on some more public projects. This time we have to scale down some of the freeways in a nearby city. Most cities now only have one car lane, one bus lane and two bike lanes now. The roads are re-designed for the safety of pedestrians and bikers. The car lane is always a carpool lane now, and people who drive alone is going to get fined. Coincidentally, Watson and Jennifer are gonna drive to meet us this new year through a recently modified car(pool) lane. Although we have always been talking through online apps, it feels more genuine when we meet in-person.
   <br><br>
   Speaking of my job, I still remember that I was such a stoic worker before. It was a boring corporate job. The sky was gloomy and pessimistic, and I always stared at the window until my boss snapped me out of it. This irregular working schedule disrupted my life, I couldn’t manage my life as I can now. Luckily my community is among the first communities that change its system. That is how I know all of these amazing friends. I am still working as a civil engineer with Kevin for these communities around this area, and I know my job is to make it look as eco-friendly as possible so no one else has to go through a depressive environment ever again.
   <br><br>

   Kind of getting too far into my past there. Anyways I went over the list of groceries that I have to get for tomorrow, just to make sure that I didn’t forget anything. I bought some nice protein supplements, which are made from insect farms. You can’t imagine how big is this insect business. Almost every community across the country has a little insect farm. Chickens are the second biggest farming business right after the insect farming. Cows, lambs are getting scarce (although I could still buy them in the market today because a holiday is coming up). I also bought a bunch of vegetables, mushrooms, and fruits. A friend of mine taught me all sorts of ways to cook these “boring” vegetables. I know I hated eating them, but wow his cooking skill is way over the top. Some veggie recipes have gotten trendy recently and consequently vegetables got really popular. This year I wanna try something different because my friends suggest me a new recipe and I am looking forward to trying it out tomorrow.
   <br><br>

   Everything has become so convenient now, everything is within walking distance. I bought all the groceries, settled them down, said hi to my neighbors, and I went to teach the kids about physics and astronomy. It was a busy day but the air is fresh; the sky is clear; the streets are clean. No more fancy products in the market now. Snacks, candies are all sorted in a big jar. No more plastic bags, no more plastic bottles, no more one-time use items. Water directly goes to every household instead of having the need to buy water bottles. There are recycling factories that recycle current trash as much as possible. The recycling line is still endless, but at least we have reduced the input of trash. 
   <br><br>

   For some reasons my experience today made me think about the past. Today’s entry is weird I agree, but I feel happy that these changes are made before everything goes completely downhill. This sense of stress from decades ago is still in me, but this recall from the past made me relax a little. It feels nice to be able to sleep well again. 

   <br><br>
   Can’t wait for tomorrow!

To my future children/family and friends:

   <br><br>

I am nearing the end of the journey of life. I have been reminiscing lately of all the good times I had, but also the troublesome times. Let's throw it back to the year 2020. It was the start of a new decade, something that many people were looking forward to- but it had a really rough start. Kobe passed along with his daughter, so did Pop Smoke, and the coronavirus pandemic was affecting daily life in practically every part of the world. There was another issue that has been picking up a lot of momentum in terms of possible destruction- the climate crisis.
   <br><br>


Many people were increasing their carbon footprint, constantly traveling by plane, continuing deforestation. It was a horrible time for the environment. However, using the power of democracy, we voted the politicians who supported fracking and such out of office in the election of that year. The Green New Deal wasn't passed until 2024, however, but despite it being passed until a couple years later, improvements were made almost immediately. By 2030, many companies were running on renewable energy. By 2040, bikes were the main form of transportation in the cities due to the change of infrastructure of the streets. People reduced their meat consumption, and carbon tax laws were implemented and reinforced more heavily than before. Like Future said in 2020, "Life is good."
   <br><br>


The US started to reduce their carbon footprint by more than half per individual, and were starting to help other countries in providing renewable energy, safe work places (which meant the removal of bad sweatshops), and a good economic support system. How did all of these started to happen? Voting. Something that my freshman college professor constantly vouched for. A quote that I still remember is that "Knowledge is power squandered unless acted upon." Real talk.

   <br><br>

Because we were able to act and make actual changes in legislation, the environment started to improve. We made the world a more healthier place for you. It was a long battle, always protesting, marching, pushing for laws to be passed, many tough elections, but we pulled through.


</p><hr>


<p>
After watching the video for this week, I have this interesting mix of emotions in my chest and I could not exactly pinpoint which emotions I am feeling the strongest. I feel sad and disappointed in the inaction of the majority of people on this planet facing climate change; I feel extremely worried and even a bit pessimistic towards the future for humanity and the planet as it is likely that massive destruction will dawn upon us due to the negative consequences of climate change and the end of the world seems to be approaching us at a pace faster than I anticipated; but interestingly at the same time I also feel this sense of hope and optimism towards our future because maybe sometimes in the future we will realize the urgency and the pressing nature of our situation and to take actions to address this issue before everything is too late, and the new generation--Generation Z or people around my age--is more aware of the environmental changes and hopefully will make sweeping changes in our socio-political scenes with laws and policies to mitigate the climate crisis. 
   <br><br>


Furthermore, I want to express my gratitude for Professor Ken and ENGL 23 and just how much useful knowledge and information this course has introduced me to and which I had never thought that I would be learning in this course. This course really showed me how much I do not know about our environment and the issue of climate change, and even at this point after taking this course for the quarter, I know that there is still so much I do not know about climate change and climate change, but this course gives me the motivation and the ways and mean to learn and teach myself more on the topic. ENGL 23 really opened my mind to a new field of knowledge which to be perfectly honest, I never expected from a GE class. This course is truly life-changing and I would not doubt if this class is made mandatory for every UCSB student to take because it addresses topics regarding climate change that are very relevant and impactful in our lives since climate change is a global issue affecting all lives on the planet. ENGL 23 offers a perfect beginning for me and many other fellow students to see the ways we live and inhabit this planet and to gradually incorporate changes into our daily lives in order to save ourselves and the planet. I am also gaining interest in environmental activism which I was introduced to in this course, and I cannot wait to learn more about it and what I can do to contribute to the overall cause of climate change alleviation through activism even though I have never participated in any activist activities before. Nevertheless, the interest is there and I believe I will participate in more in the future. 
   <br><br>


Lastly, I want to end my comment with a letter from my future self regarding climate change and what people did about it in the future in 40 years. I want to emphasize that my letter will have a positive optimistic undertone to it because I believe that necessary actions will be taken and that we should not give up hope since we still have time left to address it before it is too late. 

   <br><br>

Dear Me, 

   <br><br>

This is the future me writing from the year 2060, and I want to talk to you about the issue of climate change and what we all did to alleviate it. First of all, I want to tell you the good news that climate change is under control thanks to the immediate drastic and necessary actions taken by the governments under the leadership of the rising, young, ambitious, and optimistic Gen Z leaders, or people from our generation. Starting from the year 2040 with the new Gen Z leaders and officials takeover of Congress and the U.S. government, the Green New Deal proposed two decades ago had officially become the center of the government attention and the entire Congress and the government were shifting their focus immediately to the Green New Deal and the issue of climate change. Congress was actively proposing and passing relevant laws and policies following the goal of the Green New Deal, such as the carbon-free act that placed restrictions on the amount of carbon dioxide the animal agriculture and fossil fuel industries were allowed to emit per year. 
   <br><br>


The industries were required to monitor their carbon emission every month and submit the reports to the government, and if they ever exceeded the allowed amount of carbon emission or that they fabricated parts of the report, then the companies would be subjected to huge fines and jail sentences. There was also a carbon tax passed to tax consumers when they pump gas into their automobiles as fuels in order to reduce fossil fuel consumption by taxing the fuels and raising gas prices. Besides the carbon tax, the government provided federal grants and subsidies to researches conducted on renewable energy sources such as wind, water, solar, and geothermal, and the research organizations and institutions for those renewable sources would need to report their progress to the government as well to prevent misuse of the subsidies and funds. Bike lanes were built and put into use in every city in the country now that a majority of people bike to work and school due to the rising gas price and the pollution released from the automobiles. The restaurants and supermarkets have established their freegan management system that rather than throwing away and disposing of a large amount of food that the customers did not purchase or eat into the landfills, the restaurants and supermarkets will send these food to their local freegan organization branch. The freegan branch will sort out and repackage the food that is being wasted but in good-conditions and send them back to the supermarkets and restaurants. Citizens are encouraged to buy freegan-packaged food because freegan food tends to be much cheaper, and citizens can win prizes for collecting the freegan labels on the freegan-packaged foods. The TV and social media commercials starring top celebrities are all advocating for eating a freegan and a largely plant-based diet because these diets are healthy and beneficial to our environment. Basically everyone-both the citizens and celebrities- is eating freegan or a largely plant-based diet. In terms of housing, cohousing and micro apartments are becoming more and more popular as more people move to the major cities. Studies and researches have also shown that people living in cohousing communities and more space-efficient micro-apartments tend to be happier than those living in huge houses due to their closer connections to their neighbors and others in the community. The larger houses are subjected to higher land tax and property tax too, so cohousing and micro-apartments are the way to go these days. 
   <br><br>


Lastly, I want to tell you what happened to the fast fashion industry. It is still there--I know, we both expected to be gone for the good of our environment--but the fashion industries are making changes and adaptations to adjust the Green New Deal implementations in the society. There are fewer seasons of clothing now--not 52 seasons a year thank God--but rather 4 seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. There are several stores that have slightly more seasons than our regular seasonal cycles, but under the laws of the Green New Deal, they are not allowed to have more than 10 seasons a year of new clothes otherwise they will face fines and jail sentences as well. 
   <br><br>
I’m sorry I cannot include everything in this letter due to the limitations of the space provided, but I do want to let you know and assure you that good things are happening and we are on the right track to tackle climate change. And I am seeing the progress we are making and I could not be more happy that we took action when we could. Do not lose hope and never give up, XOXO

   <br><br>

Sincerely, 

   <br><br>

Future Me

A message from my future self:
   <br><br>

It’s 2060 now, but by the time you are reading this, you’re still a sophomore in college during the year 2020. Though you have always been reluctant to overhaul the way you live due to uncertainty and feeling like your actions won’t make a change, English 23 has opened up a row of new doors for you. You’ve taken Ken’s lists of both personal and collective actions and have applied most of them to your life. For example, you decided to continue living in shared spaces once you got out of college. It started at smaller apartment complexes found in the city, but as you got older and decided to start a family, you moved into a co-housing community. You strictly take public transportation now - it’s improved in the years between 2020 and 2060, anyways; we finally pushed for funding to create a high speed rail system, and public transportation throughout cities is now free for all to use in order to encourage greener travel.
   <br><br>

I know that you constantly felt hopeless about the climate issue when you were younger, but trust me, that has changed as well. After taking English 23 and a few more classes on environmental issues, you found the confidence to become more active with your peers in pressuring the government to change the way that things were. Through voting, petitioning, and being an environmental activist, we were able to fight for the things that we believed in. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn’t. If it didn’t work, however, we just increased the pressure - the younger generations were on our minds the whole time. 
   <br><br>

Not only that, but you became an environmental writer, just like you’d wanted to. You wrote for a  bunch of different topics in order to draw attention to the crisis. You wrote about environmental policies, environmental justice, and how everyone could help with mitigating the climate crisis. Just as you had been educated years before, you wanted your writings to educate others and convince them to fight for their future as you had been doing. 
   <br><br>

If we hadn’t stepped up when we did, I can honestly say I don’t think I would be here writing to you right now. Our planet could have crumbled around us as a result of our actions - but it didn’t. Our generation is now around the same age that Ken’s was when I first took that class at UCSB. We won’t repeat the same mistakes as they did, however. Not when we’ve made so much progress.
   <br><br>

Sincerely,
   <br><br>

You, 40 years from now




</p><hr>


<p>
Wow, I cannot really believe everything that we have been through in the past 40 years. Life has really taken so many twists and turns and I really feel like the best and worst times of our lives have occurred throughout that time. It took a really long time for a lot of people to accept the climate crisis as reality as opposed to a myth. Bernie won in the 2020 presidential election and initiated the Green New Deal, half the country begrudgingly accepted the new changes and saw the light of their mistakes. We were able to make true change, replacing fossil fuel based jobs with energy efficient and banned fracking. The government mandated a lot of new changes present and though there were a lot of complaints and misery because of the banning of cars, there was still so much positively affected that people could not see. After the government improved the public transportation: buses, trains, and the invention of the super train. I know it is hard to think of a time in which people used cars and only for ONE person, but it used to happen a lot back then and despite resistance, a lot of transportation time was decreased. From my house to downtown LA, it took an hour with traffic instead of the 15 minutes it takes now. Thats crazy, i know but everything was so different back then. 
   <br><br>

In 2023 disaster happened, despite our change there was still some of the backlash that the Earth had, honestly it deserved to be that angry after everything we had done to it. There was an earthquake in all regions of the west coast and caused billions in damage. So we scrambled to help and save people, millions of lives were in peril and some did die. We were able to start slowly repairing that damage and when rebuilding we used more environmentally stable housing like micro apartments. We also cut back on a lot of fast fashion, which was fast and cheap production of clothes. People used to buy so much clothes back then and people had these things called walk in closets- a closet that resembled a room. Truthfully you will have difficulty imagining the extent of American consumerist ways. The government stopped relying on others countries that encouraged poor labor laws and so American production of clothes boomed and now we make all of our things here. Thinking back on life that we lived back then in 2020 seems too bizarre, we truly had so many people caring about themselves as opposed to the environment. 
   <br><br>

Also to further expand on mindblowing matters we used to have real planes, you know the ones in the older movies. But the truth is that flying was so important to 1/20 of the population and that people used it for everything. After the great pandemic of the CoronaVirus, airline companies really decreased and eventually our government also mandated a no fly policy. This is when the supertrain was invented, essentially it is a bullet train that allowed us to travel at the same rate as airplanes. As for international travel the invention of the Bubble was made, allowing us to essentially get into a large Bubble contraption that fits comfortably fits 300 and that moves via water at the same rate as a plane. This really did help us and though you may think “Wow why did the government need to intervene to make people really see what was happening to the world?” Because people hate change, especially when it affects them. But change is necessary and we must put the comfort of ourselves behind the greater good. Now we have a great life, and a healthier planet because of technological inventions. Oh and we managed to save the polar ice caps!!!! Anyways, I hope you enjoy the great changes that were made to make us thrive.

A letter to my future self:
   <br><br>


The year is 2020. I am sitting at home in my room, away from school due to the coronavirus, and my finals have been canceled. This is my last assignment for Winter quarter 2020 of my freshman year. This winter quarter, I chose to take this class, English 23: the Climate Crisis after taking English 22 and wanting to dive deeper into the climate crisis and what I can do about it. 

   <br><br>

I have learned many things, and a lot of solutions to help the climate crisis I have already implemented into my life to not only help the climate, but become a happier person myself. Firstly, I have switched to a nearly all vegan and plant-based diet that has not only made me healthier and help mitigate the mistreatment of animals, but also decrease my climate footprint and slow the terrible footprint that the animal agricultural industry has. I choose to eat organic and create less waste, as well as composting where and when I can. I have decreased my consumption of "stuff," and started to live a more minimalist lifestyle, where I use things and love people, not the other way around. I am mindful of what I buy and its ecological footprint, not looking for happiness in material gain, where it cannot be found. This past presidential primary, I voted at the polls to help elect more environmentally-friendly candidates that will help implement policies that will help mitigate the climate crisis and place the earth's health before corporate and greed-driven interests.

   <br><br>

As I am reading this letter to myself 20, 30, or even 40 years in the future I hope that I will have continued to implement more practices in my life to help mitigate the climate crisis and to live in harmony with nature. I hope that I have gotten further involved in climate activism and helped to make a beautiful, and eco-friendly change in my community that is socially just and helps people of all backgrounds with no discrimination. I hope to see greener cities and areas. I hope I am living in a small or tiny house in a location with a great community and access to nature, where I can appreciate what Mother Earth does for all of us and the blessings she gives. I am so thankful for the world I live in and the countless blessings I experience. In the future, I am growing a lot of my own food in a way that increases diversity of the environment, where many different species of animals and plants thrive. I buy organically and locally to help build the environment around me.

   <br><br>

I know that it may be hard for me, as I love to surf around different spots and explore the world, but I hope that I have given up the use of a car and that I use an electric bike to get around everywhere I need to. I hope that I have given up flying but found other amazing ways of traveling and discovering the world. 

   <br><br>

I hope I continue to stay educated on topics like the climate crisis that majorly affect our world and have great implications. I am aware of the best things to do and I practice them. Most importantly, I hope I am a loving, accepting, open-minded human being that puts other beings before himself and serves to create an amazing, peaceful, and happy Earth. I am so thankful for all of the blessings I have and opportunities like taking English 23 that expand my perspective and show me how to help the world. I hope that my generation was the one to truly and radically change the world to not only mitigate the climate crisis and mend our bond with nature, but to create more harmony, peace and love among human beings - creating a New Earth, not one centered on greed and consumption, but one centered on peace and joy.

I’m now around 60 years old. It pains me to say. My life is really just a blur, everything happened so fast. One decade led on to the next until we couldn’t really count decades anymore. Everything started in 2020 after I took a climate change class at UC Santa Barbara. I knew we were headed towards the unexpected. Or rather, what we expected. It just turned out to be far worse than we could have ever imagined.
    <br><br>

It started with a virus breakout. Labeled Covid-19 and originating in China, the virus spread internationally in a matter of months, causing world-wide panic. Within April, stores in the United States ran out of pasta, canned foods, and rice. Although not particularly deadly, the infectious nature of the disease caused many people to reconsider travel. During that time period, flights were very limited and everyone mostly stayed at home to prevent its spread. Our global emissions dropped from 38.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to only 10.9 billion. Thankfully, research teams held their heads high and a vaccine was eventually developed in March of next year. Within September of next year, the vaccine was available worldwide in great quantities and people’s fears gradually dwindled. However bad the panic might have been, it was good in some way. Global emissions dropped significantly and allowed organisms and plants to recover from ecosystems being destroyed by human expansion. The beef industry was practically completely halted and fracking was reduced by 85 percent. 
    <br><br>

Numerous global scientists urged fracking, gasoline, and airline companies to slow down their production after the virus had been eliminated. They believed it was a clever way to bring down global emissions after people were habituated to not traveling and consuming. However, they failed to listen. In 2023, global carbon dioxide emissions skyrocketed to 53.2 billion metric tons. By 2025, the number jumped to 65.4 billion tons. In 2035, there was a worldwide panic due to the ocean rises. Bangladesh found 35 percent of its landmass under the ocean. Millions of people were left homeless off the coasts of places such as Florida. Miami became practically completely submerged. Global temperatures had now risen an average of 4.6 degrees celsius worldwide. The ice caps were basically non-existent. Shortly after in 2037, there was a huge gas shortage worldwide except for the Middle East. Eventually, the Middle East became one of the only geographical areas still containing enormous amounts of fossil fuels and they halted all trade due to the shortage. On May 7th, 2039, a huge power struggle over fossil fuel trade occurred between Russia, the Middle East (neighboring countries banned together), and the U.S., starting world war III. On October 7th, 2041, tensions rose tremendously when the Middle East threatened to kill 20,000 prisoners if the United States and Russia did not stop their relentless quest for oil. The United States took a step back but Russia decided to attack soon after. In retaliation, the Middle East held true to their promise and started to eliminate their prisoners. In order to prevent further killings, the United States threatened nuclear warfare if more prisoners were killed. The Middle East refused and the United States dropped a nuclear bomb nicknamed “Deliverance” on Iran. In retaliation, Iran fired all of its nuclear arsenals on the United States before suffering a catastrophic fate. The United States consequently sent even more bombs before also enduring one of the most catastrophic events witnessed in the history of mankind.
    <br><br>

I was lucky, I went back to France in 2036 to live in a small town about 2 hours south of Paris with my wife. Having somewhat predicted the horrible consequences of anthropomorphic climate change (and of human action as a result), we were more ready than others for the disasters that followed. We had a friend in Switzerland who worked for the government and secured some spots for us in one of their underground nuclear bunkers. We remained there for 5 years, waiting for the radiation to die down before we attempted to rebuild civilization. Things are much different now. Arguably maybe, even better than before. Despite the enormous amount of casualties during the nuclear war, times are better now. Plants and animals alike, are roaming the Earth in places where they once could never venture. The temperature has started to stabilize with much less carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. As we started to rebuild civilization I remembered the climate class I took back in 2020 with Ken Hiltner. Even though the course was an eternity ago, I still remembered some of the fundamental aspects of living a sustainable lifestyle. As such, we started a new life. We do not waste our food and even compost when we eat vegetables and fruits. We rarely eat meat and instead grow crops such as corn and wheat and nuts in order to sustain ourselves. Instead of using cars (although, at this point, there wasn’t really much point) we bike to locations we need to go to every day. On top of reducing emissions, cycling provided everyone with a great opportunity to lose weight and become more fit. 
    <br><br>

What’s crazy to me is all of this could have been avoided. Had we rationed and lowered our carbon footprints worldwide. Had we maybe been less selfish. Had the quest for fossil fuels not been so essential to powering our industries. We wouldn’t have had to go to such extremes for gasoline when such a sustainable lifestyle is one hundred percent achievable. Believe me, even at 60, I am proud to live this lifestyle. It is much more simplistic, I feel fulfilled and happy to be living in coexistence with the environment. It’s like that one author I read some time ago, Thoreau. I’ve got to say, I was never too attached to my personal belongings in the first place. However, achieving a minimalist lifestyle now seems so much more reasonable and healthy for everyone in our community. Despite our lack of technology, we are still surprisingly optimistic. Some people even claim to like this life more than the blue-collar job they went to 50 hours a week before the war. 
    <br><br>

In all honesty, It feels quite extraordinary to be in such a situation. Growing up in a technological world only to be reduced to the bare minimum for survival. But...I kind of like it. We provide for one another and all contributions in society are seen as valuable. Sometimes I reminisce on the past, what could have done. If consumerism wasn’t so central to our agency. Could it have been different? Is it human destiny to self-destruct out of greed and thirst for power?  I’m glad all this selfishness is gone. Although... I’ll admit it, a good old scroll through social media would be a great way to kill time once in a while.

I’m now around 60 years old. It pains me to say. My life is really just a blur, everything happened so fast. One decade led on to the next until we couldn’t really count decades anymore. Everything started in 2020 after I took a climate change class at UC Santa Barbara. I knew we were headed towards the unexpected. Or rather, what we expected. It just turned out to be far worse than we could have ever imagined.
     <br><br>

It started with a virus breakout. Labeled Covid-19 and originating in China, the virus spread internationally in a matter of months, causing world-wide panic. Within April, stores in the United States ran out of pasta, canned foods, and rice. Although not particularly deadly, the infectious nature of the disease caused many people to reconsider travel. During that time period, flights were very limited and everyone mostly stayed at home to prevent its spread. Our global emissions dropped from 38.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to only 10.9 billion. Thankfully, research teams held their heads high and a vaccine was eventually developed in March of next year. Within September of next year, the vaccine was available worldwide in great quantities and people’s fears gradually dwindled. However bad the panic might have been, it was good in some way. Global emissions dropped significantly and allowed organisms and plants to recover from ecosystems being destroyed by human expansion. The beef industry was practically completely halted and fracking was reduced by 85 percent. 
     <br><br>

Numerous global scientists urged fracking, gasoline, and airline companies to slow down their production after the virus had been eliminated. They believed it was a clever way to bring down global emissions after people were habituated to not traveling and consuming. However, they failed to listen. In 2023, global carbon dioxide emissions skyrocketed to 53.2 billion metric tons. By 2025, the number jumped to 65.4 billion tons. In 2035, there was a worldwide panic due to the ocean rises. Bangladesh found 35 percent of its landmass under the ocean. Millions of people were left homeless off the coasts of places such as Florida. Miami became practically completely submerged. Global temperatures had now risen an average of 4.6 degrees celsius worldwide. The ice caps were basically non-existent. Shortly after in 2037, there was a huge gas shortage worldwide except for the Middle East. Eventually, the Middle East became one of the only geographical areas still containing enormous amounts of fossil fuels and they halted all trade due to the shortage. On May 7th, 2039, a huge power struggle over fossil fuel trade occurred between Russia, the Middle East (neighboring countries banned together), and the U.S., starting world war III. On October 7th, 2041, tensions rose tremendously when the Middle East threatened to kill 20,000 prisoners if the United States and Russia did not stop their relentless quest for oil. The United States took a step back but Russia decided to attack soon after. In retaliation, the Middle East held true to their promise and started to eliminate their prisoners. In order to prevent further killings, the United States threatened nuclear warfare if more prisoners were killed. The Middle East refused and the United States dropped a nuclear bomb nicknamed “Deliverance” on Iran. In retaliation, Iran fired all of its nuclear arsenals on the United States before suffering a catastrophic fate. The United States consequently sent even more bombs before also enduring one of the most catastrophic events witnessed in the history of mankind.
     <br><br>

I was lucky, I went back to France in 2036 to live in a small town about 2 hours south of Paris with my wife. Having somewhat predicted the horrible consequences of anthropomorphic climate change (and of human action as a result), we were more ready than others for the disasters that followed. We had a friend in Switzerland who worked for the government and secured some spots for us in one of their underground nuclear bunkers. We remained there for 5 years, waiting for the radiation to die down before we attempted to rebuild civilization. Things are much different now. Arguably maybe, even better than before. Despite the enormous amount of casualties during the nuclear war, times are better now. Plants and animals alike, are roaming the Earth in places where they once could never venture.

Hi kiddos,
     <br><br>

This is your mom! You’re probably reading this sometime around 2060, and I sincerely hope the world has changed for the better! When I was 19 the future of our planet as I knew it, sadly, was a big source of stress for me and most of my peers. We treated our Earth very badly and it brought us to a horrible place in global history. Global heat was rising to unsafe levels, the ocean was acidifying, there were larger and more intense fires around the world. We were exploiting resources from our planet and not allowing them to regenerate naturally. We were acting with greed and ignoring the tremendously detrimental effects that our actions were having on underdeveloped nations, wildlife, and the future of our planet: you guys. In March of 2020, after taking a climate change class my sophomore year of college, I felt scared. America was hugely contributing to global carbon emissions. Our country was controlled by the wealthy, and they were promoting agricultural and business practices that maximized their profit. I didn’t know how I could tackle the climate crisis but I knew I had to if I wanted to have kids and the future I always imagined. 
     <br><br>

In November of that same year, everything changed. Student movements across the country played a huge role in bringing as many young voters to the polls as possible. Bernie Sanders was elected president and the far-right movement that had controlled our country for so long was finally over. It was the age of the Green New Deal. Budding architects and city planners around the country designed extensive public transportation systems to decrease our car use. Americans were limited to one car per family. Healthcare became publicly funded, and our access to contraceptives was better than ever before. Americans were having less unwanted pregnancies, dramatically reducing our carbon footprint. Economic controls were put in place to decrease the power of the billionaire class at the expense of normal citizens, thereby decreasing the influence of capitalism in our country. To me, this cultural shift was the most profound to witness. I saw more people shopping at thrift stores and practicing urban farming. More people were purchasing locally sourced goods and many of my friends shifted away from a meat-heavy diet. Throughout all this cultural change I noticed something incredible: people became happier. About a decade later, in 2032, a global study was conducted to see which countries were the “happiest.” Previously, America had been ranked number 19. In 2032 though, after our immense cultural shift and commitment to a greener future, we jumped to number 11. 
     <br><br>

Of course, we didn’t reverse all the damage. Miami, a city you never got a chance to see, was flooded. There were extreme fires worldwide that devastated families and wildlife. We couldn’t completely stop big agriculture in such a short amount of time and more land was destroyed by them. But to think of what would have happened if we had not made the changes we did is horrifying. As of when I’m writing this, we have no proof that there is any other conscious life (by our definition) in our entire universe. And here we are, with this incredible earth, this incredible life. We get to swim in the ocean and look up at the stars and smell wildflowers and share the world with amazing creatures. We get to scuba dive and hike and camp and look up at trees that are hundreds of years old. And we get to consciously and wholly appreciate all of it. So appreciate it. We are unfathomably lucky. We only have one home, and we have to continue to take care of it. After all, I would hate for future generations to experience the fear we did in 2020.
     <br><br>

I love you guys.
     <br><br>

Mom


</p><hr>


<p>

Dear me,
     <br><br>


Remember when the UN announced that we have until 2050 until the earth has undergone irreversible environmental damage? Well we barely made it. I am now 51 years old, father of 2. I wanted three kids, maybe four, but there were too few resources here on earth at the time, so we had to settle. This takes me back when I was a kid myself, in college, taking Eng23 with Ken Hiltner. He talked about all the things we could do a help deter the climate crisis. Many of us understood the seriousness of it all, some us actually employed the tactics he presented to us, a lot of people ignored these warnings. But what of those who never took a course like this? Well as you could imagine, they did nothing. People will be people, and sadly many of them were still in the pursuit of capital gain and financial assets, looking for happiness in places were it does not exist. I never knew why people could not stop living like this... was it due to the politicians and their neglectful policies, did they have no other choice in this economy but to endlessly pursue money, was it because they simply did not care? At your current time, soon, if not already, the world will arrive at a crisis in which the earth will no longer be able to sustain the human population that overruns it. We drove ourselves into this hole as a result of greed and selfishness. People, myself included, wanted the newest clothes, the biggest house, a lucrative job, but what did the cost us? Our home. Greta Thornburg was right. Ken Hiltner was right. Some listened, but not enough. But often times with people, it takes a direct and tangible effect in order for people to rise to action. Once it became evident that we were spiraling towards complete environmental destruction, only then did the masses act. 
     <br><br>


It was 2024 when we finally elected politicians who truly cared for the earth, and they showed this through policy that challenged our individualistic way of life.

     <br><br>

It was 2029 when I sold my car and decided to rely on my own two feet, my bike, and public transportation. Family and friends called me crazy, but soon after they followed suit, realizing that if no change occurs, there will no longer be roads to drive on.
     <br><br>


It was 2032 when I first tried co-housing. This was difficult as I value my space, but my housemates became some of my closest friends. I also figured out just how much nonsense I actually owned. This was a new feeling of contentment that an infinite amount of space could never bring me. This was the minimalist lifestyle that Ken was talking about. If only I came to know the beauty of it sooner.

     <br><br>

Fast forward again. It was 2037 when I adopted vegetarianism. This of all things, was the hardest transition for me. Burgers, steaks, chicken of all renditions, gone. I failed the first number of times, but now it is a lifestyle. I have never felt healthier. My fiance compliments me not only on my body and health, but on my fantastic culinary skills too. I never knew the alternatives in creating a balanced dish without meat. It is truly an art. 
     <br><br>


It was 2045. The population crisis has been mitigated due to years of increased education. Remember when I said we elected people who cared about the environment? Education is a big part of that too. With more funding for schools and much lower school fees, our public is smarter. Denier rhetoric is seen through with so much ease that no one is old-school enough to try that. They still have their tactics, though most of them futile. Men do not try to push policies on whether abortion should be allowed; they finally figured out it is not their bodies, so they finally shut up. 
     <br><br>


I guess it took some true fear to push people in the right direction, but at least we learned from our mistakes. Kids are now being taught about the environment on the same level that they are taught about math and science, so we are in good hands. Ken asked if we were the generation that could fix the overwhelming problem that threatened our existence. I'm glad to say that I was a part of it.

     <br><br>

It is now 2050. The Earth is good. Life is good.



</p><hr>


<p>
A letter from the future:
     <br><br>

The year is 2060. Honestly, I would not have been able to predict our current living situations had you asked me about them 40 years ago. 2020 was by far one of the most disastrous years of my life. Others who lived through this time would very likely agree with me on this.
     <br><br>

Although there were multiple events during this year that contributed to it being known as so disastrous, including a deadly virus that was rapidly spreading across the globe, the biggest crisis we were dealing with was the climate crisis. The global temperature of the world was increasing due to many things we were doing wrong, but most generally due to the burning of fossil fuels. The problem with this situation was that a lot of people weren't even realizing the severity of it all, including myself. It wasn’t until the beginning of 2020 when I took a random english class in college that I had no idea would end up being so important to me.
     <br><br>

The class was called the climate crisis, and the professor, Ken Hiltner taught an immense amount of knowledge on the situation and how it could be changed. As I was learning more and more about the climate crisis we were facing, I took many steps to changing many aspects of my lifestyle choices in hopes of improving the situation. Although I knew I was doing what I could to help the situation, I really wasn’t very optimistic that things were going to change anytime soon. Following within the next couple of months, however, came the 2020 election where Bernie Sanders was elected for president, and everything slowly changed for the better from there.
     <br><br>

Having someone as our president understand the severity of climate change, it really did change many of the views people had on it, especially for those who didn’t see it as something to be concerned about. The situation has improved immensely since this time. I made the mistake of having a pessimistic attitude toward the situation, when clearly, the future was bright.




</p><hr>


<p>

A message from the future: 
     <br><br>

 Hey there! When you are reading this, it might be somewhere around 2060. You may consider why the earth has become what it looks like in the picture and why I am living a minimalist life now. It all goes back to the winter of 2020 when I took my first course about the climate crisis at UCSB,  and it was the first time I was actually aware of the serious damages that human development had taken on the earth. At that time, many people had already realized a great deal of disasters like Australian wildfires, South Asia floods, East Africa drought were all directly caused by the climate change, and they urged for climate actions. The individual actions that might help mitigating included having a plant based diet, taking public and slow transportation, buying less and living a minimalist life (like what I am doing now) and so on. A lot of people were doing these at that time, but most people gave no reaction and did nothing about it. Some government officials held doubts on the real happening climate crisis, and some fossil fuel companies often used improper educational ways to arouse people’s doubts about this for their own benefits. Although many people especially the younger generation also took collective actions like voting to try to take new control of the power, success took ten years to arrive because of lack of momentum. 
     <br><br>

 In 2040, the government has finally realized that the climate activists were right in the past decades and has started taking change globally. However, since the planet has already taken too much damage, humans needed to take more big, significant steps to reverse what we have done. The burning of fossil fuel was completely banned and all fossil fuel companies were closed. Mass producing cows were greatly limited in order to reduce the released methane into the atmosphere. Vegan restaurants became more and more prevalent, and most people have moved into big cities, living in small-space apartments there. Electric bikes, faster eco-friendly buses, subways, and trains took over car travels. The accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began to fall sharply, and climate-change-caused natural disasters started to happen less frequently. People were beginning to see the dawn of the earth’s rebirth. Meanwhile, the Green New Deal has been implemented after some new changes being made. Everything was working toward the better.
     <br><br>

 Now in 2060, although many extinct creatures and the loss of some ecological environments are unable to remedy, the human race has become united and worked toward the same goal by living a minimalist and most eco-friendly life. It would still take some time for the earth to fully recover, and we need to teach the next generation about the horrific past so as not to repeat an almost irreparable tragedy.



</p><hr>


<p>

40 years I was in my very first year of college. I was a taking a course that gave me almost a look into what the world was going to encounter in the years leading up until today. This was class was also in the exact time that the country was facing the COVID-19 pandemic. As we all know that we got through this and are now vaccinated for the disease. This was a stressful time in the world and in the country. We were no only battling this pandemic but also a crash in the market a huge change to the world norms all with an incompetent presidential administration. However, later that year the democratic party took back power and we started to move forward.Vaccines were easy ton get and treatment was easy to get with the new healthcare  plans adopted. Once the pandemic was handled we COVID we continued our nations progress.
     <br><br>

 My personal favorite is our new modes of transportation we began to bike and adopt slow travel. Cars are now almost frowned upon. Although we have had technological advancements like high speed rails bike have taken over as the easiest and most popular mode of transportation. So, many have adopted biking. Now with the new bike lanes developed that closely resemble those in Copenhagen 70% of our population choses bike. This has also helped the nations health along with our new diets (which i will get into soon), obesity has been lessened astronomically.  High speed rails although not as popular as bikes have alps curved our use of both cars and airplanes. They have allowed for a faster option of slow travel if that makes sense. We are allowed to have a faster type of travel, still not as fast as a plane, but it is faster than a bus or a normal train.  Not only this but we as country have also shifted on beef production as we no longer are a heavy consumer in livestock products. We now live off a mainly plant based diet. All of our changes hurt the fossil fuels guzzling companies pretty badly.  The economy was hurt for a very small period of time until our new green companies took over. This new change affected the country like FDR’s New Deal but at a much bigger scale. There are actually more jobs and the economy is in best shape it has ever been. 
     <br><br>

 It is amazing to look back at how my time at UCSB began and now looking as I am 58 and how far we have came. I went to petrified of my future, and all those who hadn’t even been born yet futures. Yet, we are now prospering. The clouds have cleared and we there now we are in the best global shape we have been in.



</p><hr>


<p>

Wow... the year 2020, what a time. I finally left the nest, venturing out into the real world to begin my studies at UCSB. The world was in dismay. Politics were an absolute mess. The right hated the left and the left hated the right, forgetting about the common good. If I remember correctly, it was the year Coronavirus swept the world, causing huge portions of society to be put on lockdown. I remember seeing the countries of the world come together, preventing the virus fulfilling its full potential. I remember the hope I felt seeing the world come together, but was confused as to why the government's of the world, specifically my own, the United States, were turning a blind eye to the other global threat that was increasingly evident, the climate crisis. It wasn't until decades later when true change began happening. I remember the chaos on campus, which erupted when President Biden denounced the Green New Deal, describing its unachievable ideals. Many years later, we witnessed AOC run for president, reviving the once forgotten Green New Deal. Its popularity soared as many stubborn climate deniers began to witness first hand the destruction our new climate was causing as Hurricane Yang, the first category 7 hurricane, wreaked havoc on the east coast of the United States. Many lives were lost and the public view on climate change FINALLY came to the consensus that anthropogenic climate change needed to be stopped. The Green New Deal, in a revitalized effort was finally passed in the year 2038 and life in the United States was forever changed. Carbon fee and dividend was implemented and the fossil fuel giants crumbled. I remember the panic of 2039 like it was yesterday. Many experts on Wall Street predicted drastic dips in markets globally. They couldn't have been more wrong. Yes the oil giants of the past died a slow death, but in its place rose entire new industries in nuclear fusion and carbon capture, while the solar and wind industries saw drastic growth. What was predicted to ruin our economy, only bolstered it. I attended my first community climate meeting around this time. It was here where I was reminded of the benefits of eating with the climate in mind. It sounded so familiar, almost like I had learned it before, but I couldn't quite put my tongue on it. They called it the climatarian diet and I finally remember learning about it in a Climate Crisis class I took in college. I slowly integrated into this diet, along with my wife and two kids. I remember the difficulties I had trying to get my son to eat such a vegetable heavy diet. I was finally able to make him love his seasonal fruits and veggies with the help of some of the moms in the co-housing community we had moved into. I was skeptical about such co-housing communities but my wife convinced me and I'm glad we did. Everyone here is so welcoming and we've truly built a second family. Some of the guys and I started to garden in a little plot near our houses. It's honestly so much fun, we have a friendly competition going, competing to see who can make the most. It's all fun and games and we end up sharing everything we get. I haven't had to drive in years. While AOC was in office she got behind a huge infrastructure project, funding huge public transit projects. Buses became the cheapest method of transportation and bike lanes became the main lanes. A social movement came about shunning those who drove, just adding to the shift towards mass transit. The temperature rose a total of 3.0 degrees Celsius before it plateaued in 2056. Natural disasters have only gotten worse, but we are more prepared for them nowadays. We haven't seen any signs of cooling yet but the experts in climate science are predicting that it will begin to decrease torwards pre-industrial levels in the coming decades, perhaps sooner with the carbon capture industry seeing the most growth its seen since the "panic" of 2039.    On the other hand, the beef and cattle industry recently died. Alternatives became nearly identical in taste and texture, while being cheaper, causing the more stubborn population to finally convert to an eco-friendly diet. The whole culture around food has taken a huge U-turn since 2038 and the Green New Deal. Just like the movement shunning personal automobiles, a similar one sprung shunning meat and animal products. Much of Europe had already implemented Earth-friendly policies, but post 2038, Europe along with the rest of the world followed the US's lead. I remember hearing about the population reaching 10 billion by 2050 in my youth. Fortunately, even before the Green New Deal, women's education was on the rise, especially in developing nations. Equality became a worldwide movement and many developed nations joined together in support of women struggling in developing nations. In 2050 we saw population plateau at 9 billion, well below the predicted value, and an amount that would be sustainable for the future. It's not perfect, not yet. There are still some populations going against the Green New Deal religiously claiming it goes against their cultural values. Despite this, I'd say that society as a whole would  be unrecognizable to 2020 me, a fresh college student. The roads empty of cars and gas stations not on every corner. Bikes roaming the streets past more than campus. The world has changed, I'd say for the better. The planet is recovering, people actually agree on things, and the world is no longer in utter chaos.

<p>

When thinking about the future, we must look back on our past and examine what needs to be done differently because clearly in the state we are in now, our methods must be changed now to make our future selves has something to actually look back on and be proud of our progress. Ken says that when he was younger he remembered reading and being very frightened for the future and here we are...still frightened. I think we can use our current global events to put into perspective the power of our actions. With the coronavirus spreading, you see the effect it is having on people and the drastic measures people are willing to take in order to prevent world chaos. We see that it is possible to alter lifestyles in a short amount of time when it is needed for the better good of ourselves and of the world. Why should our actions toward climate change be any different? We can also see the panic people are in due to a necessity for rapid change and if we understand that that panic will not need to occur in the future if we can gradually contribute to the cause, we should be acting now in preparation. The problem is, if we were given the chance to prepare for an event such as the pandemic occurring now, people probably wouldn't take action. They would say well it isn't happening now so I don't need to do anything until I see if for myself. That is the kind of attitude our world has and shows towards the climate crisis as well. We are going to wait until its too late and then scramble to undo damage that is undoable. While we are in a very stressful time right now, looking ahead to the future through the lens of climate change, we can think about the positive effects of the decline in consumerism and decline in population and experience what the world would be like if we followed the simple solutions outlined in previous videos. Evidence has shown that since the start of the spread of the virus, Chinas air quality has greatly improved and I think that says a lot about our world and is one positive thing we should take out of this disaster. Additionally, seeing the positives of spending time in smaller spaces with the more simple pleasures of life can give us a glimpse into less materialistic lifestyles and privy us to what life could be like. I think we should be really considering what is going on around us right now and place ourselves in the future with the constraints we have currently because it can honestly be viewed as s sort of test run for what we are capable of in helping our world survive the climate crisis. 
     <br><br>

Hopefully, our future selves will be able to look back on this time with a different perspective than the people of today look back at the past. I have hopes for our future to be much different and for people to be able to think of the lack of action people are taking today as totally crazy because of how much things have changed. Consumerism, politics, the economy, personal lifestyles, and so much more will hopefully be unrecognizable in comparison to the state they are all in today. 
     <br><br>

My biggest wish above all, however, is for this message to even make it 20 years into the future. We don't know the fate of our world with the downward spiral of the effects of the climate change crisis and we should use this platform as our goal to keep our planet alive to be able to make the changes needed in order to be a part of this future life we speak of.

Dear Future Self:     <br><br>

Aren't you glad you decided to take English 22 and 23 during your first two years of college? Doing so lead you to be more aware of your surroundings and everything that goes on in order to make certain items. I'm proud of you for making so many changes due to the information you obtained. You decided to cut beef out of your diet soon after learning its impacts. Although it did not happen right away, you did it in small steps, and before you knew it, you decided to cut it off entirely and immediately. Now you probably couldn't even imagine eating beef. Although you did not shift into a largely plant based diet quickly, you still followed a Climitarian diet in the mean time. Little by little, you shifted into a largely plant based diet, a goal you had for quite some time. 
     <br><br>
The information obtained not only changed your diet, but it also changed your actions. You were bothered even by stepping into a Forever 21 after watching films such as The True Cost, and you also let your friends know what you found out about it. You settled on living in a smaller house and also decided to settle into  a city environment. You also decided to make sure everything you bought had no palm oil and started buying locally. You took care of how much stuff you threw away and made sure it was as little as possible. Although walk in closets did look really nice when you were a teenager, you knew it wouldn't be ideal because you probably wouldn't have worn every single piece of clothing in it. You also spent more time looking in on who you were going to vote for, knowing they were actually people who were going to push for a change, and figuring out if they actually cared about the environment. You also knew you had to change your thoughts on how much you wanted to travel, and limit it as much as possible. You also learned about slow travel and hopefully have tried it where possible. Also, if you decided on having kids, you settled with only one. 
     <br><br>
I'm proud of you for taking the time to change your ways and learn more about the environment, and the things you could do to help preserve it. I hope by now you had the chance to visit all the national parks in the state, since your first visit to one of them is what made you really appreciate and feel connected to nature.
     <br><br>
Until next time,

Dear Future: 
     <br><br>

Back in 2020, I made the decision to take a class called English 23 at the University of California, Santa Barbara which explored why our climate is changing and what each of us can do about it. To be completely honest I did not think much about climate change nor did I know how complex and severe it was becoming. I was living everyday with the expectation of accomplishing this so called “American Dream” but as soon as I walked into this class, my perspective on housing, transportation, diet and consumer products has truly changed. Each and every time the lecture ended, I would walk out of Campbell Hall with different emotions such as guilt, optimism, hopelessness, motivation, etc. I began to look at America and what a shame it is that we have not done anything significant to try and positively contribute to saving the planet. I ultimately fell into a state of hopelessness and had a mindset of accepting that our planet is going to be unlivable in the future. But, as the quarter progressed, I started to become educated on the multiple ways in which we, as individuals, can contribute to saving the planet. I displayed a positive attitude as I accepted the reality of the earth and automatically started to make changes. I learned that having hope is the most important factor in order for others to be inspired and determined to make a change in their lifestyle. Individuals should make a spot in their heart for despair because it may never go away but that doesn't mean we should stop doing the work of positively contributing to the climate.
     <br><br>

Through the power of education and motivation, my generation was able to be the start of making differences. As a whole, we began to think about what we can do as an individuals and how we can influence and educate the newer generations to make a change. We began to realize that the older generations were deniers and were bothered about the climate change because they will not be facing the repercussions. Deniers will be deniers and wasting our time trying to convince them to get on board is useless. Due to the class, I truly believe there are more believers than deniers so if we all come together and make a change then we can have a great impact on fossil fuel companies and new regulations that need to take place. Also, through education, we will be able to change the attitude and behaviors of the youth. We focussed on our generation and most definitely future generations because they will face the worst effects of climate change chaos. As of right now, in the year 2020, we are already facing multiple dangers such as, sea level rises, multiple wildfires due to the dry climate and tons of CO2 emission. We began to not only look at our future but the future of our children. Why would we want to bring our innocent children into such a world full of disastrous chaos. ACTION takes place now. Anything is possible and every decision matters.
     <br><br>

In the year 2060, I predict we will have now switched to renewable energy sources such as forest gardening, composting toilets, local currencies, and reducing waste. Furthermore, farmers are allowing cows to graze upon different patches of grass each day which allows for the grass to grow instead of the cows demolishing the roots. This type of action is called holistic grazing which will reduce the amount of fossil fuels that are used in the production of food. Also, during elections, our generation will make a huge impact by voting for climate activists as the main concerns as well as health care, economic equality, and infrastructure. Carbon taxes will have been set in place and our carbon emissions will have been lower than ever. Cities will have advanced and safe modes of transportation including legitimate safe bike paths that travel as far as you can imagine. This will promote more bike usage as a great mode of transportation. 
     <br><br>

Personally, I will have made huge changes to my lifestyle. I will be living a minimalist lifestyle by only surrounding myself and buying the important necessities I need to survive. But, I will not be limiting myself from buying items that make me happy because I believe that happiness is important. I will be limiting myself from buying the latest trendy clothes,  restrain myself from always switching to the latest iPhone and live in a decent house with a decent car. This so-called “American Dream” of buying the bigger and more expensive things in life is a false ideal. Furthermore, I will be switching my diet to half plant-based because I do not see myself cutting out meat completely. I will also try to consume more chicken and salmon rather than beef. I will save up the money to buy myself solar panels that will help conserve energy and money in the long run. I will have two kids in which I will educate them on the importance of climate change, the importance of making the right decisions and to appreciate the world we live in. This way, next time they choose to fly a plane, drive a car, eat beef, etc, they will have to subconsciously face the fact that they are negatively impacting the climate which will ultimately help them make better decisions. Overall, I do see the world becoming a better and more healthy place to live in. We just need to be consistent and educate the world because I believe there are many individuals like me that have a broad generalization of climate change and did not know the ways in which it is truly impacting our planet as well as the ways in which we can make a change as an individual. Before taking this class, I truly thought climate change was not my problem because I thought I was a useless individual who does not have the power to make any sort of change. But I was wrong. Every single voice matters, just as every vote matters and every penny matters. I would like to thank my former professor Ken for taking the time to truly make a difference and educate the younger generations.

The year is 2020. During my first year of college, in a hectic attempt to find available GE classes that would not plummet my GPA, I came across a class dubbed “The Climate Crisis”. As someone who grew up in a fairly open-minded middle class community, I thought I was well aware of all the terrible repercussions that would occur due to the over emission of carbon dioxide gas. Oh, how silly I was. My professor, Ken Hiltner, opened my eyes to how truly terrible our situation was. I now knew of everything to expect in the near future: heat death, starvation, intense climate, war, economic collapse, etc. It was frightening. However, with the class came a sense of optimism. I knew that, although this future was imminent, there were steps me and my fellow classmates could take to mitigate the effects, and as a result, strive for a better world. 
     <br><br>
That was the year of my personal change. I started small, making any possible alterations to save the planet. I began to watch what I ate and used my bike as a mode of transportation. It was difficult at first, but I strived to change for the better. It didn’t take long, however, to realize that my efforts alone weren’t enough to preserve the prosperity of the planet. I had to do more. I began to partake in environmental activism and strived for new legislation that supported my views. 
     <br><br>
The year is 2025. After the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw massive improvements in world politics. People were finally starting to work together to solve issues and the newer generation was proving just how capable they were to handle new, unforeseen problems. Many prominent world leaders were kicked out of office due to their failure to adequately assess the situation and we had a brand new generation of leaders leading the world. It took an admittedly long time but we were finally able to enact the Green New Deal, and although many had difficulty adjusting, we all knew it was for the better. In the meantime,  I noticed an overall improvement in my wellbeing. Not only was I benefiting the planet, but I was also benefiting me. I had a healthier diet, spent less money, owned less materialistic goods(despite still carrying my laptop and phone wherever I went). I really just felt good about life. I had just finished college a year prior and the economy was finally starting to find its footing again.
     <br><br>
The year is 2060. The fruits of our labor had finally shown progression and the earth was at peace. We managed to control our population growth and the average American’s carbon footprint was 1/8th of what it used to be. At 2.08 metric tons of CO2 emitted annually, the Average American was just over the benchmark we had created years prior. The new generation was beginning to flourish and our footsteps were being followed. On top of all the legislation that had passed, brand new technological innovation helped aid the process to save the planet. Things weren’t necessarily perfect. There was still flooding, starvation and many tragic deaths that occurred as a result; however, we were happy we made the change when we did.

<p>
The Year is  2060

     <br><br>


            Hey, how's it going. Surprised that I’m able to write to you? Thought so, even when most all of English 23 pointed to the downfall of human existence, we were able to make it. Just like Keneth mentioned, change needed to happen and despite all the naysayers it happened quicker than expected. It started when the coronavirus swiped the nation not only becoming a national pandemic but also a global pandemic. The virus adapted quicker than anyone could imagine. Schools, sports, and mostly everything was stopped to limit the spread of the virus. There were some dark times but the unthinkable happened. The whole world was able to come together and found a solution. 

     <br><br>

            Another thing that promoted change was after the presidential election in which the Democrats took back the office. After Bernie became the president he pushed for change socially. His ideas created a movement in which people in the United States started to wake up and take action.  The hardest part was convincing the world that climate change was here. Oil companies tried their best to hide the truth but due to AOC, Bernie, and those supporting change were able to fight back. New plans were formed in which carbon tax became a reality and the CO2 emissions started to drop. The government started to support clean energy sources like solar and wind across the US. 


            <br><br>
     Just like before the whole world came together and started to support the movement for a better sustainable future. The change was on a massive scale with changes in our everyday lives as people got more educated. Believe it or not, the videos in English 23 really helped out with spreading the information on how to change for a better future. Eating more of a plant-based diet was the biggest change as it affected the consumption of meat products which resulted in a loss for the industry. However, it didn't affect the economy as more jobs started to replace it. Also, bikes and slow travel became mainstream. We stopped being a society that over-consume into one that is able to be mindful of the planet when buying products. Like clothes we once again use them more than one time and use them until we cant no more. The change was on a global scale. However, it was due to climate activists that made sure the government remained working for a better sustainable future for the people.

         <br><br>

             The change did happen and it is surprising to see so many people waking up and taking action for the benefit of the planet but also for future generations. We learned from the mistakes of our past generations and lucky we didn't repeat the same history of denying the truth. We changed and fought for a better sustainable future and are now seeing the fruits of our labor.

A message from the future:

         <br><br>

This is the year 2060, and I am going to celebrate my 59th birthday. According to the traditional Chinese zodiac culture, this year is the year of Golden Dragon, which symbolizes greatness, good fortune, and auspicious meanings. Indeed, the cumulative effort of all people from the past 40 years has made our world a truly better place, a place where, no matter humans or non-humans, no matter rich or poor, no matter what religious background, what sexual orientation, what race and ethnicity, can live joyfully and happily together, peacefully on our one and only mother planet, Earth. 

         <br><br>

Surprisingly, this year also marks my 30th wedding anniversary with my dear husband. Living in large houses in the urban centers could be very energy-wasting when considering the protection of the environment, and a positive trend is, nowadays more and more people are starting to build their own tiny houses. My husband, who is a very passionate environmental activist, decided to build our own tiny house in New Zealand, just like the tiny habitats that the Hobbits used to live in. It is a wooden two-floor tiny house with four wheels installed so that we are free to move to a new place with ease. The first floor consists of a two-person sofa, a small couch, a small kitchen with induction cookers, an airplane-size bathroom, and a wooden table that can be used as both a dining table and a relaxing table. On the second floor, we have a queen-size bed mattress, a small nightstand with an energy-saving lamp. My husband has even designed a sunroof. Every night when we lie down, we are able to see the dark night sky, decorated with diamond-like stars, and the gorgeous Milky Way. As environmental activists, my husband and I really enjoy living close to mother nature to fully appreciate its beauty. 

         <br><br>

Considering the impact on the environment, my husband and I reached an agreement of not giving birth to any babies. However, we both care about the wellbeing of those orphaned children, as a result, we fundraised an orphanage with a complete internal education system that guaranteed education for every single child. The top two most important courses are climate change and environmental studies. In this age, everyone understands the importance of cultural change regarding a greener planet, and the education system worldwide is putting great emphasis on the significance of climate change and environmental studies; all of the school-aged children are well equipped with the related knowledge that they are able to apply to their daily lives. Although my husband and I do not have any biological children, we actually adopted two children, a boy and a girl from our fundraised orphanage. My boy, named Rain, is now a 24-year-old graduate student at the University of California Santa Barbara, majoring in Environmental Studies. He, as well, is inspired by our great passion for climate change and is able to start his own research on a project that focuses on inventing energy-saving electronic products. My girl, named Daisy, is now in her freshman year at UCSB, the same university as her brother. Although her major choice remains undeclared, she is taking a course in climate change and also grows very interested in this field. I’m sure she will become another great environmental activist in the future.
         <br><br>


Our household takes an entire practice of green lifestyle. The four of us all become vegetarians; our daily meals are largely plant-based, including some cheese, eggs, and organic juices. Right now, I am proud to tell that, based on the effort and dedication from multiple generations, the world is almost free of beef agriculture and beef production companies. Most of the ordinary everyday citizens live similar lifestyles like us, which are largely plant-based, with absolutely no consumption of beef. For transportation, the public transportation branch is very advanced and developed, 99% of the people choose to reach their destinations by either walking, biking, or taking public transportations. 

         <br><br>

It is an enjoyable time for all of us. It is a time that our mother nature is able to take a breath from the previous heavy exploitation done by humans; it is a time that we humans are able to pause, reflect, and revise our actions and mindsets to consider what is a truly meaningful life. I know you are now in the year 2020. It might be tough, but please remember, every success requires a difficult transition. Here, take my blessings, everything will be fine. Everything.

A message from the future:

         <br><br>

It was November 7 2020, my 20th birthday (and the presidential election), the day I decided to go 100% carbon free. Bernie Sanders had won the election, with the largest following of climate activists behind him. A revolutionary time indeed, I never thought that we could do this. For this new generation of young activists, it was the start of something amazing. 
         <br><br>


Bernie Sanders started to create progressive legislation immediately, with an emphasis on creating carbon taxes, while cutting down on supply of fossil fuels. People not only started to purchase electric cars, but individual state governments started to change their infrastructure. These changes included more bike lanes on the street, a large amount of electric bikes started to be produced, and more legislative changes to accommodate these changes. 

         <br><br>

Bernie not only inspired legislative change, but encouraged larger companies to all pitch in a carbon tax and use a portion of their millions of dollars made to help fight the climate crisis. He wasn't too easy on these companies, and cut the ability for them to have unfair tax cuts. These taxes for over shore manufacturing and destructive types of manufacturing were taxed more heavily, and this money provided citizens with more resources to help the environment. More education on women's healthcare had been offered in states that had little-to-no education about the topic. This later encouraged more people to be careful about how many children they have, in order to not overpopulate. 

         <br><br>

Bernie had inspired a long line of presidents, who slowly made more and more changes to help keep his momentum going. These politicians reached out globally to encourage other countries to develop greener uses of energy and consumption policy. These politicians (slowly but surely) encouraged people that consumer culture is destructive to the environment. 
         <br><br>


The whole world had transitioned to a mostly plant-based diet in 2040. It was people who started to fight for it (Back in the early 2000’s) earlier, who inspired change in people who had been skeptical. Government outreach programs encouraged the consumption of plant based food through food banks and popular local food markets. It wasn't just the government though, it was the population that understood that the farming industry was destructive to ourselves and the ozone layer. Becoming healthy and avoiding becoming addicted to unhealthy foods(meat, cheese, etc.)became more of a widespread phenomenon in America. 
         <br><br>


Literature that encouraged fighting against the climate crisis had become more common. More online information had become more accommodating to people wanting to make a carbon neutral change. While this literature had become more widespread, classes such as Climate Crisis 101 had been used at more schools around the country. 
         <br><br>


This class has truly changed my life for the better, and I couldn't be more appreciative of Ken spending his time and energy to educate students about the more important issues at hand. I will always use the information you gave to me to make this world a safer, healthier, and cleaner place. 


</p><hr>


<p>

Dear Future Self:
         <br><br>

Along with my study experience in both the Western and Eastern worlds, I found that the narrative of a story can transcend any cultural boundary. For instance, I can tell stories that happened in China with the methodologies and techniques that I learned in US colleges. While I feel grateful for the modern world that endows us with the highly advanced media technologies to express my thought freely, modernity is also associated with growing global inequality, discriminations, and environmental catastrophes, so I am intrigued to dig the hidden reality and spread it to the world through humanistic storytelling. 
         <br><br>

The huge problem is that many people are truly not aware of social issues such as poverty and environmental catastrophes as they not always shown to the public because of media manipulation by political parties and large companies. As a current college student who is lucky enough to have the opportunity to receive higher educations, I held the responsibility to utilize the resources and guidance from professionals in school to reveal the hidden realities about social and environmental dilemma and make voices for the disadvantaged. The history of Blaxploitation films in the 1970s has already shown the power of visual storytelling in raising the public awareness of the black as well as giving African Americans cultural confidence. I hope my films can also make voices for disadvantaged and reveal the truths about environmental problems, raising public consciousness about these problems.
         <br><br>

As a person who fortunately studies and lives in a developed country, I have abundant resources, but I did not realize I used so many unnecessary resources that it could indeed negatively influence the life of others on the other side of the planet. Before, I never thought about what really cost to make certain foods and how many unethical harms there are that I had brought for other conscious beings. Now I know a person can live healthily even without eating meat, and less livestock can also significantly reduces the emission of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, so I decided to become a vegan for the rest of my life. 
         <br><br>

With this new perspective from Ken's Lecture, I want to devote myself to the career of environmental media and make films that have an educational impact on the issue of global warming because there is still a need for more people to be aware of the problem and how to solve it in a humanistic approach. I changed my attitude of how to interact with the world around me and the Earth that I inhabit on, since then I stop taking things for granted. Little can one person do, but the public concern is the most effective means to solve a severe social problem. I hanker for contributing to revealing the hidden realities through film making and voicing the aspirations of disadvantages to improving their life quality and ameliorating the current unfulfilling situation. Through visual metaphor, films could eventually awaken some people's consciousness and endow them with the confidence to make real changes. I hope I can use my skills in digital technology to bravely tell the story for those who need a positive change.

<p>

On this day 40 years ago, in March of 2020, I was in my first year of college. Students had just been sent an email that told us to pack our bags and move back home for the remainder of the year due to the rapidly spreading COVID -19 --  a heightened flu caused by Coronavirus that was killing people across the world. Somehow, the chaos of moving back home during finals week and saying goodbye to the friends I had just made didn’t surprise or overwhelm me. I think this was due to building anticipation of disaster many of us had been feeling throughout the entire quarter. Now, at least, something had happened to press pause on an international level. 
         <br><br>

In the months before the cancellation of school, life at UCSB was already chaotic. TA’s had been on strike for weeks, protesting graduate student wages and living costs. There had been multiple fires in California, one setting the mountains outlying UCSB ablaze (I watched it spread through my dorm window throughout the night). We were in the midst of a make-or-break primary between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the two democrats who would oppose the infamous Donald Trump in November. At UCSB, many of us felt that if Bernie didn’t win, all hope was lost for beating climate change. At least I did. Winter quarter of 2020 was also the time when I enrolled in English 23, a course on the climate crisis. Everything that I learned in Engl. 23 made the things happening in the world around me feel much bigger, much scarier, much more urgent. This class also helped me see the thread connecting each issue we were facing. The COLA strike, Coronavirus pandemic, election mania, and natural disasters were not four separate phenomena. There were all markers of the wall that neoliberal America had finally hit. 
         <br><br>

Coming home that spring brought up a lot of emotions. I was finishing up my final papers and assignments for some of the most eye-opening classes I had ever taken: The Climate Crisis, Media Criticism, and Human Sexuality. Again, I was feeling this overwhelming connection between all of the issues we discussed in each of these classes. It had been hard for me to sit through the quarter in beautiful Isla Vista, partying and going to the beach and doing homework and going to class, feeling like the world was simultaneously ending and I was not doing a single thing about it. Then I was home, and those feelings magnified. We were essentially regionally quartentined. I opened Instagram one morning and saw that Greta Thunberg, the bold leader of a world-wide climate change strike “Friday’s for Future,” had moved the civil disobedience movement online due to the virus. 
         <br><br>

March of 2020 was memorable for me because it was the most hopeless I felt about the future of our planet and the human race. I felt like the world was rapidly falling apart and we Americans, radically misinformed and debilitated by a corrupt government, were letting the pieces slide through our fingers. 
         <br><br>

Then things began to change. 40 years ago, I read a newspaper article in the SF Chronicle about a failed lawsuit. 21 kids had attempted to sue the government for putting their lives and futures at risk due to climate inaction. The article said that a legal team had formed to help the kids get a second shot. Suddenly, the lawsuit began to take over the media. We all got behind it. The Corona pandemic, strangely, helped. It acted as the wake up call we all needed -- the reminder that we all live in a digital global village of sorts. Information could spread so quickly. We took advantage of our global village and entered an extreme state of civil disobedience, inspired by Greta. We ceased to attend school (even online classes). We boycotted the big companies running our capitalist country. Most importantly, we were able to get everyone on board -- all youths who cared about the planet. We were already entering a Great Depression due to the virus, and we capitalized on the opportunity to make corporate America suffer. And it did. The lawsuit was denied time and time again, but we did not stop our protests. Meanwhile, I was making personal changes along with so many others. These changes were largely guided by a lecture from Engl. 23 outlining the biggest-impact lifestyle changes we can make to combat the crisis. 
         <br><br>

Once the coronavirus had cleared enough to allow public gatherings again, we marched on the White House. Joe Biden had won the election, and that had been our final straw. He was corporate, and corporate America’s time had RUN OUT. In a highly organized, safe, and efficient manner, we burned down the White House. No one was hurt, but the message was clear: the next generation had taken over. The lawsuit that had been repeatedly dismissed meant nothing now -- it was our time to call the shots. AOC and Bernie Sanders rose as the leaders of a new world order. We ripped up the constitution and we started fresh. 
         <br><br>

What did that mean? An end to fossil fuels and any release of carbon. A complete redistribution of wealth. There were no more billionaires. In fact, there were no more millionaires. We used that money to help those who would suffer due to the end of their cattle, oil, and coal industries. Yes, there was resistance, but no one’s resistance was as strong or as powerful as ours. We won because we stood together in solidarity and refused to take no for an answer -- to ANYTHING. 
         <br><br>

Today, we are still working hard to live sustainably. Some people are still fighting a born impulse for capitalist greed and needless consumption. But the government is now here to support those people and everyone else for the primary goal of preserving our one and only home, planet earth.

I'm writing to you in my own 60 years. I live in 2060 now, but you live in 2020. In this short period of 40 years, time is not the only standard that can be used to measure the changes in this short period of time. The whole world has become completely different. In this letter, I will carefully compare how the world has changed, how human beings and other creatures have become.




         <br><br>


In 2020, I firmly believe that the climate crisis is a very serious thing. I have also been committed to changing my lifestyle to reduce carbon emissions as much as possible. At the same time, I have been trying to encourage people around me to join the environmental protection team. ,




         <br><br>


I know that in 2020, the climate crisis is a major event. In order to better protect the world we live in and let human beings and other creatures continue to live on this earth, scientists have carried out numerous studies, put forward numerous conclusions and made numerous assumptions. Even when I was in college, climate crisis became a very important course. To this day, I can finally tell you that the current climate crisis has been effectively controlled. As I thought 40 years ago, this is the result of the joint efforts of people all over the world. But maintaining carbon dioxide emissions is still our goal. We are still paying attention to all aspects of life to avoid the environment falling into crisis again. In 2060, most people in the world have fully adapted to a healthier diet. Many people are vegetarians or vegetarians. This means that the human demand for meat is getting smaller and smaller, and the breeding capacity of all kinds of poultry is also getting smaller and smaller. This is something we didn't dare and couldn't do 40 years ago. A lot of carbon emissions have been reduced.



         <br><br>



This is a small thing happened in 2060, but it is enough to see that people have made great efforts to protect the environment. Here, I would like to call on you to do your best to protect the earth and maintain a positive attitude and optimistic attitude.



</p><hr>


<p>
Thinking back to where it all started, I was a sophomore in college at the University of California, Santa Barbara, now more famously known as the first carbon negative college campus in the world. I took a class called ENGL 23 with my friend Lindsey because we were both fired up about the beginning of the climate crisis and wanted to learn more while instilling that passion into others we knew. This class was during the most important year for the climate crisis: 2020. This was the year of Presidential Election in a post-Trump American political system. Temperatures were tremendously increasing in the US, politics completely devastated families, food insecurity was on the rise, and capitalism was still flourishing unfettered. College students and young people alike had this burning passion to change the system that older generations had created. It was outdated and many knew it was failing the people and only benefiting the elite 1% of the country. 

         <br><br>

During this time, UCSB’s “residential” area outside of campus known as Isla Vista created a bold new initiative called Carbon Neutral IV by 2025. Lindsey and I got involved because we could see real potential with this program. It involved the UCSB campus, Eco Vista, Cool Block, and Santa Barbara County. Through this program we eliminated all cars in Isla Vista, and added in food forests throughout the 2 square miles to tackle the issue of food waste. My granddaughter now goes there and always grabs a peach or orange on her way to class. We also improved the biking infrastructure within Santa Barbara County, eventually spreading that mentality to all other major cities in the US. San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, Manhattan, Pittsburgh, Dallas, and Boston all copied our adoption of Super Blocks and reduced the lanes for cars from 2 on each side to 1, giving more space for the increasing number of biking commuters. 
         <br><br>


In 2020 we were also able to flip the white house. We unfortunately did not sign the Green New Deal, but we were able to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. Without the Green New Deal, climate activism spread like wildfire. We were able to shut down all fossil fuel power plants in 2030, being led by the Extinction Rebellion. We also pushed Washington to create federal regulations on food waste. Industrial composting was mandated nationally, saving literal tons of methane from reaching our atmosphere. This compost helped to regenerate our soil, allowing our land to produce more food for our growing population. In addition, we were able to get Washington to cut subsidies for meat (sadly not dairy) and the vegetarianism thrived in the US due to the insane prices of meat. 
         <br><br>


After college, I continued my low waste lifestyles and moved to New York where I was able to work for the UN in achieving their sustainable development goals for 2030. This involved meeting with staff from all over the globe. Learning about the struggles from other countries helped me to see just how much countries were being hit. By 2045, Bangladesh was 75% underwater, adding to intense climate migration taking place in South Asia due to sea level rise. The US was able to open our borders to those refugees and gave them work installing solar and wind energy. The UN was also able to continue its initiative of educating girls, something that has dramatically reduced the speed of our population growth. This coupled with countries where the population was actually declining has created space for all races in much of the world. 

         <br><br>

Sadly, we haven't been able to get as much as we wanted done by 2060, but we still have the fire in our soul to continue to push for change. This has helped us persevere through the catastrophic events the climate crisis has thrown our way, but we continue to adapt.

Dear future self,         <br><br>

I honestly hope you're still alive to read this and that the coronavirus didn't take you out (haha remember that) but I just wanted to make sure that everything is alright. I know forty years may have passed, however I hope you did not forget about that one english class you took at UCSB about the climate crisis and the lessons you learned from it. I wanted to make sure that you stopped being such a hypocrite and actually switched over to a more sustainable lifestyle whether that is by buying less stuff, reducing food waste, driving less cars by riding your bicycle more often and maybe even becoming a vegan or vegetarian. You know what it takes to do this, you know the statistics and you know the harm that it causes for people in disadvantaged areas so I hope you have utilized this information to help save our home and other's homes. I know it may be difficult to make the switch due to your peers constantly roasting you for not having the hottest and newest things and other outside pressures causing you to become lazy, however if you really want the planet to survive you got to make the sacrifice. AOC believed that we have all the necessary tools for a better and brighter future, yet the only thing stopping this progression are the people that don't want their culture to change and the non-believers of climate change. You are Hispanic so you should realize that the amount of meat your family cooks whenever they come over for parties or other special events is so bad for the environment. I know we are a large family, with many relatives and those relatives being relatively large, yet it is time for change and you know it. I have already talked with our parents about this issue and I will continue to inform them about what is going on around us; I hope you have continued this, especially to our dumb conservative friends, (you know who they are lol). Stop trying to act cool in front of people that are insignificant to your life and start acting in ways that would better society and the environment. Our future has not been written yet, however I hope you make mine memorable by saving the Earth because we truly can be whatever we have the courage to see. If you have failed to stick to a more sustainable life then I hope you will teach your kids the lessons we've learned from this class and apply it to their lives so that they can grow up and embody that lifestyle. However, knowing me I know you will not fail at this. I hope that the politicians that were in charge during your time were not as foolish as Trump was and actually cared enough to implement the green new deal because I know for a fact that I do not want to live in a dump like that one movie "Idiocracy" or even worse "Wall-E". If things get out of hand then you should start a Youtube channel or whatever it's called in your time and take the initiative to make living a sustainable lifestyle cool so that others can follow in your steps because we all know social media is not going anywhere anytime soon and we know the impacts it has on society. Anyways I wish you luck and I hope you continue to help others out, especially yourself.
         <br><br>
Sincerely,
         <br><br>
Your younger self

Message form 2060:

         <br><br>

In these forty years, our climate has changed so much that now we have to always stay inside under the air-conditioners. There is now no outside for us. There is no nature even. Most of the marine life that was there in 2020 is now gone and land species are not flourishing either. People have been starving and dying due to the climate change. It destroyed their houses and families, but it also put our whole world into crisis. All the factories that the economy in 2020 was holding on were shut down, and there was simply no more new clothes to wear for the world, no plastic cups or bottles, no more food to eat, and so on. We really do live in a chaos right now, and I wish we were more careful in the past.

         <br><br>


I remember in 2020 I had hoped people would focus on what was really important: us restoring the natural habitats of endangered species, us living in close communities, us stopping or at least minimizing our CO2 emissions. Because that is what we had to do to save ourselves from the apocalypse everyone knew was coming. I truly believed we could achieve our goal of stopping climate change, but, unfortunately, it did not happen. Not only did we not stop, but we enlarged our emissions, which caused the temperatures to rise drastically all around the globe. It was the corals that disappeared first. Without corals, most of the people who lived near oceans and ate chiefly fish, could not find food for themselves anymore. Some, who had such ability, migrated to colder regions, where climate change has not hit that hard yet. But most of them stayed, hoping for the best. However, the water levels were rising due to melting ices, and the coastal regions started to get submerged. Starting from 2020, those who survived lived through horror and fear for their own lives. 

         <br><br>

Taking English 23 during the Winter quarter of my freshman year was definitely one of the most influential experiences I have ever had. After taking the class, I decided to change my lifestyle completely. As an international student, I had to fly a lot in the past. Various different errands like visiting family, friends, and simply being at home were my only reasons to fly across the globe and emit thousands of tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. After taking the class, however, I realized that flying was one of the most harmful actions to the environment. I decided to fly less, eat less meat, not to by clothes that I did not need. For a while, the people who were putting effort into changing their lifestyles were the source of light for our world. The only thing humanity lacked was the cooperativeness. In the end, not enough of us were able to bring positive changes into our lives, which led to the world we live in today – one of desperation, regret, and sorrow.

Imagine a place where everything seems to be perfect. The land is full of trees that have not been cut down by large companies, clean water that has not been polluted by waste products and trash and thousands of animals and plants that became extinct due to over hunting. This was what life was like on Earth just a couple of hundreds of years ago but now the world is full of natural disasters, food shortage, and human caused disasters. How did the world go from a place of life, to a danger zone that has a clock ticking down until the day when the world is no longer habitable. The reason is because of human caused climate change. As human history progressed and technology improved, climate change grew as lifestyles became fast paced and selfish. In the class English 23 at University of California, Santa Barbara, the goal was to first learn about the ways in which the climate crisis came about but then talk about the individual and global changes we should and have to make to try and save the earth. 
         <br><br>

From the first week of class, many were shocked at the state and the possible future of the earth especially due to the global temperatures rising. In the reading of “the Uninhabitable Earth”, a very doomsday approach explained all of the possible threats that the earth might race due to global temperature rising. One of the scariest and most impactful threats is the melting of the North Pole. In the span of ten years the North Pole has warmed by sixty to seventy degrees which baked the North pole. As well as melted the Norway Svalbard Seed Vault  and permafrost which is the global food bank and frozen soil which contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon and when thawed it can evaporate as methane leading to higher global temperature rise. Another possible threat due to the global temperature rises is the release of climate plagues which are diseases that have been trapped in ice that haven not resurfaced in years but scientists suspect that the flu, smallpox, and bubonic plague are trapped in the siberian ice and if melted will be released. With the threat of melting there is also the obvious rise in global sea levels which affect coastal cities and islands such as Florida, Caribbean, Bahamas. With the rise in sea levels coastal cities will be cleared out and be completely submerged under water.  
         <br><br>
Another effect of global temperature rise is unpredictable weather and natural disasters. In 2016, California had the Sherpa Fire which scorched the hills of Santa Barbara and was seen as one of the worst fires in history. Then in 2018, seven and a half miles from San Francisco a PGE powerline failed and the electricity continued to run which started a fire. Due to extreme heat weather, California was exceptionally dry. This fire spread through Concow at eighty football fields per minute burning everything in its path. Due to miscommunication and firefighters not believing that the fire was moving at such a fast pace no on in the town of Paradise were warned to evacuate til it was too late and as a result many people died. In four hours Paradise was burnt to the ground and eighty five people passed away. In California four out of five fires have occurred in the last decade and that is not a coincidence. In just Santa Barbara there is a state of change as the cliffs of Del Playa are disappearing, the temperature in just the ventura county is supposed to increase by four degrees by 2050 and the belief is that seventy eight percent of the cities bluffside beaches will be gone by 2060. Santa Barbara if the temperature spikes to one hundred and fifteen will be dangerous to go outside. The rise in temperature is causing farmers to decline and have people switch from avocado to agave or dragon fruit farmers because the crops that they used to have no longer can survive the heat. This is bringing about the threat of possible food shortage or people migrating north to get away from Ecuador.

To my future children:
         <br><br>

It is 2060 and I am 60 years old. I can't believe that I am already 60 years old because there so many things going around in the past especially when I was younger. In college, I took a class called "Engl 23: Climate Crisis" in winter quarter during my second year. And I can confidently and proudly say that it was one of the best choice I have ever made in my college career. I learned a lot from this class and realized how significant climate change has become in our younger lives. When I was younger, climate change was one. of the biggest issues going around the world. There were so much carbon gas emissions in the environment and we had to figure out ways that we can use ro save our planet. Without our planet, where would we be? Politics were our worst enemy because many politicians were so selfish and manipulative. They tried to convince other people that climate change wasn't real. However, we realized that if we continued to fall for their traps and ignored the bad things going around the environment, our planet would eventually collapse. 
         <br><br>

I'm glad that your generation realizes and knows even more the importance of saving our planet. Politicians now are finally understanding the crisis we were going through and putting forth more actions that would help the damage that were made in the past. I'm very proud of the progress that were made. I hope you continue this progress and find out even better ways that would help with saving the planet. Make sure to remember: living a simple life can lead to a better future. Don't be caught in hoping to gain materialistic prosperity and comfort all the time. We must learn how to give up certain things in order to save and help others in our surroundings. If you want a better future, make to remember what is necessary and important around you instead of just yourself. I'm glad that our generation started to make changes in the past because there were many damages done on our homes. But now, It is your job to continue our work. I hope you will understand where I am coming from.

To my beautiful daughter:
         <br><br>


I want to apologize for not giving you a planet where you can live harmoniously with the environment. I could never really fully do that. When I was your age, I took a class called the Climate Crisis, and in that class we learned about how we screwed up the planet. We learned that oceans were rising at unprecedented speeds and coastal cities would flood; we learned that climate disasters would come with an increase in magnitude and frequency; we learned that there would be famine, we learned that there would be an increase in diseases, we learned that there was a greater risk of international conflict. We knew that the future we were headed towards was definitely not one we wanted to give to our children. It certainly wasn’t the one that I anticipated giving to you. So I want to apologize for one of humanity’s greatest failures: the climate crisis.
         <br><br>


When I was your age, we knew with certainty, that things needed to change drastically. Your father and I were ready for change. We were ready to give up eating meat. We were ready to give up our cars. We were ready to give up carbon. But the fact of the matter was, most people were not. Most people wanted a slow gradual change away from fossil fuels and this simply wasn’t an option. President Trump removed us from the Paris Accord, and everyone, democrats included thought that the Green New Deal was too radical to ever function in the U.S. Your father and I pushed for it, but it never passed, and it’s far too late to fix anything. 

         <br><br>

I’m sorry that we couldn’t give you a sibling. Shortly after your father and I had you, they implemented a one-child policy. There already wasn’t enough food for us, adding children into the equation would have just been negligent and irresponsible. I’m incredibly sorry that you will never be able to have your own children. Temperatures are skyrocketing, the world they’ll come to inherit is not one I’d want to inherit. 

         <br><br>

When I was growing up in the U.S.A., as the daughter of migrants from Mexico, I remember thinking about how progressive this country was. 


But our greed poisoned the world. Our greed left a mess that the Global South was left to clean up. In my lifetime, I never struggled to buy food, regardless of how expensive it got. But I know, billions of people didn’t have that choice. Billions of people starved. 

         <br><br>

We should have fixed it. There is nothing left to do now but offer my sympathies. I want you to know that I tried, I wanted to give you a lifetime brighter than mine. All I can say is, enjoy the life you’ve been given. Appreciate it’s resources without taking advantage of them. 


All my love,         <br><br>

Your mother

AOC  mentions in their video “the first big step was just closing our eyes and imagining it. We can be whatever we have the courage to see.” I did exactly this to imagine what the future would look like for me in forty years. I am currently 60 years old and there have been both personal changes and global changes that have occurred.  
 <br><br> I have personally gone through many changes since 2020. This all started when I took the course “The Climate Crisis 101” in the winter of my sophomore year of college. Since then I have built my life around being conscious of the environment. I have made personal choices to fight climate change. I transitioned to being a vegetarian and then to vegan which was a little bit more of a challenge. Once I bought my own small house I had just a big enough yard to have a garden and some chickens. I guess now I could be called a climatarian as I eat the eggs my chickens produce and overall try to eat what's best for the environment during each season. Becoming a climatarian started to become a large trend by the 2030s and was something many people started to adopt. To help people accomplish this, food products began to have climate labels on them to make it easy to decipher what the best food is to eat. I also started to become more involved as a climate activist which I had never fully done. I have fought for better bike lanes throughout the U.S. and have decided that I will primarily commute by bike myself. The bike lanes across The U.S. have gotten much better but could still use some work. I have also made sure that I never miss voting and encourage others to vote as well. In addition, I have chosen to have a compost, only have two kids and live a minimalist lifestyle that is comfortable for me and my family. 
  <br><br>As a planet, we have also seen many changes in the last 40 years, with that said there is still more that could be done. Bernie was elected and we were able to pass the green new deal. We have been able to cut back on fossil fuels, but not entirely. We also passed a carbon tax to make it more expensive to use any CO2. One of the biggest changes we have seen in the U.S. since 2020 is public transportation. I am happy to say that our public transportation system has finally improved greatly. This has been one of the best things that have happened in my lifetime. We have created good safe bike lanes throughout cities. Because of this more people started to ride bikes as it was way cheaper, more enjoyable and oftentimes faster as there is generally no traffic. Many people now use bikes as their main way of transportation which is great because it gets people out of their cars. We have also developed a reliable fast bus and transit system. This is how people can travel further distances. In addition, we have also developed fast track trains to allow people to travel and see new places. This makes it so people no longer fly because it is more convenient and way less expensive to travel.

<p>
As I sit here and type this message I reflect back on both my own and my planet's recent history with a mixture of emotions.  Regret, sadness, and anger fill me as I remember the monumental events that took place within my lifetime, yet for all the negative emotions I feel an underlying presence of acceptance and forgiveness as well.  I have by no means suffered the most as a result of our species reckless actions, and as much as I think the rebirth of our planet has harmed me I am inclined to remember and reflect on those that have gone through pain much worse than my own.  But the burning fire also purges that which fuels it, and I can look back on the pain that humanity has gone through hopeful that it will be the foundation of a better world for all.
         <br><br>

The climate disaster did not happen overnight of course.  For going on 200 years humanity has had the knowledge of what was to come, although that knowledge was spread out and not widely accepted for much of that time.  By the time we got to the beginning of my life most people around me had known that there was a disaster to come, yet still pushed it out of their minds as something uncontrollable that was not worth worrying themselves with on a daily basis.  I was one such person for the majority of the beginning of my life.  Even upon informing myself of the facts of the problem, taking courses on its possible solutions and making some minor changes that made me feel a bit more satisfied with myself, I still could not recognize myself as someone who truly devoted their every effort to save the planet.  
         <br><br>

Going into the 2020 election cycle this was the prevailing view of most Americans.  For every climate change denier there was a climate change accepter who lived a life as disastrous for the environment as the denier themselves.  It was a sad state of national cognitive dissonance, and although many were hopeful when the Democrats won the majority in the Senate that year it would come to be seen that it made little difference in the end.  Of course the green new deal was pushed and pushed, activists desperately trying to convince everyone that it was their last chance for change before they started to experience the effects in their own lives.  But in the end it was not only the far right climate deniers that were tying our species noose, but the moderate democrats who wanted the solution to the crisis to come easy and without impact on their lives.
         <br><br>

Environmental legislation was passed of course, we vastly expanded our renewable energy production, made changes to air conditioning and refrigeration that harmed the environment, and even cut down the amount of fracking we were doing immensely.  Had these changes been made in the 1990’s they would have been a fantastic start.  But it was still 30 years too late and 60% too little.  No extensive carbon tax was ever put into place.  The beef industry remained pumping out immense amounts of methane.  Americans were still flying more and more each year.  
         <br><br>

I hate to say it but as much as I despised the insufficient action taking place in our government, I still enjoyed many of the benefits fossil fuels brought.  I was not alone.
         <br><br>

The disaster really started happening in the 2040’s.  Although in the time between 2020 and 2040 our government and the governments of the world continued to expand on new green legislation, the legislative, bureaucratic, and political hoops needing to be jumped through slowed us down an unacceptable amount.  We could see the effects during that time alright, more varied and intense seasons, increases in tropical storms and the near death of all coral on the planet to name a few, but they all seemed somewhat liveable.
         <br><br>

The mass migrations were what lit a metaphorical, and in some places literal, fire under the ass of the planet.  In 2045 there was a record amount of sea level rise.  Coupled with a dramatic decrease in the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems, millions of people were suddenly left homeless or foodless in the areas their people had lived happily for thousands of years.  I remembered during that time the immigration “crisis” of the 2010’s, and wanted to laugh in a morbidly depressing way.  Conservatives back then believed that the immigration rates were unacceptably high and that the U.S. needed to tighten our borders.  In 2045 any hardcore conservative would have fought their very hardest to have immigration be taking place at twice the rate of 2016.  All over the world both developed and developing nations were struggling with an influx of people, that is the ones that were not being left in droves due to the aforementioned climate disasters. 
         <br><br>

Of course the political and social conflicts that resulted from these mass migrations caused panic and disarray.  It was a frightening time, and to this day I am grateful the world didn’t erupt into war.  In a turn of events the migrations finally served as the wake-up call the world needed, and within the end of the decade such radical changes had been made in how our species interacts with our environment that we were set up for permanent sustainability.  As it turned out we had the ability to do so for decades, it was merely the motivation that made it happen.
         <br><br>

But of course we all knew that it was too late in many ways.  We collectively recognized that it was going to get much worse before it got any better, and on a positive note banded together to withstand the disaster as best we could, as one human race.  Global conflicts drastically decreased and the strength of the United Nations became much more prevalent, unifying the world under one goal for the first time in human history.
         <br><br>

The next decade was rough, we tried to stop the events that took place as best we could, but it was only delaying the inevitable.  Miami is now underwater.  Species of animals and ocean life I read about in books as a child went extinct, never to be viewed by human eyes again.  We had to save what we could, and miraculously were able to halt the melting of arctic permafrost by means of both technology and sheer human will.  It was the last stop before the climate disaster would become the climate apocalypse, and we somehow were able to pull back the reins before skidding right into our demise.
         <br><br>

So as I look back on my life and the life of my planet I am poignant once more.  I still have restless nights thinking about how much more we could have done, how much suffering we could have prevented.  I still want to cry when I think about how I will never be able to see a coral reef, or admire the size of an African elephant in person.  Yet I am overall still proud of humanity in a strange way.  As much as we hurt ourselves and those around us in the end we are the most adaptable creatures on this Earth, and I look forward to a future in which my grandchildren will live in a unified and sustainable way.

To Who Remain
         <br><br>
This was the first course I took at UCSB that genuinely made me reconsider my daily lifestyle. I was embarrassed, appalled, and heartbroken by the destruction we have put into the world through obliviously contributing to emitting greenhouse gases. Then I was inspired, encouraged, and passionate for change. During this course, I changed my major from Pre-Biology to Environmental Science. I want others to be angry and hungry for change. I want people to be passionate enough to vote. I want people to understand that they matter and their actions matter. Actions have repercussions, whether it means they result in the reduction of a carbon footprint or the temperature rising. 
         <br><br>
Please be mindful of what or how you contribute to the world. Rely on a mainly plant-based diet, grow your own food, do not participate in fast fashion, thrift, don't waste. In the words of Jack Johnson: REDUSE, REUSE, RECYCLE. Please do not be oblivious or ignorant to the change that occurs around you. The temperature is rising, and I hope it has plateaued or decreased by now. I hope the natural disasters have ceased as vigorous as they were when I was in high school and early college. I hope the world has moved onto energy alternatives and oil alternatives. I hope public transportation is the new means of travel. I hope people have less stuff and consumer culture is not as popular. I genuinely hope that world hunger is no longer an issue, that the world population has stopped skyrocketing, that women are educated as much as men, and that birth control and family planning is accessible to all. 
         <br><br>
I hope that you, Maia, have made an impact on the world in a positive light. I hope you are an environmental lawyer trying to make a change. I hope you are living a simple life, eating a vegan diet, and that you make time for the things that make you happy.

A message to the future:           <br><br>

In the year 2020, I took the course English 23 also known as "Climate Crisis 101."  In this course I learned about how bad climate change has gotten and how it will get worse if we continue to do nothing about it.  Before taking this course I was very ignorant about the whole "climate crisis."  I had heard of climate change before but I did not really take it very seriously nor did I look into it much.  
         <br><br>


While taking the course I was very fascinated yet very frightened by how bad the climate crisis has gotten and will continue to get if we do not do anything now.  In the beginning of the course I learned about the dangers of climate change and I began to believe it was already too late to even attempt anything to stop it from happening.  I was wrong, Ken made me realize that there are so many things we can do to cause change and to stop climate change, but we have to take action now.  

         <br><br>

.... Winter quarter is now over and I now know and understand what the climate crisis actually is and how it is affecting, and will continue to affect us and future generations.  With all of the knowledge I now know about the situation, I begin to take all of Ken's advice and knowledge that he taught me and put into use.  I slowly begin to change my habits involving everything in my life that created a huge carbon footprint.  I now stop shopping online, I begin to donate much of my belongings away to people who actually need it.  Before I would continuously buy clothes online and different items online as well.  Items that in reality I did not need at all, and I was only making it worse on the environment.  I now only own one pair of shoes, and very limited clothing, but enough for me.  I do not have several pairs of shoes anymore, and my closet is not filled with unnecessary pieces of clothing that I do not need, and never have needed.  I now only shop strictly for items that are a necessity now rather than a want.  

         <br><br>

It is now my final year in college and I have changed a lot in my life to counteract the climate crisis.  I have now switched to strictly traveling through public transportation when I need to get to places far away.  And when I don't have to travel as far I use a bike.  Just as my professor did back in my freshman year.  I don't plan on stopping here just yet I want to continue to change my ways of living and further improve my habits to help against the climate crisis.  I have not been able to do it now but I will eventually, and that goal is to someday switch my diet to a strict plant based diet.  Doing this would be so effective, not only for the environment but for everybody.  I say this because if I were to switch many of my friends and family would surely follow my example once I were to explain to them why I have done so and I have informed them about the "climate crisis."

         <br><br>

It is the year 2030, I have successfully graduated the University of California Santa Barbara with a bachelor's of science degree.  Much more things have now changed in my life.  Looking back to my freshman year in college I was very reckless with what I would consume, and what I would do to only contribute to the climate crisis.  A huge goal that I have achieved is I have switched to a strictly plant based diet.  I have been going through with this diet for the past 5 years!  At first it was very difficult, but I was able to only consume plant based meals.  

         <br><br>

The year is now 2060, and everybody's carbon footprint is as low as it has ever been.  People have stopped traveling through the air, they have started commuting, and taking public transportation.  Companies have stopped fracking and burning for fossil fuels.  The future is as bright as it has ever been in terms of the climate crisis.  Although the climate crisis is not over yet and is far from being over we have given hope to future generations.

Dear children,         <br><br>

I am writing this to state all of the things I’ve done to help reverse climate change. It is the year 2060, and we have done it. Everyone told us that we would not make it this long if we continued to treat our climate the way we did. I think you will be interested to hear about everything I have accomplished in the past 40 years. First, let me tell you about how it all started. 
         <br><br>
I was a sophomore at the University of California, Santa Barbara when I decided to take a class about climate change. Through the 10 week quarter, I learned so much about the biggest and most impactful ways that I, as a 20 year old, could work on lowering my personal carbon footprint. We learned about everything on this earth that is leading to climate change and global warming, and learned about all of the ways that we could slow it down. I knew that I had to start small, and that some of these factors that led to the warming of the earth were out of my hands. I learned how to use everything in my power to reduce climate change, so here it goes. 
         <br><br>
2040: Up until this time in my life, I had never eaten red meat. Beef is the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions from the food industry. By never eating beef, I had already cut down on my emissions since the day I was born. Something that I was able to do in 2020 for the first time was vote. My climate change professor has explained to us time and time again the importance of researching who was running in each election and what their beliefs were on certain issues. Also, I learned that I could not trust everything online that I saw, and if I wanted to vote honestly and for my opinions and demands, I had to do some outside research regarding what each candidate stood for. Additionally, in all of my college years, I rode my bicycle to school, rather than drove a car everyday, and lived in communal housing with one or more roommates. Both of these things cut down on my personal carbon emissions. Although small, these aspects in 2020 were a great start to my plan on conquering climate change in the years to come. 
         <br><br>
2040: By 2040 I was married. Your father and I had always wanted a big family and a giant house, but we’d decided against both of those things so that we could reduce our own carbon emissions. The general idea is that each family should have one child per person, or two children per couple. So, we gave birth to the two oldest, and then were able to curve around this rule by adopting two more. In this case, we were able to have four children, and have a big family, while not adding to the horrible overpopulation that our world is under. Also, we were able to move into a moderately sized house and minimize having three bedrooms, where the children shared two of them. Additionally, we had a garden in our backyard where we grew local produce and shared it with friends and family, Not only did this cut down on our spending and environmental costs, but it also made us happier and more connected with our community. As a family, we have also always wanted pets, so we were able to raise chickens in order to eat their eggs. This was a great way for you kids to get connected with a pet, but also to get more fresh food to cut down on costs. 
         <br><br>
2060: At this point, I had decided to make a big change and my life was completely different in the last two decades. I had gotten very fed up with the climate crisis, and I felt that something needed to be done to stop it. The big issue was with fracking and the burning of fossil fuels. When i was younger, in college, and learning about how fracking causes so much damage to our environment, I thought that there was nothing that I could do about it. When I was about 45, I decided to make a change. I went undercover at a huge oil fracking cooperation, and had plans of shutting it down. Of course, I started at a lower tier position in the company. I managed to keep a great rapport with all of my co workers and the higher up bosses, in order to work my way up and get promotions. My end goal was to stop this company from fracking and emitting so much CO2 into the air. Once I got a promotion, time and time again, I continued to put on a face like I was appreciating this company, even though I despised it. I began to make a lot more money that I was used to, and ultimately put most of my salary into savings for you four kids, then donated to more climate research funding. Once I got to the top, I was able to mess up production and shut down the entire company. Many people were mad at me, and many people were upset that they had lost jobs and were going to lose money, but it was more important to me that this fracking would stop. I know that some people still hate me for this, but if there is one less company fracking oil in this world, I know that it is only doing good for the climate. 
         <br><br>
Overall, my main message to you guys is that sometimes you need to do something difficult in order to make a change. If you see that something is going to be beneficial in the world, I encourage you to go for it. 
         <br><br>
Love, 
         <br><br>

<p>
(3/11/20) :  In 40 years from now I would like to believe that the world has changed for the better and taken an initiative on climate change. If we haven't done anything by that time, then it means most of us would be in an awful scenario.

         <br><br>

Let's imagine a future where change does occur.
         <br><br>


At the end of UCSB's winter quarter, a student in Ken Hiltner's Climate Crisis class decides that enough is finally enough. They decide that they want to make a change. Over spring break amidst the Corona Virus scare, this student starts planning for the future. They think the best way to influence the world at this point in time will be to create something that is easily available for the public. 
         <br><br>


However, the student knows this will only be practical if people believe in climate change to begin with. So, what is stopping people from changing in the first place? Is it a lack of education or an unwillingness to believe? Regardless, this students sets out to find why these people do not look for change on their own. They contact everyone in their family on both the west and east coasts to look for answers. Each family member has been to college. The student gets answers ranging from, “Of course I believe in climate change!” to “It’s just a load of crap to scare people”. Ok, so if it is not an education matter, then does it rely on the community they are in? The student sought out members of each family member’s group that they hang out in. They noticed a striking similarity, almost everyone in the group had the same ideals! If they don’t share a similar view then they kept it to themselves, especially if they were in the minority. 

         <br><br>

So this provided a new problem now, how do you get people to change their minds without offending someone’s belief. An incentive? A group discussion? There doesn’t seem to be a right answer here. But what if we can actually show the climate skeptics irrefutable evidence? Then they would have to believe right? But what is this still doesn’t change their mind -- what is holding them back from looking at the evidence?

         <br><br>

Then it hit the student, what if it is fear of the truth? Knowing that climate change may be real would seriously impact their comfortable life. As individuals they wouldn’t be able to do much, especially given their situation in life. So they refuse to believe climate change could be real to protect their own safe reality.  Is there a solution to this? How do uproot a deep-set fear that has been dug so deep you can’t even find where it began?
         <br><br>


Well, this student found out why and how to deal with it. They started changing communities one by one until entire counties were on the side of climate change. People began to start listening to their communities and started to take up environmentally friendly habits. Vegetarian restaurants started to pop up like weeds. People vouched to only take public transportation whenever they could. Parents decided that only one child would be enough for their happiness. People started planting their own vegetable gardens. We started to unite the people towards a common cause. We spread the climate change bug like a virus to save the planet. What started from an individual led to the incremental change from neighbors, to communities, to counties and then to countries. An individual became the catalyst that saved the planet.




</p><hr>


<p>
It’s 2060. I’m standing in my room, gazing outside the window and looking at the destruction, and I think back and wonder if I could have done more. It started out in 2020 after taking English 23, a class on the climate crisis. I started to try and reduce my climate footprint. I began making little changes such as choosing chicken over lamb and beef. I also began being mindful of the amount of food I wasted and trying to avoid buying more than I eat. I stopped buying fast fashion and instead bought few clothes that lasted me for years rather than wearing clothes that broke after 2 washes. I continued living with my parents but when I moved out, I chose a modest studio apartment even when I could’ve afforded a larger, more expensive one. 
         <br><br>


However, there were many things that I didn’t do, things that left a horrible scar on the planet. Because of my work, I couldn’t have avoided airfare. It was not something I could have sacrificed in order to get to where I needed to be at in time. In doing so, I increased my carbon footprint by a lot. I also did not let go of my car. Even when I could’ve taken the train or subway, I loved my car too much to part ways. The Green New Deal wasn’t passed. The white house would not have allowed it to happen, the country wasn’t ready. Slowly things began slipping as the climate crisis class began to slip off my mind. I began to neglect my moral responsibilities and constantly give myself exceptions. Every time I did something environmentally conscious, I would justify it by saying “oh it’s only one time,” or “everyone else is doing it.” However, chances are, everyone was doing the same thing. It’s so easy to lose hope and focus, especially when it feels like you’re fighting against the whole world. 
         <br><br>


I begin to break a sweat as the air conditioning can no longer protect me from my misdeeds. There is a sweltering, deadly heat wave outside. The streets are melting and people are dying. The wealthiest sit and watch the poor suffer as they simply turn up their air conditioning, further contributing to the pollution of the environment. The ice caps are gone, leaving pathetic pieces of ice in its path.  I turn on the TV to see what’s on the news. It’s the usual: famine, death from previously extinct diseases, and warnings to wear face masks due to the unbreathable air. 

         <br><br>

The reason why I’m writing about such a negative view of the future is because I don’t want it to happen. Knowing myself, there is a large possibility that I will give up on trying to avert the climate crisis because I became paralyzed with despair and continued down the wrong path. However, when I get to 2060 and look outside my window, no matter how horrible everything turns out, I don’t want to feel regret or guilt. I want to know that I tried my best to save our planet, and the species.

A Letter to My Future Self:
         <br><br>


2020 has been a really tough year, the toughest year ever since the 2000s. Humans eventually paid off their debts because of the highly industrialized society and the consequent environmental catastrophe. Australia has suffered from its massive bushfires, causing hundreds and thousands of natural species to die or even become extinct. A lot of cities are having blood-red skies, which are reflected by the bushfire. I'm pretty sure that what's happening should be attributed to human actions like green-house effect followed by global warming, ocean-shore depletion, serious light pollution, water contamination, and a number of them are not mentioned. Meanwhile, the coronavirus transmission has been a big deal since day one but everybody isn't being aware until now, which is the time when the COVID-19 virus starts to make people panic. For this one, people are losing their lives, not just only animals. You can see how serious the situation is.
         <br><br>


A lot of scientists are claiming that it's quite possible that humans could become extinct in the near future if the climate crisis keeps happening and brings about countless disasters. However, there are people who are skeptical about this and still acting like they don't care about anything. As you can see, I would feel pessimistic about our situation some times.
         <br><br>


But, there is hope upon us. When I was enrolled in the course of English 23, I learned a lot about how we, as a whole, could possibly save our planet by our own actions. From now on, I will live a sustainable life and pass the hope to you.

         <br><br>

Sincerely,         <br><br>

Your Present Self

<p>

Dear my future self,          <br><br>

 I hope that you are still alive and the Earth is still sustainable for humanity when you open this message. This letter is for you in case you have forgotten a class that you took in college your freshman year. The topics may have seemed distant or far away from the comfortable life that you were experiencing in America, but I hope that this letter will help refresh your memory. Hopefully, by 2060, there will be a new mode of public transportation in the United States that does not release any greenhouse gases. I imagine that there might be automatic transportation by now and that life is far more advanced than what I can imagine in my head. If this is not the case, I hope that you have chosen to drive in an eco-friendly car. I care to remind you that, as of 2020, the average American emits 16 metric tons of CO2 per year. Your car, on average, is releasing 4.6 metric tons per year. I also hope that a more advanced mode of air travel has been invented or there is some new technology that enables an individual to go from one part of the world to another in the same amount of time without releasing any emissions. This is because studies in 2020 show that flying releases by far the most amount of CO2. Taking a plane from LA to Paris will release 3 metric tons of CO2. According to the Paris Accord, I can only release 2 metric tons of CO2 per year to prevent the global temperature rise to be below 2 degrees Celsius. Therefore, I hope that if planes do exist, that you still remember to fly less and embrace other modes of transportation when possible. If technology has not been able to advance to a point where you can travel without emitting any greenhouse gases, then I hope you are biking around. This will not only keep you healthy and you will be able to live longer, but also you will be helping the environment. 
         <br><br>
If consuming meat has not been limited or banned yet, I am sure that you are still eating meat. I sincerely hope that you have taken steps to eat healthier and have embraced a more plant-based diet because it is not only good for the environment but also your health. A 60-year-old man should not be consuming meat anymore. Please always be mindful to finish what you have on your plate and enjoy your meals. Food waste is a major problem right now in the United States and is a leading cause of emissions. In 2020, if we reduce food waste and switch to a plant-based diet, we could be reducing 173 gigatons of CO2 per year. That is mind-blowing, but realistically I believe that this will be very hard to achieve in our time and culture. Perhaps the culture in the future will be largely revolved around a plant-based diet, but I cannot say as of right now that things are looking up for food waste and plant-based diets. Another factor I learned in class is housing. I hope that you are living in a comfortable house that isn’t bigger than 3000 square feet. I know you will most likely embrace minimalism because it has also been a lifestyle that you admired and wished to achieve once you graduated so I am not worried about that. I hope that you had wonderful two children with a wife that also is engaged in caring for the environment. If you failed you have to do this, it is okay. There are many other actions you can take in the community to make an impact. 
         <br><br>
Collective actions are also very important and I hope that you have found friends and communities that are engaged in protecting the planet. If you chose to do law, then you should be very familiar with politics and how voting is important to making a difference. Please push yourself to go out and vote, and to tell other people who are younger than you the importance of voting. If you chose not to become a lawyer, it is still not a good excuse so go vote. Voting is the only way we can bring change to our culture in society, and I am sure that you know that. I also hope that you have found a community to keep you company and to motivate you to pursue an eco-friendly lifestyle. I find that having people around me that enjoy and do the same things is helpful for me to be more productive and to act. Perhaps you’ve already taken on gardening, but I really want to have my own garden so you better have already started one in the backyard.
         <br><br>
As of right now, I know that it is 2020 me who is responsible for making all of these changes in my life. I know that it will be hard and to be honest it might take me a few years or the rest of my college experience to really value the information I have learned in this class. Despite this, I have hope that humanity will be able to make changes that will prevent the Earth from nearing its 6th mass extinction. If I get to see this message again in 40 years, I know that we will all have at least done something right. As I close this letter I will continue living my life, learning more about myself, and discovering what I am passionate about. The future is a little scary, but to be honest this climate class has given me a better perspective of a future I would not have thought about. I would be concerned about my career, my friends, and my family. Not saying that these are not important for I will make sure that I cherish the time I have with them from now until 2060, but I can include the climate into my perspective for the future. It is scary to know that time passes by so quickly, and I know that if I do get to read this message that I will agree with my younger self that all the memories, good, sad, or bad have gone in a blink of an eye. I hope that I do not have too many regrets and continue to have the mindset to leave a happy and hopeful life. I hope that failing to prevent the climate crisis and failing to do my fault will not be one of my regrets in 40 years. 
         <br><br>
Sincerely, 
         <br><br>

Dear Future Self:

         <br><br>

Being a carnivore, primarily, throughout my entire life I know it is going to be hard to make the switch especially when things like vegetables make my insides queasy. If it has bread, meat, and cheese, then count me in. However, I truly hope that with time I’m able to make the change to a fully plant-based diet. As each day goes by, companies are getting that much closer to genetically engineering really tasty food that resembles meat. Even today, we have companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat that are already able to provide food that is close enough to meat, which allows millions of people to enjoy a “burger” without it being a true burger. As I start to think, maybe in order to get past my hard values of staying true to meat, I need to be forcefully tricked into eating products, or products similar to that of Beyond Meat and Impossible Food. 
         <br><br>


Even here in Santa Barbara, the lovely Portola Dining Commons offers an “Applegate Blend Burger” which I have enjoyed for several weeks. Well, turns out I really like mushrooms because that burger is 50% mushrooms and 50% beef. And maybe that’s what it is going to take. Small steps where I have and eat food options that are only a % meat so I can keep the taste and then eventually work my way to eating a strictly plant-based diet. Once I become best friends with vegetables I aspire to convince others who are on meat diets to make the transition. And if they are just as hard to convince as me, then, depending on which friend haha, change their juicy burger patty, with a succulent patty from beyond meat. From doing that, I hope the people I have convinced are able to introduce the plant-based diet to their friends and family so that way the number of people who are on plant-based diets can exponentially grow.



         <br><br>

What I’m most excited about from trying to make this change in my diet are all of the nutrients and essential vitamins that I’m going to be getting from the plant-based diet that I don’t normally get from my, predominantly, meat-based diet. I’m still a healthy person but I know that once I make the change I’m going to be in-taking a lot of things that I at one point was not getting from my meat-based diet. I’m sure as well that 20 or 30 years from now, engineered food is going to be so advanced that there’s going to be no real excuse to eat them. I also think it could be a good idea to make some sort of incentive similar to that of the carbon fee that was mentioned in “Be The Change”. It works hand and hand compared to the gas situation. If it gets to a point where you can’t even tell the difference in taste and you’re also benefiting from being paid, there’s no real reason to not indulge in the “fake” meat.

<p>
To my future children,
         <br><br>

I dearly apologize for my generation and how it has affected the world. Even though there is a lot of bad in the world ,I still believe that we can make a difference and improve our world. Any small action from reflecting on your actions or changing our diet can make a tremendous effect on the world. I was taking a Climate Crisis class back when I was in college and from there it has made a major impact in my life. It has open to all the possibilities in the world and how we can still make a change in the world.I also love how it emphasized that to love yourself and be happy with who you are and not with the material things that you buy. I would always focus on the American Dream but having the latest and greatest things never truly make you happy. You have to be happy with who you are as a person and how you live your life.
         <br><br>

I would always encourage to be an open-minded person because every day you learn something new in this world and knowledge is success. If you don’t know what to do or how to make a change,first and  foremost I would recommend to educate yourself with new things nad ways to make a difference in the world. A simple action can go a long way and being politically can help elect the perfect fit candidates to help improve our conditions that we are in.You are the future generation and I truly want the best for you and live the best life. I would recommend to reflect on your actions and ways you can improve the world. You never know what new skills you can get if you try new things and explore the world. There are always new things and so much to learn from the world. I'm roughly 60 years old,and yet there is still things that I need to know about the world and how I can make a change. No matter what age you are, there is always an opportunity to make a change and ways to improve your life. Now that I am older,I am able to be more involved politically and attend more political events. I want the best for you, my children and have the life that I always wanted.
         <br><br>

Throughout  my medical career, I helped people who are in need medically and educate them on what actions to take. I love to help others and make sure that they are satisfied with their health state.I Worked  a limited amount of hours since I want to make sure that I have time with my family and make sure that I am living a balanced life and living my life to the fullest. I want to make sure that I make a change and a difference to the world,so that the future generation does have to live a chaotic and miserable life.

To my future self:

         <br><br>

Its 2020, and still feels like the year has just begun, even though this year has been rather difficult thus far. The planet, as it has been in recent decades, is in an environmental crisis. Currently, however, our planet is in another kind of crisis as COVID-19 is spreading across the planet, somewhat in the early stages. Although I am interested to see how this crisis plays out and is handled as it becomes more and more serious, I already see a major difference in how COVID-19 is approached in comparison to the climate crisis. Currently, we have very little time to change the state of our environment. Because our environment has been deteriorating slowly, worsening significantly over the past 60 years, it is not taken seriously, by many people and by the government, specifically in the United States. Many people call climate change a hoax, despite immense amounts of research and evidence that our planet in is danger. Many choose to live in ignorance, or are aware of the dangers, but are unwilling to make any lifestyle changes in favor of environmentalism. I honestly do not see these people changing their minds in recent years, but I hope to see the 2020's bring positive change. The 2010's were filled with political turmoil and some pretty major societal changes through technological advancement, the popularization of social media, and the maturing of my generation into the beginnings of adulthood. Although I do not have much faith in those who live in ignorance of the climate crisis, I believe that young people are fighting to change that. I am proud of my generation and the political action I have seen since beginning college at UCSB. I could see big change happening when our generation utilizes its political power. We have all been witnesses to major issues in our country and seen their inability to face a compromise, specifically in gun control laws, as we were raised during a time when school shooter drills became a necessity. But we have seen some of the biggest disagreement over climate change. 

         <br><br>

Like many individuals, I was not aware of the climate crisis until late high school, and became more active in environmentalism upon joining college. I now feel like I have enough understanding of the issue to inform others on it, which I feel is one of the most influential actions one can take in order to make change, as mentioned in Ken's previous video. As for my own individual action, I have maintained a vegetarian diet for 6 years, limiting spending on fast fashion, put more focus on public transit in my every day life, and overall have attempted to use and throw away less, such as by using reusable drinking containers and silverware. I am proud of my contributions to the environmentalist movement, as I try to inform others as much as I can and was able to utilize my political power as a voter for the first time this year. But I wonder, is this enough? When I look back in 40 years, will I regret not doing more? Should I be joining coalitions and doing more activist work? I sincerely hope that I will not have such regrets in the future, but I do look at the next 40 years with uncertainty. Although I have taken these actions, I know that this may not be the case for the average person. I think that once we acknowledge how everyone can make change and show how environmentalism is accessible AND inexpensive, more change will come. In our society, however, climate change has been deemed a political issue, instead of a world issue. I notice that with COVID-19, as previously mentioned, our political leaders have stressed that this is a time of urgency and needing to work together by preventing the spread of this disease. People are taking less flights, avoiding leaving their homes, and stockpiling groceries and supplies. It is clear that we are in the middle of a crisis due to this disease. I wonder, however, what the results would be if people treated the climate crisis with the same severity. I look forward to seeing how this all plays out in the future, and I hope that I am doing enough to reach the future I want to see.



</p><hr>


<p>
It’s 2060 and you’re a young adult. I know we’re both lucky. I'm going to tell you a story about my childhood.
         <br><br>

My childhood was filled with swirls of people talking about “global warming” and “climate change,” although it took a few years before I truly understood. And when I did understand what was happening, it still didn’t seem to make sense. Throughout your life, the climate crisis has been common knowledge, dictating the world’s events and taught since you began school, as the history of our country and world. Although the scientists knew the severity of the problem, the public didn’t believe them. In the U.S., there were individuals and companies who effectively convinced everyone not to act. They were so powerful and had so much money, they were even able to control the government, something you know to be there to protect the public.
         <br><br>

And in 2016, when President Trump got elected, action towards solving the climate crisis stopped and action to further the climate crisis started. The President rolled back environmental protections and regulations, encouraged fossil fuel growth, and allowed corporations to control the land. I witnessed this all as I got my college education. That’s when my work started. I joined a student activism group, CALPIRG, and learned how to organize against these special interests. I campaigned for renewable energy, single use plastic reduction, decreasing the price of education, and registered young people to vote. I had hope that with other people, we could turn the tide in America.
         <br><br>

In 2020, we elected President Biden to office and took President Trump out of power. But Biden is not the focus here. The true focus is the millions of young people who started acting. During the Trump presidency, we started organizing. We took to the streets and protested the climate crisis inaction. We learned from each other and started fighting for the future we wanted. And then we started running for office. And we got elected. By 2030, the average age of Congress had dropped 20 years. Our new government took action. They started valuing people’s well being above profit.
         <br><br>

However, this transition didn’t come without pain. The polar ice caps melted because of the decades of delay, causing island countries and swaths of seaside land to be flooded. The migration of these people to other countries, who had lost their homes to the changing climate, was difficult, as people fought over resources and were slow to get rid of xenophobia. The polar ice caps melting released “super bugs” and millions died of disease. 
         <br><br>

But I’m glad we are where we are now. If we had not taken action, you and I would not be alive today. There is still more work to be done as we continue building our world to prioritize people instead of profit. Whatever you choose to do, I hope you appreciate the beauty of the world and all of its wonderful moments. It was not inevitable that you would be able to see them.

<p>
Today, we look at the world around us and can’t imagine living any differently. The air we breathe is clear and the water we drink is clean. Having found a way to live with our own planet in harmony, we turn our eyes to the stars, always learning, always searching. But I remember a time in my life when the future was uncertain. A time when many embraced cynicism and expected the worst from each other, and themselves. 
         <br><br>

When I was in college, the world began feeling some of the most destructive effects of climate change. In 2017, my alma mater, UCSB, ended the fall quarter early to allow students and faculty to evacuate the area. Sitting in the passenger seat while my friend drove us south toward home, I could see the ocean on our right and smouldering hillside to the left.The sky was yellow with smoke, and ash rained down like snowflakes. In July of 2019, over 160 people died from a heat wave that settled over Japan like a blanket. In August that same year a typhoon killed 172 people in China. As the world got warmer, mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and zika spread further north, inciting a panic that reached its peak in 2023. U.S. politicians were divided. Some emphasized the importance of action while others denied the real and present danger. 
         <br><br>

The election of Bernie Sanders in 2020 was the turning point. With his help, the Carbon Tax was put into effect in 2022, which led to a major shift in transportation in the United States. With like-minded people dominating the House and Senate, effective legislation was finally passed. At first, people were upset. But soon, with the help of nonprofits like the one I worked for, public transportation took over and individual cars soon became a thing of the past. It was a relief. I had never liked driving, never liked the probability of being in a serious car accident. Public transportation shifted quickly to renewable energy thanks to our tax dollars being put to good use. This change in transportation triggered a shift in our culture in a big way. 
         <br><br>

The U.S. began adopting many of the more successful work practices in Europe. In 2027 came the second amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which changed the national work week from 40 exhausting hours to a more reasonable 35 hours. Laws were passed to improve the lives of the working class, and the effects of this bottom up approach was felt by people across all classes. No longer was a single mother forced to work three jobs just to get by. No longer were the sick and injured forced to work through pain for fear of not having enough money for rent. As people were able to take more time to themselves, their attention began to shift to the climate. 
         <br><br>
I remember the death of the beef industry, which opened up land across the country for the reintroduction of native plant and animal life. I have always lived in cities, but the scenery of my train rides from California across the country changed drastically. Where in my youth I saw hundreds, thousands of grazing cows, I began to see trees. 
         <br><br>

The Safe Oceans Act of 2026 meant that companies dumping waste in bodies of water faced serious consequences, and in the following years millions of tonnes of plastic was removed from the world’s oceans. Unfortunately, the coral reefs which supported so much marine life still took a big hit due to the acidification of oceans around the globe. Thanks to federal funding, ocean-focused environmental groups were able to reintroduce many species of coral to reefs in Australia, Africa, and South and Central America. It is thanks to these groups that we are able to enjoy our oceans today.
         <br><br>

In some ways, my world became smaller. When air travel became infinitely more expensive, I stopped travelling across the country without careful consideration. I began growing my own food in our local gardens rather than eating food flown in from somewhere else. Tackling climate change was so much more than switching to electric vehicles. It took a change of culture, a shift in the very heart of our society. I am proud to be a part of the generation that took action.

March 2060         <br><br>


40 years ago it was 2020. I was 22 years old in my fourth year at UC Santa Barbara and getting ready to graduate college. 2020 was an especially transformative year in my life as Winter 2020 was my first quarter back from studying abroad in France in the Fall, there was the 2020 Presidential Election, and the Coronavirus Pandemic. I was having an eye-opening experience comparing different countries and their cultures that I had experienced while abroad to the United States, and the culminating influence to my critical analysis of the world, I credit to the Climate Crisis class I took with Professor Ken Hiltner that Winter quarter. It was the best (and most life-changing) class I took in college. 
         <br><br>

March 2020 was very surreal. The Coronavirus outbreak caused the last week of lectures, my finals and my last quarter at UCSB to go entirely online. I remember the weather was gloomy, morale was low, and the restructuring of our lives and responsibilities mirrored the consequences that followed the Thomas Fire and Mudslides my 2nd year at UCSB. These were natural disasters close to my home, but in a bigger sense, the Climate Crisis class reminded me that global temperatures rose, ice caps melted, sea-levels rose, hurricanes and wildfires became frequent, countries were flooding, people’s lives and homes destroyed and displaced, all throughout the last couple decades. It felt like the world was ending in 2020, and 40 more years ago (1980) we predicted this would happen and didn’t do much about it. 
         <br><br>

Many denied, either through ignorance, greed, or simply because they didn’t want to believe it and have their comfortable lives change, but humans caused these natural disasters. And disproportionately, Americans were to blame. And within America, the most privileged 1%. The 1% that decided to increase fossil fuel use, the 1% that kept money in their own pockets instead of sharing it with the public, the 1% that decided not to make sweeping changes for all humans and life on earth to live past their own individual lives. 
         <br><br>

In 2020, my generation knew revolutionary, systemic changes were needed to slow down and stop these natural disasters from ruining our planet. We knew that individual and collective action wasn’t enough, and political action was imperative. That’s why the 2020 Presidential Election was undeniably one of the biggest events that could change the course of the climate crisis. At the time, Democratic Candidate Bernie Sanders was the only candidate courageous enough to voice that positive outcomes are possible with radical change. In a similar response to the environmental crisis in the world, U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez famously stated, “We can be whatever we have the courage to see.” My generation, the younger generation, had the courage to face this life-changing global climate crisis head on and see the same future that Sanders was offering us to choose. He was our strongest hope in bringing the Green New Deal to life; replacing the unchecked capitalist economy in America with a democratic socialist economy in which resources were equally distributed among the public, and creating a world in which keeping our earth alive so humans and life on earth could continue for future generations.
         <br><br>

Alas, older adults and the 1% in power didn’t have the courage to see this. They played it safe and elected Joe Biden as the country’s Democratic Presidential Candidate. Ironically, Biden offered to go backwards, revert to how America used to work before the reign of Donald Trump. He was elected President of the United States in the last decade we had to turn our world around, literally, and this was the turning point in our history.
         <br><br>

Honestly, I’m quite surprised we’re still here in 2060, but life is nowhere near what life used to be in the early 2000’s. The political changes made by Biden’s administration to cut back America’s global greenhouse gas emissions took too long, and our environmental damages became irreversible. Throughout the last couple decades, parts of the world, like Bangladesh, Italy, and Florida, have permanently flooded and ceased to exist. There has been an unbelievable amount of human migration, which has spurred social havoc from overpopulation in many countries including the U.S. Wildfires and droughts were becoming so common in California that I decided to pick up my belongings and move. And yes, ships were able to sail directly over the North Pole by 2050. Much of the predictions that climate scientists warned us about in the first two decades of the 21st century came true, and we passed a point of no return and gave up peace and happiness for the world. 
         <br><br>

Having lived long enough to see the reality of the climate crisis, CEO’s of fossil fuel companies as well as major leaders of the climate crisis denial movement and lobby groups have gone on trial in the last decade for the spread of misinformation and jeopardizing the future of humanity. Some were convicted and faced a life-time sentence in prison, while many bought themselves out of being held accountable. Throughout these events, fossil fuel use has slowly been phasing out of industry, but we still have a long way until using only renewable energy sources.  
         <br><br>

Although my heart cries for the current status of the world and miss the place I was born and grew up in, I don’t regret my move to Denmark. When I decided to move out of California due to the wildfires, I saw this as an opportunity to do what I’ve always dreamed of doing since my time abroad. I made the choice to move to Europe, and Denmark in particular because of all the positive aspects of their society I learned in the Climate Crisis class I took in college. I’ve always had a fascination with Scandinavian countries, thinking they were some of the coolest countries in the world. At one point in my life, back when Bernie Sanders was campaigning, he helped me envision the United States changing to a similar society like Denmark and Sweden, a possibility for a transcontinental public train system, and a more educated populace who need not stress about their health. I was disheartened, but honestly more mournful of the United States that we as a country were so divided that we failed to save life on earth. For a while now, my values have aligned with those of the Nordic countries, and I observe America from afar. I still practice sustainable ways of living with my family, as well as take part in collective activism within my community. But knowing I have already lived over half my time here on earth, I just want to preach to my children my knowledge, have them keep alive the environmental awareness in our family, and continue to live a gentle and happy life.

Message from the future:         <br><br>

In the infamous year of 2020 was a wake-up call. In the first year of what many consider as the decade year of the 21st century, humanity saw and experienced first-hand the devastating consequences of climate change. That year made us all realize that our current way of living was simply unsustainable. Fires spread throughout Australia as the Covid 19 infected the whole globe. This made us realize that our encroachment of the wild and natural world did not go unnoticed and had deadly consequences. They were only one of many natural disasters that were made worse by climate change and our destructive habits. The rise in temperatures and CO2 allowed for wildfires to burn on scales uncontrollably. They’re scale and destruction set records and gave an ominous indication of what’s to come. Our encroachment on the natural world had apparent consequences. As people began living with wild animals rarely encountered in the past, diseases like covid 19 were allowed to spread to millions of people worldwide. The economic depression that followed the Russo-Saudi price war over oil made us all question our reliance on fossil fuels. At such a crucial time, rather than getting lost in the chaos, humanity came together and identified the source of all this suffering. The devastation of covid 19 and the collapse of the market demanded humankind to set aside our differences to survive.
         <br><br>
People began to recognize that the climate crisis was real and demanded action from everyone. Climate change was a no longer partisan issue as it began affecting the daily decisions of Democrats and Republicans alike. Things are more expensive today than they used to be so people buy less and that’s okay. Today, we buy most things locally and know exactly how they’re produced and where they’re made from. It’s hard to imagine that just 40 years ago, drinking milk from an industrial animal abusing farm and leaving the house wearing a shirt made from child labor was the norm. With the daily decisions of everyone changing, a cultural revolution followed. Eventually, the elected politicians became those who cared about the climate crisis. Identifying it to be a catastrophic threat, the government decided to act and passed an altered version of the green new deal. There was resistance. A lot of it. The green new deal was an ambitious plan that promised to radically transform the American economy and industries. People said that the economy wasn’t ready for such a radical transformation after the recession and the pandemic. Others said the national debt was too high to allow for such policies. However, despite all the pushback, the nation’s focus and commitment on climate change remained undeterred. Enough was enough. We decided that we were not going to stay idle as our habits continue to destroy the world. The change began to happen. First on a personal level, then national, then global. The whole world began to change. The empty sidewalks became filled with chattering pedestrians or cyclists while cars became rarer and rarer.
         <br><br>
Even though there has been a lot of changes over the past 40 years, not all of them were bad. The coral reef is a distant memory by now. In some places, you can still see the white shells and imagine the beauty of the colors they once had. Millions of miles of shoreline have been lost to the rising seas and many have been forced to move. The economic changes brought on by the green new deal were challenging and it lost a lot of momentum. However, we persevered through the tough times knowing that we had no other choice. It was either that or the Earth becoming uninhabitable. Even though it been tough, the Earth is worth saving.

We met while we were cooking on an electric stove (that didn’t always work) in a kitchen we shared with 1400 other people. I don’t remember what I was making. She was making soup. We were making conversation. She told me she always cooked in the kitchen because she was vegan, and the dining halls just didn’t have any good options. I wasn’t vegan, but I definitely agreed that the dining hall was no good. 
          <br><br>
Over the months, our passion for cooking brought us together, and I started cooking vegan things so we could share. We brought a couple different friends into our circle. We all started making food together, us making little changes in our diets so we could all try each other’s cooking. We took buses downtown and walked home at 1 am after concerts (mostly because it was cheaper than an uber, but we were saving the planet as we did it too). We biked to the beach together and laughed about the mess that Isla Vista was together, and how we couldn’t wait to spend all our time together here. We were a group of five, all from different cities and different backgrounds. We joked about looking like a college diversity advertisement.
         <br><br>

 We had fun making a change together. We cooked, hiked, biked, and made a mess while trying to help our planet. When we got to vote in the primaries for the first time, we filled out our ballots together and discussed our choices. We stuck our “I Voted!” stickers on our water bottles and smiled about it. We made fun of each other if one of us left the water on, and we taught each other our little facts about the environment. When we all graduated and moved to different places again, we all fixed the world in our own little ways. Habitat restoration, product development, urban planning, writing environmental policy, running a non-profit dedicated to sustainability. We kept in touch in our same group chat, sending each other songs, pictures, updates about where we were and what we were doing. We all used our dreams and aspirations to change what we could, and we watched our peers do the same. It was about doing what we loved, and channeling it the right way. It was about finding people we loved to change the world with. We found our reasons, made our plans, took our actions, and did everything we could, and got other people around us to do it too. It was a close call, but it was enough.

A message to those in 2060
          <br><br>

As you hear stories from the Gen Z generation and how we tried our best to stop the climate change: it is not completely true. To be honest, we could of done better. In my first year of college, I took ENG23 Climate Crisis, which fully outlined the issues of eating meat, driving cars, flying, and big companies releasing carbon emissions. Yet, all of this did not stop us. Some of us did try, though. We started eating healthier and tried to to be more environmentally conscious once in a while. Some of us became activists and pushed for legislation to protect the planet. However, most of us still did nothing. In 2020, people were still working for their own self interest. The COVID-19 panic would cause stores to run out of toilet paper and water in the US, as everyone scrambled for their own benefit. All of us still drove to get places, since it was most convenient. Although we knew what detrimental effects it would have, it was still the most convenient thing in front of us at the time. And when we saw the menus of our favorite restaurants, most of us didn’t think twice if it was vegan or locally sourced. Unfortunately, most of our generation did not act upon the knowledge we were provided, ironically becoming the same as the “Boomers” we once joked about. The only ones we can blame at this point is ourselves. With Greta Thunberg leading the climate crisis movement, we followed along loosely by reposting stories on Instagram and saying we wanted to do better, but never really tried.
          <br><br>

This is not to say that some of our generation tried very, very hard. There were those who were passionate about the planet. They knew just the same amount of information given to us by our teachers and the world, yet they wanted to make a change. They would become what we know as environmental activists, who actually implemented a healthy lifestyle and also wanted to make changes within the government and legislation to change how we treat carbon emissions. They tried really hard to make it work, but sadly, these huge companies did not like how loud we were. They did not want to be called out, and their money could make people be quiet. 
          <br><br>

Some of us, including myself, did not do enough. We fully knew what the repercussions were going to be, yet it was not real enough to cancel the once in a lifetime trip to Europe with family, or to switch transportation to work out of comfortability. We were too worried on our lives, afraid to debate with family members on the reality of climate crisis, afraid to get rid of our cars, until it was too late and we realized we did not have a life anymore. To you all, I say sorry.

Dear future self,
          <br><br>

It's you from the past. It's your second year of college, writing this letter from your small apartment in Isla Vista. Life's kinda weird right now-- we're in the age of a new era and a lot of things are happening. The political climate is extremely disheartening, there's humanitarian crises happening in the world, and the planet is slowly dying. All that is quite a lot to take in-- how do you navigate this as a college student? Taking English 22 and 23 has taught you that anyone can take steps to mitigate the climate crisis despite their circumstances. As a college student, you were able to adapt changes into your lifestyle by reducing your food waste, relying more on public transit, and educating others on how they can also make a difference. You also are politically active and will be voting in the presidential election for the first time ever (yay!!). 
          <br><br>

But despite how dire circumstances may seem, there are great things coming. You're in the middle of a historical moment-- people your age and the youth are the ones creating change. Their political activity is inspiring and will create a framework for the future. I hope that their actions have shaped all the events that led up to 2060 in a positive way-- I hope that in the world that you are living in, there is a genuine care for the earth and other human beings.

<p>

To my past self,

          <br><br>

The year was 2020 when things were unclear in a lot of aspects in your life. You had so much fear when it came to the climate crisis, the political climate, and in your personal life as you worried about being able to finish your bachelors of science degree in chemistry. In your second year at UCSB you decided to take English 22 and 23, which at first were just general education requirements that seemed more interesting than courses like museum studies. The classes turned out to much more meaningful than you originally imagined and drove you to consider more than just the scientific side of the climate crisis. Now, writing from the year 2060 I am here to tell you that while it was not immediate or easy by any means, things have turned out to be alright. Here’s how the past forty years have gone… 
          <br><br>


Despite your concerns that Bernie would not win the democratic nomination after the disappointing results of Super Tuesday, he was able to continue with the race and eventually got enough delegates to defeat Joe Biden. On the nerve wracking date of November 3, 2020 you cast your ballot for Bernie Sanders. After the long wait to hear results you burst into tears of happiness as you would not have to see another four years of the previous president, a name that we no longer like to even use as that period of presidency was a true disgrace in American history. Your friends would no longer have fears about being deported and you could rest easy knowing that you finally had a president that not only acknowledged the severity of the climate crisis, but actually had a plan to combat it. You knew that the fight was far from being won, but this small victory was the catalyst that would spark a reaction across the world.

          <br><br>

Change was painstakingly slow and did not come without opposition from skeptics and people profiting from the destruction of our planet. The people who had gotten the earth hooked on fossil fuels in the first place were not ready to go down without a fight. But eventually fossil fuel giants fell and in their place renewable energy sources became the new norm. One of the first major changes that was made was converting all public transportation to be powered by renewables. Along this line bike infrastructure was also put in place. These two sweeping actions reduced car use drastically and created new jobs. While some deniers, and the wealthy, still continued to drive and fly a carbon tax that increased the price of flights and gas caused another drop in transportation emissions. Over time more and more changes were made and not only were emissions dropping significantly but to many people’s surprise levels of happiness were rising. 
          <br><br>


Despite people’s fear that The Green New Deal would mean giving up everything that they have worked so hard to earn, many people have actually gained a great appreciation for living with less. With less people traveling for work due to the increase of teleconferencing people are spending more time with their loved ones. More and more people were starting to garden either in their own backyards or in community gardens. With a greater appreciation for spending time outdoors and eating food they had grown themselves people were made happier through these gardens. People also began consuming less unnecessary goods which lowered the emissions associated with production and led people to fill the need to buy with more fulfilling hobbies. 

          <br><br>

The Green New Deal really made all the difference as it was such a widespread resolution that looked at the climate crisis as a holistic issue that requires a holistic solution. Laws were passed regarding several issues. One of the first laws passed was to stop the unnecessary food waste being produced by grocery stores and restaurants. Owners of these establishments were forced to take action by mainly donating their “bad” food to homeless shelters. This both eliminated methane emissions that would have come from the food rotting in landfills and helped to feed people in tough situations. Although we did not reach the point of no return, extreme weather events did continue to happen. There were terrible hurricanes and wildfires, but there were also plans put in place to deal with these disasters, as well as government funding thanks to The Green New Deal. 

          <br><br>

While obviously much less important than the fate of the universe, I also just wanted to briefly mention how your personal life turned out. While your path to earn a chemistry degree was tough at times and required a lot of determination you did not give up because your passion for chemistry never faltered. You enjoyed the rest of your time at UCSB as you participated in research, continued to help with the 5th grade chemistry outreach program, and made time to surf with your friends as well. You spent many years working at a police department where you were a forensic scientist and helped people get the justice they deserved using science. As a hobby you are now working to develop more sustainable practices in chemistry because despite there already being a large improvement since your time in college, innovation is always welcome. You live in a small apartment with your husband and pet dachshund who you love dearly. Most importantly you are healthy, happy, and proud of what you have overcome and accomplished so far in your life. 

          <br><br>

Today as you walk around your community you see something much different from what you grew up knowing California to be, but the change is much more positive than negative. There is more greenery and more bikes and even possibly more smiles. 2020 was a defining year for the fate of our planet, and thankfully we took the right steps towards mitigating the climate crisis. It is easy to imagine how things could have gone wrong but I hope that you do not dwell on these possibilities and instead focus your energy on making a difference. There is still work to be done, and there always will be, but do not lose hope because when the masses are willing to protest and fight to get what we deserve from our politicians then change can be made. Never lose sight of how important it is to fight for what you believe in. Always fight with passion for environmental and social justice because those are causes entirely worthy of our efforts. 


Sincerely,          <br><br>

Your future self

<p>
A message from the future:

          <br><br>

I can remember the year 2020, when I was a junior in college, hopeful that Bernie Sanders– the most progressive democrat– would win the presidency. I can remember my disappointment when Joe Biden was taking the lead in the nomination– unfortunately for my high hopes, it became obvious that the weakest moderate democrat would win. Even though I did not stand by Biden– I campaigned for him in the months to come so that we could ensure getting former president Trump out of office. Even in my disappointment, I tried to fight for what I believed in. The young people in the country grew sick and tired of the injustices that fuelled the US– from the gross negligence of the fossil fuel corporations, the appalling treatment of immigrants and climate/war refugees, the government's open rejection of universal healthcare initiatives as pandemics became all the more frequent– we lead marches through the streets of every major town, young voters flooded the polls, people began actively dispelling information to the broader public that would shift public opinion. Biden won the presidency in 2020 as a result of this action. While his platform was almost as conservative as the former presidents, the people power spurred the house and senate (both also with democrat majority) to produce progressive bills which Biden was inclined to sign. On a bright note, he re-instated the US into the 2016 Paris Accord agreement. 

          <br><br>

He was in office for eight (surprising) years, and in that time the US slowly began divesting from fossil fuels (painfully slowly), the supreme court flipped to democrat, and the US made a commitment to reducing food waste and 75% renewable energy by 2050. Things were looking better than before. Even more shockingly, the next term was filled by a moderate republican– I am blanking on the name right now, but even he didn't shake things up too bad. He believed in climate change and while he didn't strive to make any changes, he didn't unravel previous work that had been done; especially after Hurricane Karen the most devastating hurricane to hit the southeastern US, reaching into Missouri. Most of his term was spent sorting out how to handle population movement away from coastal areas, climate refugees, and immigrants from around the globe. 
          <br><br>


It took more work that it should have– growing up, I always thought that the government wanted what was best for it's citizens, that was an ideal that was proved wrong throughout my late teens and twenties– we as citizens had to work incredibly hard to get what we wanted. In 2031, I was 32 years old and helping to run an urban community garden in LA when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was running for president, I had never campaigned harder for someone in my life. She was a personal hero of mine, always fighting for what she thought was right! Her platform was based on climate action, social justice, universal healthcare, student debt forgiveness, renewable energy, etc– all of the things me and my fellow citizens had been fighting for. When she won, I cried. We deserved her, she deserved our support. 
          <br><br>


With AOC in office, and congress majority democrat, we finally started getting things done. 2032, far later than we needed, but we worked with what we had. By this time, our CO2 allotment was nearly up– thanks to the tireless efforts of nearly every other developed country and the lack-luster efforts of ours, we hadn't completely boofed it. AOC and her VP Ilhan Omar took the nation by the reigns, with swift, well thought out executive orders that, in essence, were taken right out of the Green New Deal (market based policy that would underpin the pursuit of the proposals in the GND were completed in 2027 but most were never put into action). New legislation came rushing from the doors of congress and was just as quickly implemented. These were exciting and rough times– full of political and social unrest but fuelled by the decades-long public outcry for government intervention. Though met with vehement opposition in the beginning of her term, AOC implemented those policy changes and soon many people realized that their needs would be taken care of– the legislation being passed took special care to make sure no one was being left out of the equation. Most citizens grew to be more content, happier even (as seen by the measurement of a nations success–instead of GDP, a scale based on happiness was put in place in 2033).

          <br><br>

There was a huge demand for workers in careers we once called "green-jobs" that are now very mainstream jobs, like renewable energy, habitat restoration, landfill mining, large composting facilities, public transportation design/construction, and the like. People that were negatively affected by the transition away from fossil fuels were able to find jobs and be re-educated thanks to government programs. Big cities incentivized people to move into both smaller apartments and co-housing units. The carbon tax (2037, AOC's second term) and more access to public transportation lead people away from car usage. As of 2039, 23 of the US largest cities were connected via train, 18 of those 23 cities had completed public rail or subway systems.

          <br><br>

As of 2040, the US was one of the many nations close to carbon neutrality. Life has slowed down a lot since I was 20, the work week shifted from five to four days, people were biking to work and school, people began living with their families and extended families, traveling became about a journey rather than a destination... Things were better. Political battles were soon over issues like which programs should be getting more funding and taxes– issues that were from my childhood when life was "normal". This new way of life is "normal". Somehow, as the existential crisis of my generation is in the rear view mirror, everything has changed, but it all suddenly feels like it is back to normal. Things are different, not everything is perfect, we are still dealing with things like the storms, the plethora of issues with the oceans, push back from fringe conservatives (those who still do not believe in anthropogenic climate change), and immigration issues because of the changes in the climate.

In related news, human population stabalized at around 9.3 billion people in 2048 as a result of women education and empowerment campaigns that swept through first Europe and then Asia, Africa and finally the Americas. The Total Fertility Rate has recently (2057) become 1.9, which is below replacement and we expect a slow decline in population as time goes on. 

          <br><br>

I rest easy now, as a 61 year old knowing that these are things that can be sorted out. Thanks to the efforts of my fellow people, we changed the course of planetary history. There were so many times that I felt as though I had lost hope for good, but I always found it again. They used to say that nothing good comes easy, I know it to be true. Never stop fighting for what you believe in.

 I envisioned a similar future for the outcome of the climate crisis. 
          <br><br>
The Anthropocene had been previously defined by the dominance of human influence on the environment that resulted in a series of multiscalar issues known as the climate crisis. According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a dire need for urgent, unprecedented, and collective action to cap global warming at 2°C by 2050 through reductions in carbon emissions was deemed necessary to successfully mitigate the effects of climate change. Prior to his election, Bernie Sanders promised to implement strategies proposed in the Green New Deal by taking actions necessary to mitigate climate change while also providing opportunities for economic growth and social justice. 
          <br><br>

In order to limit global warming to 2°C, President Sanders demanded a shift in our economy towards energy efficiency and decarbonization that involved a rapid transition away from fossil fuels as an energy source altogether. Under Sanders, reconstruction mitigation relied on a multipronged approach that expanded renewable energy sources throughout national infrastructures and financed innovations that improved energy efficiency. 
          <br><br>

To catalyze innovation and mandate this transition, a combination of economic incentives and strict environmental regulations proposed by Sanders forced industries to adapt. Because industries were forced to comply with these restrictions, companies began investing in innovations to increase commercial competitiveness. Further, by incorporating the costs of ecosystem services into new products, industries induced more cautious use of resources which prevented skyrocketing rates of consumption. 
          <br><br>
  
This dramatic economic shift didn’t come at a cost to the livelihoods of the public by resulting in widespread unemployment or loss of industry like many feared prior to Sanders’ election. As president of the United States, Bernie Sanders prioritized the mindfulness of social justice concerns by protecting jobs and providing opportunities to adapt and thrive in a changing economy. The Green New Deal fully accounted for individuals and families by guaranteeing jobs, public employment, career training, and universal healthcare. Those working in fossil fuel reliant industries underwent a transition to careers in sustainable industries and new industries arose which spread technological innovations. Those still in need of jobs found careers in renewable energy reliant businesses and gained the necessary skills to adapt through educational opportunities and occupational training. 
          <br><br>

Ultimately, President Sanders became known as the politician that changed the outcome of the climate crisis by spearheading a social and economic centered environmental revolution for one of the world’s (previously) leading greenhouse gas emitting countries.

40 years ago, I attended a course called climate crisis and it changed my viewpoint against the seriousness of global warming completely. 
          <br><br>
Before this course, climate crisis is a vague concept in my mind. It is certainly a real thing, since that most leaders of the countries agreed to this fact and made an effort to curb it from getting worse. However, I didn’t think that this is a serious issue. At least it’s not as urgent as what I should have for the next meal. And, there’s another underlying reason behind my failure to pay more attention to this problem, which is because certain countries are using this issue to play politics and use this as an excuse to curb the speed of development in other countries.
          <br><br>

As I went through the lectures, I got more information about how the situation is  developed over a short period of time, and why global warming is worth more attention. Something else  happened over the course. Something seemingly irrelevant. Certain forest fires took place in multiple countries such as Brazil and Australia which seemed quite serious and wasn’t controlled in a short period of time. Several forest fires took place in California, one of them even caused the campus to shut down for a day. Later on, a certain virus started spreading quietly from the center of China, Wuhan and then quickly affected the whole country. Companies are shut down and shelves in stores are empty. Soon after that, the whole world is declared to be in a state of emergency.
          <br><br>

But are they really irrelevant? The topic of my course and all these terrible stuff happened? Later on it proved not. They are all caused by the increase in temperature around the globe. I came to a realization that I need to act and act now to stop or at least slow the process of global warming. The first thing I do is that I changed my focus into public health in order to help cope with the possible spread of epidemic in the future. Apart from studying for my career, I volunteered in the education of children especially girls in South Asia countries. We made a lot of progress and not only the mortality of mothers when giving birth and unintended pregnancy is lowered largely, but the girls are respected by their family members after the education and felt more satisfied with the family they ended up with. 
          <br><br>

Around the globe, more world leaders started to respond to act upon the issue of global warming. They sat down and analyzed the feasibility of the Green New Deal and came up with a consensus in 2030. At that time, the shared community became a popular idea because it saves time for people, especially young parents, who can focus on their work without worrying about if their children are well taken care of. The birth rate in most countries has decreased to around 1.5. But the advancement in technology made up for the loss in labor.

A message to the future:

          <br><br>

I have been called a dreamer since I was a child. Both my parents would say I’d stare off into space suddenly and be lost in my thoughts. I’d create impossible worlds in which my own rules and dreams would take shape. I’d take what displeased me in reality and make it beautiful in fantasy. Despite nearly two decades in the American public education system I am proud to say it is a habit that I did not lose. There is nothing more important than imagination and there is nothing that could parallel imagination with incentive and innovation.

          <br><br>

Think about it, human innovations such as flying, building skyscrapers, engineering prosthetics as well as poems, art and literature are all products of human innovation. The will to survive, adrenaline, aspirations and goals are all the essensence of what makes up humanity. We humans have already proven we can overcome any obstacle and become whatever we want to be. We truly are a beautiful species coming from all cultures, backgrounds, shapes and sizes. However when ambition turns into greed and when that greed turns into carelessness we lose sight of what is important. We buried ourselves with overwhelming problems; overpopulation, war, disease and bigotry and perhaps the biggest of all the climate crisis. 
          <br><br>
The Climate Crisis or Global Warming was on track to create large, irreversible and devastating damage to the planet. Much of human society; food, transportation and housing, was built on the burning of fossil fuels which released greenhouse gases such as CO2 and methane. These gases caused the Earth’s surface, ocean and atmosphere temperature to rise astronomically in a short 60 years. Although many people, mainly those who endorsed fossil fuel industries, denied the climate crisis and even worse. They tried convincing other people that the whole thing was a hoax, as if 93% of all the scientists in the world could create such a conspiracy. As if these people could fake the polar ice caps melting, force entire species to migrate, fake miles of dead coral reefs or severe natural disasters. After 60 years of denial, my generation decided to stand up to the decades of cynicism. 
          <br><br>
In the year 2020, millions of people from all over the world took it upon themselves to reverse the Climate Crisis. We took inspiration from the past generations who created the lightbulb, rocket ships, antibiotics and created new technological solutions to the problems we faced. Every single human took personal action by consuming less beef, which was producing methane gas that was devastating the planet. Every single person took a pledge to only travel through public transportation which was cutting edge and built by the government. Every American who was able to, voted for a president who took it upon himself to spearhead America into a New Green Era. Everyone united to take down corporations who were damaging the planet as well as exploiting thousands of workers. Green once more stood for the environment and not for American currency. The American Dream became the Dream of the Planet which you might know as a philosophy in which the individual’s happiness is deeply imbedded in the safekeeping of Mother Earth and all her wonder. 
          <br><br>
I am proud to say it was my generation who solved the biggest problem that ever faced humanity. We returned to our primal instincts to nurture and to move forward in order to solve the problem we created ourselves.
          <br><br>
All this could never have happened without a little imagination and innovation plus the incentive to act.

To my future self,           <br><br>

I hope this finds you well in less stressful times than what you’ve experienced in your first year of college.  I hope you’re happy and health as well as your loved ones.  I hope you’ve found your place in the world and a home that keeps you safe.  
          <br><br>


I hope the world around you is no longer on the verge of dying.  At this place in time that I am witting to you, the world faces its greatest challenge yet: the climate crisis.  For much of your young adult life, this imminent disaster has been disputed among legislators and politicians alike for decades; therefore bringing doubt about the validity of global warming claims.  This has divided the current world’s society between those who believe in anthropogenic climate change and those who don’t believe in anthropogenic climate change.  A divide that has rendered our government’s ability to mitigate the effects of climate change and even begin the steps to save our planet as almost useless.  Scientists have given us the numbers and projections for a bleak future that is to come for us if we do not change our lifestyles and how we treat our environment.  Following the end of 2019, we saw the proposal known as the Green New Deal grace the political scene for environmental legislation.  To be on trend, the GND is also very disputed in the United States as whether it’s a practical plan for mitigating anthropogenic climate change.  At 18 years old, you saw a lot of flaws in the GND, you didn’t think it had a chance of getting passed as legislation in a political climate dominated by the restlessness of conservative Americans and the antics of POTUS Donald Trump.  You wondered about the countless issues that would arise by cutting out the use of fossil fuels from industry completely.  Where the money, property, and job opportunities would come from to supply the citizens that demanded them in the GND’s proposal “to create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States.”  Regardless of what you thought about the GND at 18, I hope the US government has set their divisions aside to come up with solutions to secure the habitability of the earth for future generations.  (I also hope you guys have elected a president you’ve come to admire in the future.)

          <br><br>

I hope you’ve found ways yourself to mitigate the climate crisis in your everyday life.  That you’ve taught your kids how to ride bikes where you didn’t learn until the summer before you went off to college.  I hope you still drink almond milk every day and have completely cut out meat in your diet since I know you were never that fond of the taste of meat anyways.  The biomass will thank you as well as the reduced methane emissions that usually come from the meat-packing industry.  It’s torture what they do to those animals.  I learned about this really cool thing called thrifting in college and I hope it’s something you’ve continued through adulthood or at least minimizing the clothes you buy and discard a year.  The CO2 gas emissions that came from the fast fashion industry and the inhumane working conditions they imparted on their employees were horrid when you were in college; I pray they no longer have that same effect on the environment and the citizens of developing countries.  

          <br><br>

Right now I’m 18 and very close to being in love, so as I write this letter to you as a hopeless romantic, I hope you’re happily married to the guy of our dreams with no more than two children (population-control) and that you two are raising the happiest and well-adjusted children our families have seen.  I hope you’ve instilled in them the importance of being mindful of your surroundings and the power they have in their hands to make a change in the world the way our generation has.  Our children will be the ones to continue the fight for the health of our planet and the survival of our culture and traditions.  Take care of yourself and remember to enjoy the beautiful moments of your life.  I hope I’ve made you proud.

To kids,
          <br><br>

40 years ago, I was a freshman in college, and I had the opportunity to take one of the most interesting classes offered at UC Santa Barbara - a class solely about the climate crisis, which was one of the most pressing issues for our world at that time. Today, in the year 2060, we can look back and see that 2020 was a pivotal year for the United States and our world. It was a turning point in the climate crisis.
          <br><br>

Although there was progress prior to 2020, on an individual level for many people, and lots of knowledge being shared, it took the 2020 election to really spur action at the national and global level. The Green New Deal was central to the platform of the newly elected president. The policy plans of the Green New Deal included instituting a carbon fee and dividend, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, investing in and expanding renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal, investing in regenerative and sustainable agriculture, ensuring justice for vulnerable communities, and other specific environmental policies. The United States, being a world leader, set an example for other nations by implementing and standing by the promises of the Green New Deal.
          <br><br>

At first, many Americans were skeptical about the Green New Deal, thinking that their jobs or ways of life would need to be sacrificed. However, once they began to receive dividends (checks sent directly to them) from the carbon fee, and realized they had the guaranteed support of job training, housing assistance, and health care, they slowly but surely got on board with the national transformation. The carbon fee and dividend proved to be a super successful and efficient solution to moving away from fossil fuels, and corrected the market failure. Through new legislation, fossil fuel subsidies were eliminated. Over the years, we invested in environmentally friendly infrastructure - high-speed rails were expanded, and many more solar panels and wind turbines were put in place all over the country. 
          <br><br>

But more than just changes in our legislation, infrastructure, and economy - we changed our attitude and our culture, as Americans. For most of America’s history, the culture was one of consumerism, and one of displaying success through wealth and material items. It was a culture that only knew fast, mass production of food and other goods. Over these last two decades, with the new generations coming of age and spreading their knowledge and passion for the environment, our culture really has shifted. Without a culture and attitude shift regarding the environment, our progress and the Green New Deal could not have been achieved.

In 2020, I was in my second year in college at UCSB. I decided to take a course called "The Climate Crisis" because I needed general education credit, and I had always been interested in how to help save the planet. Before taking the class, I was fully vegan, I recycled, composted, reused, shopped second hand for almost everything, and biked everywhere in Isla Vista instead of owning a car. This class touched on things I already knew, but also opened my eyes to what I needed to change.
          <br><br>
Immediately after that class I became more aware of the world around me. I am still vegan, and so is my whole family. I stopped flying except for a big vacation every couple of years. I became more active in local politics, and researched local politicians before voting. I encouraged friends and family to vote and offered to break down their ballot for them. I have never bought my own car, but I do own a Vespa that I take when I cannot use public transportation. If I am going somewhere far, I carpool with a friend. I decided to adopt instead of have kids and there are solar panels on the co-op that we live in. I informed my friends and family around me about the crisis we were in and I became active in activist networks in the Santa Barbara county. I did the best I could. This was not enough.
          <br><br>
It is the year 2060, I am 60 years old. The Climate Crisis has become more of a class issue than it ever has been before. Thankfully, my family makes middle class income and lives in America. The middle class? They are doing... okay. They can afford higher air conditioning bills and high gas and food prices. The top one percent can afford to migrate north where it is cooler after their house burns down. They continue to drive their multiple cars because they can pay for gas. They continue to eat red meat because their own pleasure is more important to them than the lives of those around them. The lower and under class are not so lucky. Deaths from natural disasters (wildfires, hurricanes etc) have risen exponentially. Poor air quality means that most people I know suffer from a cough. It is dangerous to be a field worker, deaths from heat exhaustion have risen too. The poor cannot afford to migrate north, they suffer the horrible conditions of being stuck in slums. Africa and the Middle East are becoming less populated due to migration (for those who can afford it) and death due to droughts, which affects food production as well. Diseases deadlier than the Corona Virus have wiped out a majority of the older population as well as immune-suppressed folks.
          <br><br>
Our Earth? She is hanging in there. Miami and New Orleans are under water, I never got to visit either one. Coastlines are constantly eroding. Snorkeling is a thing of the past, many beautiful fish have gone extinct as well as colorful coral. The coral that is left is white and bleached. More and more ice is melting at the poles, releasing more unknown diseases into the atmosphere.
          <br><br>
Last but not least, we are at war. A Civil War. The war is over oil, of course. The Green New Deal was never enacted. Police roam the streets every night and monitor how much we buy (everyone has food stamps). The crime rate is at an all-time high. Everyone in the U.S. has a curfew from 12am to 5am. The war is not in my backyard, it is on the east coast. But I will feel the effects of this soon, because I know both of my sons will get drafted.
          <br><br>
Who's fault is this? Not all of ours. I did what I could, and my friends did what they could. Politicians kept brainwashing a majority of the population and this resulted in inaction. Big Oil companies were greedy and selfish, and so were the top one percent. Middle class folks experienced detachment from these issues, because the issues weren't right in front of them. It is the bourgeoisie's fault. The rich had no sense of compassion for the poor and have indirectly caused deaths because of this. It is going to get worse. This crisis is not over.

Dear Future Children/Child,
          <br><br>


I’m currently writing to you from my small triple in the residence halls of UC Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara is a place which has experienced the climate crisis first hand. In the short time that I have been in college, I’ve already witnessed a fire which engulfed an entire hillside just a short distance away. A few years prior, a massive fire threatened the city of Santa Barbara, along with UCSB itself. Fires are now a reality that we Californians have to adapt to because the climate crisis has destroyed the world that we live in. It will continue to destroy our environment if we don’t enact social change.

          <br><br>

Our world is in desperate need of change, and it needs your help! I hope that my generation has made enough of a contribution to keep our environment habitable, but now it’s up to you. Humans have emitted so much CO2 into the atmosphere, and it’s destroying our environment. Because the US is such a dominating force, it is imperative for the US to set a good example for other countries around the world. You can help accomplish this goal!
          <br><br>


As an individual, you can make many changes that will benefit our climate. Although it may not seem like you’re making an impact, believe me, you are. I have experienced first hand, the detrimental impact of the climate crisis, and I don’t want you to see the devastating events that I have seen. You may ask, how do I help? Well, here it is: 1) minimize food waste, 2) eat as a climatarian, 3) limit family size, 4) walk, bike, or use public transportation, 5) live in smaller home, 6) don’t fly, 7) buy less stuff, 8) borrow, repair, or exchange, 9) vote, and 10) tell your friends to vote! This may seem like asking for a lot, but desperate times require desperate change.

          <br><br>

When it comes to voting, it’s probably the most important action that you can take. It only takes an hour or two every year to educate yourself on all of the candidates and all of the propositions. Vote for candidates who put people and the planet ahead of corporate interests. Educate yourself and educate others. This is the way to enact social change.

          <br><br>

Love,          <br><br>

Mom

<p>

The year is 2020, and I am here writing to my future self. By the time you read this, it’ll be 2060, and I hope with my whole heart you are leading a beautiful, fulfilling life, but more importantly in terms of this time capsule of sorts, I hope we get our act together and solve this climate crisis. I am writing to you on March 15th, the day this last homework assignment for English 23: The Climate Crisis is due.
          <br><br>

2020 thus far has been quite the rollercoaster. I came into it full of hope and motivation, but as I sit here in my bed, writing my final comment, those feelings are hard to reproduce. We started the year off with Australia’s horrific wildfires, and now here we are living through just the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Just yesterday, UCSB students received Chancellor Yang’s update email on COVID-19, transitioning all of Spring quarter to remote instruction, and strongly encouraging students living on-campus to stay home the whole quarter. I know this decision is in our best interest, but it has been hard to come to terms with the fact that we won’t be returning next quarter. However, we will make the best of the situation, all the while practicing social distancing and self-isolation. 
          <br><br>

On a more hopeful note, the rest of this time capsule will be dedicated to what I hope happens in the future, and where I hope the world is in 2060, in terms of climate change. As far as personal actions go, I have many goals I hope to accomplish. This class has taught me so much, and has helped me realize that my own individual actions do play a role in mitigating this crisis. I have already made the decision that I will no longer contribute to fast fashion, by voting with my dollar and only buying clothes from second hand stores and thrift stores. I am already vegetarian, but I hope that in the next few years, I can shift that to being vegan, but more importantly climatarian, meaning I will buy in season and locally. I plan on using more public transportation, and even better my bike, and eventually, live in a city that has climate change in mind as far city planning and development goes, where walking is the main form of transport. I plan on living mindfully, meaning I won’t buy an unnecessarily huge house, nor will I live in a way where I measure my success through material wealth. I will practice minimalism in one form or another and will try my best to buy from companies with environmentally-sound and socially just practices. Finally, I hope to cut my flying down, and participate more in slow travel, in order to cut down on my climate footprint. I have big plans and expectations for my future self, but this will be a way to hold myself accountable. 
          <br><br>

Now, onto the bigger picture: politics. In November, we have the presidential elections that could change everything. This past month, I voted for the first time. Although it is looking a bit difficult for now, if everything goes swimmingly, Bernie Sanders will be elected president. However, I doubt Democrats will hold the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, which will make it hard for Bernie to implement the Green New Deal, as Republicans fear for tax raises. He will however, repeal many of Trump’s policies, and will sign the United States back in the Paris Accord. By 2022, voter turnout will be higher than ever, and the Democrats will take back control of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Green New Deal will finally be signed into law, although taking a while to be fully implemented into American society.
          <br><br>

As a society, I simply hope we quickly realize the urgency of this situation. This is bigger than anything we’ve ever encountered as a species, and drastic measures must be taken now in order to save Mother Nature and everything she’s provided for us. In 2060, I hope we have gotten the situation under control, not only for ourselves, but for all the other species who we share this planet with, that have done nothing to deserve any of this. I hope biodiversity is restored, the coral reefs bounce back, the ice caps stop melting, sea animals stop dying as a result of human actions. The list goes on. I hope by 2060, ideally earlier, I can look to the future optimistically. As AOC once said, “We can be whatever we have the courage to see”.

<p>

Dear my daughter/son:

          <br><br>

This is a letter from your mom writing in 2020. Hopefully, you are doing well these days. Probably, you are growing in a bad environment with a lot of pollution, and mom feel so sorry about that because our generation did not take an effective action to protect our planet. Although at the same time there are sunshine and flowers in this world, you are breathing dirty air every day because of materialism of my generation and past few generations.
          <br><br>


In my generation, we are using iPhone 11 now. Digital devices developed so fast these years. We are addictive to those fantastic technologies. We use electricity to support our daily life. We drive private cars to school and work. Due to the development of fast fashion, I always buy clothes and unnecessary stuff. I also travel by air with my friends sometimes. However, because of these behaviors, we overexploit fossil fuels, resulting in many greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are released to the atmosphere. Actually, some of us realized that we should make a change, but effort by only a few people is not enough. Some countries sighed Paris Agreement to limit the temperature growth under two degrees Celsius. Nonetheless, I do not think that we could achieve that goal since the temperature is growing rapidly. You will know the result though.

          <br><br>

Some parents work very hard and earn a lot of money for their children. They will buy their kids beautiful clothes and best toys, and provide them with highest level of living quality as possible as they can. Nevertheless, I will not buy you a lot. I will buy something that are necessary. But I promise, I will provide you with happiness. Our happiness will not come from material possessions. I promise, your dad and I will love you forever. We will spend as much time as possible with you, and provide you with a carefree childhood. Also, we will travel once a year. However, we are not going to travel by air because traveling by air will cause a large amount of climate footprint.
          <br><br>


My dear kid, our earth is sick, and we are trying our best to heal it. You may feel lonely sometimes because you are the single child in our family. I can not bring you a sister or a brother because the population is so large that recourses on the Earth can not support that much people. You may find it inconvenience to use public transportation or ride a bicycle every day to school, but driving private cars will cause a lot of emission of greenhouse gases. I believe there will be more subway lines in China and you will enjoy. Besides, I have been giving up eating meat and became a vegetarian for many years. The process is super difficult, but I am happy that I am helping our planet. You may feel tedious to just have plant based diet, but it is good for your health as well as the environment. Probably, you think our house is small and you only a few clothes, but that is enough to live with mom and dad with happiness. I believe you will understand these things one day.
          <br><br>


Perhaps, there are a lot of extreme weather you will experience these years, like extraordinarily hot or cold. You may also experience an expected drought or flooding. You may witness many wildfires, volcanoes, and storms. Again, I feel so ashamed about these, because my generation did not fight for climate crisis successfully. Thus, you guys should continue fighting to stop the climate change. There is something you have to remember and try you best to comply with. Do not waste food, eat less meat or be a vegetarian, have no more than one child with your husband or wife, always take public transportation on your way to school or work, travel less, buy less clothes, buy less unnecessary stuff, vote for a responsible candidate who are really caring about the environment when you have the right of vote, tell your friends and classmates the importance of protecting our environment, and join in some movements with some activists to save our planet together.

          <br><br>

Even though it is even more difficult for your generation to change the current situation, it is never too late to take an action if more people get involved. I believe you will grow up with a happy, positive and healthy life. I believe humans will live on earth for another several millennia.


Love,          <br><br>

Dear Me,

          <br><br>

Hi, this is the future me writing from the year 2060 and I am writing this letter to reflect the nature of climate crisis and what we have done to successfully mitigate it. During the 40 years after 2020, human beings restrained the increase of temperature according to Paris Agreement, below 2 degrees Celsius. Moreover, many countries including developed ones and developing ones beside U.S. have adopted similar policies like the Green New Deal, including European countries, China, Russia and so on. I am so glad that what you have learned from English 23 during your college years, the positive future scenario of our planet, has come true. 

          <br><br>

Firstly, I would like to describe what our lifestyles look like now in 2060. I live in a co-apartment community with my family and several of my friends’ families now in Hangzhou, China. This type of apartment combines the advantages of micro-apartment and co-housing community, and each of us has our own micro-apartment sizing about 220 square feet, while we have a shared micro-apartment for cooking and laundry. Our apartment building is equipped with solar panel, which provides us sufficient electricity. The bicycle road is reconstructed, with greenbelts between it and the motorway as well as stronger safety regulation. For each supermarket, there’s a special place where the supermarket put the discarded food and people can take them with the freegan spirit. I and my family enjoy more various and diverse plant-based culinary dishes because more restaurants serve foods that are environmentally-friendly. The subway infrastructure has finished its construction and become convenient for us to commute. Furthermore, the public transportation system includes adoption of electric bicycles and we oftentimes use them beside taking the subway.
          <br><br>


Also, I would present numerous policy changes and how them affect our life as well as our planet. The Green Policy in Hangzhou sets certain carbon fee for most industries according to their carbon emissions. The city government has a special office who is in charge of supervising companies in regulation of emissions and implementation of the policy. Companies that promote environmental protection would get subsidy from the government, which generates a virtuous cycle for the prosperity of environmentally-friendly industries. In my daily life for example, I often receive takeout food delivered by couriers who drive electric bicycle because they get extra rewards if they use public transportation. Another significant instances about cultural and regulatory change is that fashion industries are required to promote fair production line and publicly disclose their wage level for workers. Second-hand stores become more popular and mature, including clothes, household appliances, and electronic equipments. Besides CSR reports, companies are asked to disclose their carbon emission statistics to the public every year so that they try to reduce the emission not only for the sake of their reputation, but also for the planet. The Green New Policy also offers more job opportunities because of the implementation of wind power stations, solar power capacities, and eco friendly trains. 

          <br><br>

Internationally speaking, there are even huger changes. There are official and influential  environmental organizations between countries which work like the United Nations and regulate policy with stronger supervision. Under the effort of many countries, human return 60% of farmlands in 2020 to forests now, saving the biodiversity and plant diversity to some extent. America, Europe, and other First World countries share their technology and resources with developing countries such as India. These actions prevent further countries from exploiting natural resources for development. Instead, they get funds and human capitals from developed countries, and successfully switch their energy sources from fossil fuels to solar energy, wind energy, and hydroelectric generation. Fortunately, children of our generation in 2060 are cultivated in the culture of freeganism, minimalism, anti-consumerism, and anti-capitalism so that they enjoy largely plant-based diet, co-housing, and public transportation system since they were born. We are glad that children start from our generation have embrace a new and environmentally-friendly cultural ideology. 

          <br><br>

Through reflection, I appreciate every person in every generation who contributes to this issue by personal action, collective activism, or political action. For myself, I am grateful that Ken’s undergraduate course prepared me useful knowledge and provided me various meaningful ways to act upon the knowledge. I would remember this 40 years that human beings make a huge step toward saving the planet. More importantly, I encourage you to take actions right away, which could make our progress more quickly and influence more people.





Best,

          <br><br>

Future me.

Specifically, John from the past. This is John from the future and I hope this message reaches you well.
          <br><br>
In my freshman year of college, winter quarter, I took this class called English 23, or Climate Crisis 101. The class changed the way I thought about everything from that point on. I stopped shopping at Forever 21, H&M, and other stores that practiced fast fashion and the unethical consequences that came from such labor. The documentaries we watched in that class shaped a lot of the way I see things as well.
          <br><br>
The same quarter I took the class was the same quarter that the primaries were taking place, in which I voted for Bernie Sanders in hopes of furthering the Green New Deal, another thing that we learned in class that was going to be a big step for people. You already know now, but we were far past the point of simple minute solutions like changing light bulbs or saving water. The climate crisis was an urgent problem. As much as I wanna say how things got better, and it did, I’m going to have to explain and lead you through the parts where things got worse first.

          <br><br>


We really tried, but the Green New Deal failed to pass. Companies were too powerful and fracking continued to dominate. It was a huge stab in the heart in November 2020. I could already feel the earth crying, too. And earlier that year, COVID-19 took a huge toll on public action and gathering in general. Schools stopped and went online and a lot of people quit work. In the stores, people were going crazy loading up supplies. It was really scary. The saddest part was that I had to move out and leave UCSB for that spring quarter, saying goodbye to my friends who I wouldn’t see until September.
          <br><br>
I mention the corona virus because it was sort of like a wakeup call, a disaster just like climate change. Except, people reacted to corona quickly and eventually it subsided, but at the time I thought, climate change is a really big disaster too. People are going to die. If people are celebrating the end of corona, they shouldn’t be too happy because climate change brings a whole new wave of suffering as well. And in 2021, the world started to feel that suffering as practically every few weeks there was some sort of new report about a wildfire that went out of hand, or deadly hurricanes far surpassing Katrina. With the new decade that came in with 2020, it was as if those two years came in with a vengeance.

          <br><br>


And then we woke up collectively. Climate skepticism became illegal in a Supreme Court case called Washington V Heartland Institute, in which a teacher Mr. Washington thought how unconstitutional it was for the Heartland Int. to be spreading lies to classrooms, affecting children’s perception of the problem and hurting their future. The Heartland Int. demanded their freedom of speech, but when the earth was on fire, the Supreme Court came handy and shut them down. It was a victory but we still had a bit to go.
          <br><br>
The low income class were afraid of how the Green New Deal would affect their jobs, but thankfully, groups and activists came together to protect their future and made sure their presence was felt where there was change. I did my part in that too, having come from a low income family and as a first generation college student. Public transportation got better by 2026, and slowly we were trickling into a green world. But we had to stop being slow and thus the Green New Deal was passed and our world finally began to see major reforms starting in 2030.

          <br><br>


That was 30 years ago. Picking up after ourselves and coming together at last after a long fight and succeeding truly defined this century for me. And in writing this to you, I urge you, things will get better and you’re not just one person. Soon everyone will realize and when change comes, you sure as hell do your part in protecting the earth and low income families.

2016 may have been the year that I hesitantly chose my career path, but during 2020, after I took Ken Hiltner's "Climate Crisis 101," or English23 as I knew it, during my first year at UCSB, I knew exactly what my path would be. I was an activist before I took it, but it really brought out that side of me, and made me realize that we could tackle the climate crisis, which we did shortly after. Later that same year, even after the election, many people were skeptical of what kind of real change we could really implement, because the senate lacked the democratic majority many were hoping for in order to pass tons of legislation. But, fortunately for humanity, in 2024, after the 8th category 6 hurricane in 4 years, the country finally decided to take action. Regardless of political affiliation, people made climate change their top issue,  electing politicians from both sides of the aisle committed to enacting real change and preventing the dystopian future scientists had predicted since 1980.
           <br><br>

That year holds special significance for me, as it was my second year of law school, and the year I began teaching undergraduate students, and I had a COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT while doing so. In them, I found the same passion for the environment, which gave me a great amount of hope for the future, which I previously did not have. Elsewhere in the world, the EU enacted comprehensive energy policy, becoming the first major economy to do so, which really eliminated the claims that Trump made in 2018, about the Paris Climate Accords.Because of the EU's policy other nations began to quickly follow including China and the US.
           <br><br>

After finishing law school in 2026, I joined an environmental law firm, and finally achieved my goal from so long ago and started actively fighting the efforts of fossil fuel companies to pollute the planet. While I did not make a lot of money, and still have not, but I made a difference, which is all I can ask for. I pursued that same career path for the next twenty two years, after which I ran for Congress for the first, and last time. I lost in the primary, but found a candidate whom I believed in to enact the necessary sweeping reforms, as the United States still was lagging behind in terms of emissions. I found myself working for their presidential run in the following election, and won. I worked in the west wing for her, and we finally passed legislation resembling the green new deal, as my generation, the one that infused me with hope in my graduate teaching days, was now the generation in power.
           <br><br>

We dropped our emissions, finally, and became the last of the G7 from 2020 to do so. I stayed in politics until this day, and have found myself running her reelection campaign in 2056, which we won in a landslide, and for the Democratic nominee in 20160 as well. Millions of people had to suffer in order for the United States to ultimately realize the peril of the climate crisis, and, in ture United States fashion, our politicians failed to be at the forefront of changing the world, and only began to make progress after other nations did it first. The world population dropped by more than a billion in the last 40 years, and the planet is doing all the better for it.

Dear Younger Self of 2020,

           <br><br>

It’s me from the future and I hope that this letter will provide you with some much needed hope and inspiration. The year is 2060 and I have quite the story to tell regarding the climate crisis and how we as a global community, a nation, and us individually have done to address it. I know you may be feeling overwhelmed after taking English 23 and learning about the climate crisis from Ken but I am here to reassure you that change is coming and action will be taken as I will lay out the events of the past forty years.
           <br><br>


Up until the time at which you are reading this you have known and understood the urgent problem of climate change but after taking your English 23 class you have begun to take more personal actions within the coming year. You will switch over to a full climatarian diet and reject eating red meat outright in addition to changing your transportation decisions as you begin to drive less, prioritize walking, biking and utilizing public transportation. As for your political actions, the year of 2020 was the beginning to a long path of political action and engagement as you voted for the first time and was able to see your candidate win the presidency. Your decision to vote along with the many other million Americans thus started a movement to push for the systemic, structural change in America that had been needed for so many years.

           <br><br>

January, 2021. It was this year that Bernie Sanders assumed his role as President of the United States and the Democratic party maintained control in the house of representatives and gained back control of the Senate. It was this year that legislation finally began to get pushed out of Washington D.C. that worked for the people of this country and in favor of the climate. As promised, within the first 100 days in office Bernie was able to push for the Green New Deal and with slight modifications it passed in both houses of Congress. This success set the foundation to taking climate action and despite previously polarized political parties, both Democrats and Republicans were able to agree on issues surrounding climate change and pass countless bills and pieces of legislation.
           <br><br>


Fast forward to the year of 2030 and a lot of progress has been made. Building off of the ability of Bernie Sanders and the liberal congress to pass climate legislation with support of some conservatives as well, the list of successes and accomplishments in the years between 2021 and 2030 was astounding. The Green New Deal and the following legislation plunged huge sums of federal money to be invested into renewable resources such as wind, solar, and even nuclear energy. Nuclear energy was used successfully for five years to help transition off of fossil fuels and transition to more pure forms of renewable energy as it was also a form of transitioning that was supported across the aisle by Republicans as well as Democrats. By 2030 most Nuclear power plants became decommissioned and the transition to energy that was based more on solar and wind became a close reality. In addition to these successes, a permanent ban was placed on offshore drilling and fracking and the government subsidies that had been helping the fossil fuel industry for so many years finally ceased to exist. The other major success of climate legislation during this 9 year period was the passing of a carbon emission tax and dividend system that you yourself learned about during your English 23 class. Although it was not exactly the same it still resembles the fundamental points of taxing carbon emissions and they paying the dividends back into the hands of the American people to ensure that they did not disproportionately bear the burden of the tax.

           <br><br>

By the year 2045 even more changes had been made and this time they addressed some of the main points of corruption that you currently feel frustrated about in 2020. In 2032 a ban was placed on corporate lobbying and the landscape of donating to political campaigns completely shifted. Instead of lobbying and asking for money from corporate elites, the ban put in place a structured system in which a modest, yet progressive tax that excluded anyone below the salary of $40,000 per year and increased in scale to the point where the wealthy could compensate for those who were under the minimum income level. This tax then gets divided by every eligible American citizen who can vote who then can fill out a simple form and have their portion sent to the political candidate of their choice. So in summary, no more corporate lobbying or big fundraisers but instead a system that values everyone’s political contribution equally. The second big piece of legislation that came in 2038 and was fulfilled by 2044 was doubling down on solar installation on housing and buildings across America. The legislation entailed and mandated that all future housing projects in the United States that were built after the year 2038 be built with solar panels that had the capability of accounting for at least 60% of the house’s energy use. By 2044 the impact was significant as compounded with the successes from the past 25 years the global temperature rising rate was at an all time low and climate caused disasters were also at an all time low since before the 2000s.

           <br><br>

Finally by the time I am writing this message in the year 2060, a few more important climate change milestones have been reached and solutions have been deemed successful. One last specific accomplishment was a global success and one that involves other countries as the countries who were majorly responsible for the climate crisis (European countries, the U.S. and even Russia) took responsibility for their actions and through the DCFGE (Developing Countries For Green Energy) agreement. The DCFGE, through a long and complicated set of binding agreements ensured that developed countries which were determined by a consensus among other world leaders are in the future responsible for providing developing countries with the resources to build their economies using green energy similar to the way that the United States and Germany were able to help India develop into a prime example of a green economy after it seemed like they were destined to have an economy that would increase greenhouse emissions by a large margin.
           <br><br>


I hope you find this long, detailed, and promising message inspiring and hopeful as I would like to remind you to keep your faith in society and continue to strive to live a sustainable life that continues to encompass the environment and those around you. I know it has been a tough four years in terms of politics and climate inaction but you only have a few more treacherous months left of President Trump and you will soon see what America is really capable of when we come together to fight for change. Good luck in the coming years.

 To Whom it May Concern,
           <br><br>

 I have spent years reminiscing on things that could have been done differently by our dear society. If solely, I would have done more. If our country for once set aside our differences and focused on the bigger picture at hand. For years, I believed the tragic events reported on the news would change their ways and focus more on the positive aspects and address the larger issue at hand which is this climate crisis we are still trying to combat. Reporting on massive wildfires, major flooding, larger earthquakes, hurricanes, all warning signs in 2020 have gotten worse over the years. 
           <br><br>

 We are so in over our heads that nothing could get passed within the whitehouse because of this controversy plan of the Green New Deal. The term we referred to those who got us into this mess,”boomers” still want to shape the public opinions of focusing on other issues rather than our climate crisis. We live in a world where younger generations are picking up after us, trying to fix the mistakes older generations before us left behind. Although we’ve hit bumps in the road, that has not stopped us from building an army of climate activists. We are continuing to experience harsh climate change , with dryer summers, colder winters, everything we do still seems like we aren’t doing enough, it seems like we haven’t made progress because of the consequences we are facing. I don’t want to seem pessimistic about this whole situation, but the slow progress continues to frustrate me. No matter how much our generation Z in the year 2020 tried to voice our concern, I felt that we still weren’t heard enough. That we weren’t taken seriously and now look at the result we are faced with. We rather focus on the aftermath than acknowledge its existence and the whole reason climate issue was first started. 
           <br><br>

 Something we easily could’ve prevented, had we taken the necessary precautionary measures. Had our voices been heard when we still had time, now it just feels too late. It always felt that within the government, that our issue on climate change was not their first priority. Our sweet earth given to us to nurture and take care of now decaying right before us, still holding on to life for us because there’s hope and progress still to be made. Years and years of polluting our planet would not go away in just a matter of days, weeks or months. It’s something this generation is still trying to undo, had we had more people involved in getting involved we wouldn’t be picking up such a huge mess left behind.
           <br><br>

 Had we educated those of this issue sooner rather than later, had we taken up the actions presented to us in our earliest years when we were able to do so, had we mitigated change earlier, and acknowledged the existence of climate change. Had I set aside my embarrassment to my friends and family and said that I am a climatarian, I prefer to eat differently and calmly explain my reasoning to live a certain lifestyle rather than feel ashamed and criticized by them, only to later become upset with them questioning me. Had I approached things differently and communicated my understanding of the climate crisis to them and its importance, they would also be getting involved so that they could reduce their carbon footprint. 
           <br><br>

 However, I could only hope for the best for now and pray that the generation after me doesn’t experience such negative impacts of this climate crisis. A warning for all of us to act now sooner than later. It is only a matter of time before our earth is doomed to collapse.

A letter for myself in 2060:           <br><br>

Hi! I want to write a letter for the future you. In today, 2020, I am a simple international student who study in the UCSB. Santa Barbara is a beautiful and quiet small county. Compared to my hometown of China, here is cleaner air, more green vegetation, better ecology, less pollution, fewer cars. I walk or go to school by bus every day, and there is no such situation in China that too many people cannot get on the bus. The sky here is always blue and transparent. Sometimes there are smog in winter in China, it is best to wear a mask when going out. Even if I live in such a comfortable environment, our home planet still faces serious environmental problems. Santa Barbara has experienced forest fires many times, and the smoke is billowing. There have also been serious offshore oil spills here.
           <br><br>
I took a lesson this quarter-Engl23. The main content of this course is climate crisis. The professor told students many knowledges about the current situation of our planet. The ice of Glaciers in the Antarctic and Arctic are gradually melting, the average global temperature is increasing every year, soil erosion is getting worse, and acidification of seawater is becoming more and more common. However, there are more and more cars and more and more people flying by air. The exhaust emissions of these vehicles have a great impact on the environment. Also, he gave us many suggestions of how to protect the environment through doing some small things in your daily life. For example, eat less meat, especially beef, live in a smaller house, and replace 5 plane trips per year by train or big trips every 2 years.
           <br><br>
I am grateful for this class. If there are many such teachers around me to educate and encourage more people to protect the environment, I think our planet will become better and better. I believe that in 2060 I will also live in an American environment with clear seasons and fresh air.

To my past self:
           <br><br>


It is now the year 2060, Im 59 years old and boy has life been a journey. While I reminisce over my college days I remember taking this course on the climate change, while I viewed to be extremely liberal at the time of it first starting I quickly started to understand what type of climate crisis we were actually in at the time and how much as a society we needed to change and we did just that.

           <br><br>

2020 was the first year i ever voted and we managed to elect the underdog Bernie Sanders as president, finally a president who would put emphasis on climate change and overcoming our climate crisis. The long awaited green new deal passed and things quickly began turning up. Corporations began cutting production greatly as they tried to come up with ways of utilizing sustainable energy to keep high production numbers. While the air may have been becoming cleaner tensions were high as our economy truly suffered in this transition period as the green new deal was enstated, workforces changed job titles, corporations lowered productions, republicans were angry but soon enough sustainable energy kept on growing and corporations finally were able to transition and the economy began growing again in a way that wasn't having a detrimental effect on our environment, it was truly remarkable. Gasoline cars were quickly dying out as automotive companies worked to produce electric vehicles quickly as gas prices skyrocketed to serve as an incentive to make the transfer. Luckily a program was enstated that consumers could trade in their current gas powered vehicles to be recycled for parts that would be used in electric vehicles giving them discounts on their new energy sustainable automobiles. Electric cars flooded the interstates and bicycles flooded the newly crafted safe bike lanes with automotive barriers (a technique we learned from Denmark!). The world was working together as one as we promoted economic growth all while doing so in an environmentally conscious manner. 
           <br><br>
The negative effects we were having from our excessive pollution back in the 10’s and 20’s plateaued off and our environment has stayed consistent. Temperatures may have slightly lessened but most importantly it hasn’t grown at all. Minimalism caught on as a trend as well so me and your now wife live in a small complex with the bare amenities but lots of community shared features such as parks and gardens (typical old people stuff i know). But regardless we’re happy. Happy we aren’t surrounded by wildfires and random natural disasters and we were able to raise children in a safe atmosphere. Life is good the air is clean and the grass is green. The world is a much safer and less toxic place. No more need for avid protesting and the struggling of a country together helped to keep peace within ourselves and lower levels of unnecessary hate and discrimination at all. Tech is advancing and the world is happy, hopefully soon we’ll have flying hoverboards as well.

           <br><br>

Oh also that genius guy Elon Musk, yea he did some crazy cool stuff you may not believe. Those ideas of electric boats and commercial airplanes worked out. He managed to build an electric motor powerful enough and efficient enough to power a whole plane and all the people on it so no more 2tons of carbon emissions per plane ride. You can now travel the world to every country you’d like guilt free. Technology was a huge part of transitioning our community to a green economy but it all started with that struggle of activism in the beginning. Keep fighting for what you believe in and the future's looking bright kiddo.

Too much has happened in the past 40 years. I think I can first express my gratitude to Ken for teaching English 23 lessons. That year-2020-that was my third year in college, and a lot changed. Wildfires in California, Australia, Amazon, Amazon, and the coivd 19 pandemic, canceled locally and around the world, were cancelled for the rest of the year, and the 2020 presidential elections were all busy for a year. Before class, I already knew that the world was experiencing the effects of climate change. We can easily find all the hurricanes, the wildfires mentioned above, rising sea levels, endangered or extinct species, rising global temperatures, and the death of coral reefs. But it wasn't until the end of the class that I started to feel a sense of urgency. I realize that unless our generation makes a difference, our children and grandchildren will have no future. I realize that unless our generation makes a difference, our children and grandchildren will have no future. I also realized that I don't really understand the meaning of true happiness, and happiness can be achieved simply.
           <br><br>
I was still too naive. I used to think that human desires would destroy human beings, and human reason and education could not overcome desires. But we did it. We worked hard to develop new technologies to make the earth ’s ecological environment more suitable for survival. Although to a large extent, we have done our best to change the status quo, but there are still many defects in this crisis. Although the generation on the ground was unaware of the consequences of their actions, they have had a huge impact. Sorry, we cannot reverse these unfortunate consequences, but I hope we can minimize this situation. Sorry, there may be many beautiful places in the world submerged, or there are so many natural disasters that no one can feel safe no matter where they are. I hope not, but I won't be surprised if one day. I assure you, we did indeed turn things around for you. We will continue to work hard. Please don't give up.

Today I am writing from a time that most people didn’t see coming when I was in college in 2020. The year is 2060, and I have much to report about the progression of the climate crisis. While some of this news is good, there also has been much to be concerned about over the last forty years.
            <br><br>
2020 was the year in which I was first able to vote in a presidential election. The top candidates were Trump on the republican side and Sanders for the democrats. Being a someone concerned about the climate crisis and the feeling of impending doom for our planet, you can guess which way I was leaning. This, thankfully for the sake of the United State’s environmental contribution, went the way I was hoping. Trump was finally out of office, and Sanders began his administration with a serious focus on bettering the climate crisis. 
           <br><br>
He nudged our way back into the Paris Agreement, first and foremost, which was an important step for our country. In rejoining, as a nation, focus and funds were shifted toward renewable energy and bettering all possible systems in terms of environmental impact and carbon emissions. We actually made some pretty great advancements over the years. Of course not immediately but over time, the American people completely transitioned to electric transportation when unable to walk/bike, and the best part of this was the development of the technology creating these machines. When I was in college, the production of electric vehicles, while creating better ways of transportation, emitted an astonishing amount of carbon, which made the whole idea somewhat contradictory. In around 2030, however, a new way of creating electric vehicles was introduced and the process transitioned over to a much less harmful production method. Similarly, new technology was created that decreased the pricing of solar panels (which had also been made much smaller to accommodate smaller spaces), and allowed our nation and many others to go mostly all solar. This was huge for the planet, and I’m so pleased that it was accomplished. 
           <br><br>
The most relevant of the bad news to myself, however, was the rise of sea level and extinction of many species as we continued to advance in this developing world. As technological advancement did have many planetary benefits, it also took a toll in other aspects. The continuation of taking over new habitats in terms of building and developing displaced and wrecked many ecosystems and contributed badly to the environment. Even with our advancements that did aid in the reduction of carbon emissions, sea temperature continued to rise as well as the increased melting of the ice caps because what we had accomplished did not cut down world emissions enough. Because of this, many aquatic species went extinct. Ecosystems were wrecked (coral extinction specifically meant the loss of habitat and ecosystem to an immense population), we lost a large source of food in the world, and the largest part of our planet has been put in jeopardy. The rising sea levels displaced many coastal communities and many people lost their homes, jobs, and well-being. 
           <br><br>
Either way, I do feel that we as a community and nation have made the climate crisis much more of a focus than it was 40 years ago, and for that I am grateful. I do hope we and future generations continue these efforts so as not to continue in the destruction of the planet we live on.

The year is 2060 

           <br><br>

The climate crisis has been a prevalent theme in my lifetime and the few decades predating me. Especially in the late 2010s and 2020s, I have turned my attention towards environmentalism and climate activism, all in the hope of helping to prevent future damage to our planet. My only hope is that my experiences will yield others as a warning to those who believe ignoring a problem and sticking to the status quo will work in your favor. 
           <br><br>
I feel like I can’t explain the timeline of the climate crisis without discussing it’s history. To truly understand, you must know that we as humans have a responsibility to care for this earth; we single handedly ruined this earth, and have slowly moved to patch it back together. First and foremost, climate change was nowhere near a new topic in the 2000s. Anthropogenic emissions have long been suspected to be detrimental to our atmosphere since the nineteenth century. But primitive research was dismissed and buried as our world industrialized. The birth of various industries, from cars to plastic to phones, has largely contributed to the pollution of our world, and a large reason for this is the materialism and capitalism behind ideals like the American Dream. Sure, this dream proved heavily productive for attracting laboring immigrants and boosting the US’s economy, but this arrogance of boosting our country’s GDP greatly harmed our planet. The more our world ‘modernized’, the farther we drifted from awareness. It took decades before enough people turned their heads and realized that we had drifted past the point of return. 
           <br><br>
After the wake of the coronavirus, the global population decreased by two percent. This global event woke people up, I think, climate change was no longer a dream. All across the world, various activists, scientists, and individuals who had risen up to demand sustainability finally received enough attention to warrant mass change. Personally, I pursued environmental activism, choosing veganism, cohousing, and reusable minimalism. Like a lot of my generation, I turned away from the trappings of materialism and found myself fulfilled working a career that helped deal with the consequences of this crisis. These decades were so unique because so many of us were using our resources, like social media, to strengthen the movement; we made it trendy to be environmentally conscious. 
           <br><br>
Once we stopped thinking about ourselves and started looking at the bigger picture, that’s when our work got started. One of the first steps was to go down the list of twenty things we could do to combat climate change and start checking stuff off. What this did is gave people a direction, a goal to accomplish. The Green New Deal proved to be a success, creating more jobs and strengthening every aspect of our society. 
           <br><br>
I think the biggest theme of the climate crisis has been that it’s all connected; every little thing we do has a hold in the health of our planet. From teenage trends to capitalistic gain, every action we choose to make contributes to the climate crisis, and finally the world realized they could no longer look away. American dream fizzled out as our country failed its citizens again and again. The impacts of this shook the world, proving arrogance was not substantial.
           <br><br>
Our generation grew the movement into a global phenomenon, strengthened it with science and sociology. But the work is never done; our detrimental actions have proven to be irreversible. All we can do is continue to pass on this sense of urgency, teaching our kids to care for the beauty of nature and the health of our planet. The last words of my generation’s breath are “act now, act now. Act Now.”
           <br><br>
And now, knowing all that I know, what will you do?

Dear Future Family
           <br><br>

When we will be reading this the year should be 2060, living in San Francisco in our modest studio apartment. My bike has now lasted me 20 years and the end doesn't seem near for it. We have just celebrated my 59th birthday and it was the best one yet. The city smell of no pollution, for we have switched to all renewable energy, and the roads filled primarily with bikes. My favorite meal will be sitting on the table, with little carbon emissions attached to it. You are all home from your jobs, and we bring up my children's days when they were in college. They remind me of their Climate Crisis History class, and it brings me back to 2020, when I took my climate crisis class, when the issue was coming to a forefront. The rest of this letter will detail how we beat this crisis and gotten to this moment in itself.
           <br><br>

In 2020, change was only beginning. Unfortunately we were unable to vote out Trump from office due to division in the Democratic party, but in 2024 we elected Teressa Gilmore (Fictional for name purpose), and that is when we got the ball rolling. With a same party house senate and president, the Green New Deal was enacted and our lives changed forever. By 2030 all of these changes were put into effect, and the world carbon emissions were slashed. The most impactful improvements that were made were the transition to public transportation and renewable energies entirely. By 2032, the United Nation announced that the world was on pace to wipe out this Crisis that we thought was inevitable just 8 years prior. The year 2038 was major, that was the time when the world was saved from this issue and the overall happiness of the world rose by 20 percent. Air travel was almost obsolete after we developed high speed rails to go over the Ocean. And by 2040, the majority of the world stopped eating meat.
           <br><br>

You were just children in the 40's and young adults in the 50's so you all reaped the major benefits of the progress my generation made. I now an executive at WindTurbo, the worlds largest provide of wind energy have worked so hard and now I see the rewards. In 2020 I was doubtful, and it wasn't until about 2029 I went Climatarian, and it was one of the best choices I made for my life. By 2026, I rid myself of my car and switched to the first electric bike I ever owned. My productivity shot up, and my life progress more in those 10 years than any other in my life. You guys take all this for granted, but for me, this all makes me proud of the progress we were able to make on earth. I hope that this letter is read just as I wrote in 40 years ago and the world is saved.

To whom it may concern, 
           <br><br>

This is a message from the future. It has been a long, tireless journey to make it where we are today. It all began back in 2020. 2020 was a year plagued by numerous worldwide natural disasters, the outbreak of CoronaVirus, economic uncertainty, and social inequality. 2020 was also the year that others and myself began to take collective action to combat the climate crisis. 
           <br><br>

In 2020, I decided to change my lifestyle to be more sustainable. Before 2020, I viewed myself as an environmentalist and volunteered with various environmental nonprofits and was vegan, however, I was still emitting far more than 2 metric tons of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere each year. In 2020, I learned that the majority of my climate footprint came from air travel and I decided to only fly once every five years. Instead of flying, I began to go on road trips and explore the geographical diversity that California offers. During these road trips, I was not focused on the destination but more so the journey and I began to appreciate slow travel. In 2020 I also learned that even though I was vegan, my food choices still had negative environmental impacts. I decided to shop more frequently at local farmer's markets and purchase foods that are in season, organic, and grown locally and do not have to be shipped from far away places. I was not the only one to change their lifestyle, people all over the world were gradually becoming more aware of the severity of the climate crisis and realized that the time to act is now.
           <br><br>

During the 2020 elections, Bernie Sanders was elected president of the United States, however, Republicans still held the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives. Bernie Sanders repealed many of Trump’s policies and signed the United States back into the Paris Agreement and reversed Trump’s environmental rollbacks. Bernie attempted to implement the Green New Deal, however, it was not well received by the Republican majority, who feared it would significantly raise taxes. Bernie was able to make college significantly less expensive and make healthcare accessible to many more people. Furthermore, Bernie passed legislation on campaign reform and made voting easier and more accessible. Then in 2022, because of Bernie’s work on campaign reform, the voter turnout was the highest it has ever been, with young people and minorities showing up to the polling places in large numbers. In 2022, the Democrats took control of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Green New Deal was finally signed into law. 
           <br><br>

The Green New Deal took twelve years to fully implement. Under the Green New Deal, the United States overhauled the transportation system and made mass transit more affordable and accessible and, stopped burning fossil fuels and transitioned to renewable energy, and transformed the American economy. During this transition, the United States government ensured that people had access to guaranteed jobs, public employment, universal health care, education, and training. The success of the Green New Deal led to more legislation that focused on social injustices and environmental sustainability.
           <br><br>

In 2032, the United States became a model country for social justice and environmental sustainability. The United States began to allocate funds and other resources to help the developed countries that disproportionately bear the burden of the ramifications attributable to climate change. The United States helped these developing countries through knowledge and technology exchange, investments in renewable infrastructure, and loans and funding.
           <br><br>

In 2038, the US passed a law that mandated teachers to discuss the climate crisis and use a universal, comprehensive lesson created by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Teachers were required to teach about the severity and urgency of the climate crisis and about possible actions that one can take in their daily life to reduce their climate footprint. During this time, influencers began to go vegan and practice minimalism and mindfulness. Taken together, teachers and influencers successfully initiated sweeping cultural change in the US. The American dream changed and people began to define success as being happy, having meaningful relationships, having a purpose, and more!
           <br><br>

Now, we are in 2060 and I am writing this letter in a community housing collective in La Joya. Every day, I bike four miles each way to my work. I work 30 hours a week (the new standard work week) at a local hospital as a family practice doctor. I love and find an immense amount of meaning through my work. Tomorrow, I am in charge of cooking for our house, which I have the opportunity to do twice a month. Today, I am going to walk to the local market to get some locally grown vegetables for our vegan dinner tomorrow. 
           <br><br>

I now ask future generations to continue on our path of sustainability. Though my generation has taken actions to achieve a more sustainable and socially just society, there is still more work to be done. It is now in your hands to make the world a better place for all of its inhabitants. I will leave you with this quote by AOC “We can be whatever we have the courage to see.”

<p>
I just want to tell you how happy I am for you to finally be independent and learn to be your own man. I know you are very tired of us watching your every move. You picked the perfect University. I remember getting there summer of 2019, now it’s 2060, and it’s your turn to learn to be an actual human being. I’m 60 now, but the memories and important lessons I learned during my college years are still clear in my head. I came in as an unconcerned freshman that only cared about getting my degree, so I could make money, and have fun. In my time there, I definitely learned and matured at a really fast pace even as a freshman. I was already noticing the abundance lifestyle that I saw around me but as I went through my day I noticed that a lot of our actions are driven by institutionalized consumerism and that is a direct effect of the dominant economic system during my time: capitalism. I was part of that problem, and it was a little bit late before I realized that people were destroying the world we were living in everyday in ways that we didn’t even realize. I also noticed that a lot of students that were in school had their priorities on temporal happiness, not permanent. In UCSB, you are going to have to make a lot of choices. And I trust you that whatever choice you make you need to observe and know that everything’s not fixed. You learn from your mistakes, from other’s mistakes, as well as the right choices you do. Just remember that it is important to care about other people, cause you are not just protecting others you are also protecting yourself and your future. 
           <br><br>
Also, don’t forget to vote. During my freshman year UCSB’s normal sessions during spring were stopped because COV-19, a new virus that devastated few countries before hitting us. Those countries were devastated because the virus was new and the way it spread was rapidly fast a lot of people got infected before it got contained. The figures leading your country directly affect your life even though their effect may seem nonexistent. Your voice matters. Our government was watching from afar when the virus was devastating other countries, and with our technological advances and the wealth that our president bragged about we were supposed to have been able to contain the spread quickly. You can’t underestimate anything. Small things can create both negative and positive impacts. Even small things like what you eat affects you and everyone around you. A government that only focuses on making money and not the actual health of the country is going down the wrong path. Our government focused on wealth and we generated that through conspiring with powerful businesses that did not care about our environment and those had a lot of consequences you will probably see in your time.

A message from the future:
           <br><br>


To whomever this may concern -- the year is 2060, and so much has happened in the past 40 years. I guess I could start by expressing how grateful I am to have taken the English 23 class with Ken Hiltner. That year -- 2020 -- was when I was in my third year in college and so much change was taking place. The wildfires occurring both locally and globally in California, Australia, the Amazon, the Coronavirus pandemic that cancelled school the rest of the year, the 2020 presidential election all made for a hectic year. Before I had taken the class, I already knew that the world was experiencing the effects of climate change. It was easy to see with all the hurricanes, aforementioned wildfires, sea levels rising, species becoming endangered or extinct, global temperatures rising, coral reefs dying, and so much more. However, it was not until I took the class that I started to feel a sense of urgency. I realized that unless my generation did something, that there would be no future for our children and grandchildren. I also realized that I didn't really know the meaning of true happiness, or at least didn't understand that one could be happy without having all this "stuff" in our lives. So yeah, I am super thankful to Ken and his lecture. Fast forward to 2060, and I can proudly say that my generation was able to save the planet. At first, it did not seem like we would accomplish the massive task of reducing our carbon footprints and radically changing our way of life. People thought the Green New Deal would never achieve anything because it demanded too much change. There was no way people would give up their comfortable lifestyles to make a change int he world that wouldn't manifest until many years later -- this time delay was also the reason why we got to the climate crisis in the first place. However, my generation and the one after mine were able to get our voices heard, and place climate activists into positions of power. It all started when we were able to oust then President Donald Trump out of office and replace him with Bernie Sanders, who was much more inclined to fight the global climate catastrophe. The carbon tax was actually made feasible and passed, which greatly cut down  how much people drove. In addition, slow travel was made popular, and everyone was able to start learning how to build social capital, rather than economic capital. Today, bikes are the norm to travel around, everyone lives in smaller apartments (the green metropolis we learned about in Ken's lecture was actually realized, which I think is really cool), and many grow their own food. Modern technology has made all of this possible, as a lot of things are solar powered rather than powered by fossil fuels. All of these changes took time, and although there are still so many people who are reluctant to make lifestyle changes, we have done enough to at least stall the destruction of our planet.

Dear 2020, 
           <br><br>
It's now in 2060. I am so happy to tell you that I am still alive! I have to say life is way better today than in the past, clean air, clean water, and many other good stuffs. We have achieved the goal to make our environment back!
           <br><br>
In this paragraph, I must tell you that whatever in the last sentence are lies. We are still working on it, and I must let you know that the problem is getting worse. In these 40 years, we tried so many ways. We have changed our economic system from focusing on overload short-run factory growth to long-run human growth. Everything seemed great at the beginning, but, unfortunately, as the system started running, many countries cannot go to a reconciliation. The resources on this world is limited. Poor countries wanted to obtain more resources for their reign, while rich countries would never give up what they already had. It had been a hard time for this world at that time.
           <br><br>
Things did not change until 2034 when the Tokamak energy machine became fully completed and employed. This machine uses high temperature to burn hydrogen. When four hydrogen comes together with high temperature, a helium will be generated and release unimaginable clean energy. It had been innovated for thirty years before it had shown in front of us. The machines are efficient and can produce clean energy cheaply. The traditional gasoline market was hurt, many countries with high gasoline storage started a war, an actual war, to threaten those countries who employed this energy. This war had lasted for seven years. Fortunately, no one got killed directly by this war. However, it led to a huge rate of homeless and unemployed people. They died in hunger and hopelessness. 
           <br><br>
Finally, all countries went up with an agreement in 2041 because none of them can afford that kinds of loss in people and economy. They started to rebuild everything and called this project “Messiah.” In the year followed, I became a member of designer team of this project. The basic job we were doing at the beginning was separate the areas with numbers which represent the estimated years needed for repairing. This was a huge work. It took us three years to classify everything and two years to get the approve from the Union.
           <br><br>
In 2055, I was 55 years old. I had been staying in “Messiah” for thirteen years. A good news came in this year: I was elected as the chief designer, and my term was starting from the next year. Such a nice news but I cannot give a smile in return. Thirteen years! Almost one eighth of my lifetime! What we had done was just getting 15% of the areas back in normal. We lied to the public, for hope, that we had done 55%. By my observation, the Earth is coming to its sixth environmental apex. If we cannot get everything done in 10 years, everything is finished, including human civilization. 
           <br><br>
Maybe I should admit that the earth is not suitable for living anymore. I shall elect for the initiation of “Noah” project. “Noah” is a ship, a ship that can travel in the universe with 1% of the light speed. The plan sounds doable. With Tokamak, we can easily produce the energy we need to start this ship and ensure it can travel in the way we want it to be. 
           <br><br>
Tomorrow is the election day. Shall I elect for it? I do not know, but please, if you have chance to see this letter, prevent the war!!

To my future self,           <br><br>

I hope you remember the course you took your freshman year of college about the climate crisis, and how much it changed your outlook on the environment. The course only strengthened your views about taking the measures to combat climate crisis. One thing I hope you've done is reduce the amount of meat you eat. Coming from a family and culture where meat is a big part of your lifestyle,  know it's been hard to commit to a vegetarian diet, or even trying a vegan lifestyle but I can only hope that you've taken the steps to at least reduce the amount of meat you consume. It would be really cool if you tried tasing your kids as vegetarians at least, or giving them the option to explore that kind of diet. One thing I have started doing since starting this course, is trying to be more aware of eating meat during my meals throughout the day. What I've found is that it's actually not as hard to be aware of maybe choosing a vegetarian option at lunch. I think for a lot of people, there is a misconception that being vegetarian or vegan is super restrictive and you have to be super vigilant about what you consume, but taking those small measures showed me how easy it is too just cut down on how much meat you eat in a day. Thinking about the health benefits that also come with cutting meat out of your life is also motivating to commit to that kind of lifestyle. .
           <br><br>

Another thing I hope you've thought about is the amount of kids you have. Me, now in 2020, knows that I would love to have 4 kids. Coming from a really big family, and always having a lot of siblings and family members around I would love to replicate that and give my kids that big family. However, I know this want isn't conducive to the state of our world, and the fact that the world population is far greater than what can be sustained. That being said I can understand wanting a lot of kids, but I hope you have at least thought about the effect that would have, and maybe considered reducing 4 to 2. 
           <br><br>

Lastly, one thing your present self really does hope you completely eliminate from your life is shopping and supporting fast fashion. I don't know if you're gonna remember but your younger self was OBSESSED with online shopping and honestly going to the mall whenever she could. Yeah I knew about sweat shops and child labor that results from making these clothes and other things I indulge in, and yet I still continued to support them. Then I took this English 23 course that really did open my eyes to how bad people in countries that produce these garments are treated and exploited. The movie "True Cost"-you should rewatch, it's honestly a really good watch)- exposed the tragedy those who work in these factories face, from death to extremely low wages to poor working conditions face on the daily in order to provide for themselves and their families. For me, watching that movie made me step back and think about how I can make a small change in fast fashion, and that is by buying more second hand and doing my research on the companies that I want to buy from before I actually go shopping. So, I hope that you've become more conscience about the places you choose to shop from ethically moral places, and also participated in more thrift shopping.
           <br><br>

This is a letter from your 2020 self, hoping that as I've grown up I 've taken measures  to be more conscience about my actions and their effects on the climate.

<p>
It is 2060. How time flies! It has been forty years since I first attended university. I was still new to society and felt hopeful for the future and life. That year, I had a class related to the climate crisis, which I felt interested in since high school. The class was really informative and realistic that broadens my horizon to the planet and makes me to concern more about the globe. Since then, I took part in the activities to protect our climate and planet and encourage people surrounding me to make some personal changes to reduce their carbon emissions and vote. 
           <br><br>

I could not express how that course impacted me for my future actions. In that course, I knew what happened in the other end of the world before, what they suffered, as well as what the planet suffered, and issues related to the climate crisis. People lacked the awareness of climate change and solutions to mitigate the problem; governments dodged and did not take action; people in the poor countries suffer from what largely caused by developed countries; species lose their habitats and resources, and even worse, lose their lives. This anthropogenic issue made the world in disaster, but people were still reluctant to make any changes. I felt really sorry about these and while watching documentaries related to these issues, I resolved to start my personal actions and become an activist. Fortunately, 2020 was a significant year and it was also a transition period. After several dramatic disasters, like wildfire, floods, huge glacial recession, and human diseases, people began to realize how the world was changing due to climate change. Companied with the efforts of scientists and climate activists, most people acknowledged the existence of climate crisis and global warming. Governments began to attach great importance to the climate crisis and global warming; they saw how these issues brought dramatic catastrophes; they started to recreate a world where species and human beings harmoniously coexist, where industries do not pollute the environment for money, where the glaciers no longer melt and recover to their original magnificent appearance. Individuals were more and more encouraged and inspired to adapt their lifestyles that are more suitable for the Earth, like small housing or co-housing, small family size, less driving and flight, and more vegetables in the meals. During these forty years, I witness the change all around the world and am proud of these actions. Although the effects are slight, humans are still fighting and working on it. 
           <br><br>

As for me, I tried my best to eliminate the carbon footprint in my life. I became a minimalist and vegetarian. I really enjoy these kinds of lifestyles and they make my life full of happiness and convenience. I would not worry about too many staff and even calories to lose weight! With small number of objects, I feel freer and more stress-free. Another action I did is voting. I felt that it is really important of politicians who concern climate crisis a lot and who actually take part in actions and would support policies dealt with climate change. So, I vote for them and encourage my family and friends to vote. I also worked in communities to encourage others to take part in these activities and spread ideas of climate change. With these efforts, our governments begin to attach importance to these issues and our world is becoming better.
           <br><br>

I really appreciate what our governments did to mitigate climate change. If we were still reluctant to make any changes, I could not imagine how worse the planet will become now. I will keep playing a role in activities and there is still a long fight, but I believe that we can change the situation and get a better world.

A Message From the Future:

           <br><br>

Hello from the year 2060! Since you are reading this in the year 2020, I know you must still be incredibly pessimistic about what the future holds regarding the climate crisis. You have every right to be doubtful and to question the American government because it has yet to prove to you that it can do anything right. However, I am writing to tell you that it does get better. 

           <br><br>

After a very close election, President Bernie Sanders finally took office in 2020 and that is when everything started to look brighter. We passed the Green New Deal and instantly started making changes to fight the climate crisis.

           <br><br>

At first these changes were minor, such as less meat being sold in stores and cars and gas becoming less affordable. But these small changes started building up more and more. Instead of less meat being sold in stores, eating meat completely disappeared and most grocery stores started selling primarily plant based products. People stopped driving cars all together, and instead President Sanders implemented an entirely new transportation system that has virtually no carbon footprint while transporting millions of people and goods. He also made it much easier to bike throughout America, creating safe bike paths and encouraging biking throughout different cities and rural areas. I am extremely happy to say that the United States finally stopped exploiting under developed countries by completely shutting down the fast fashion industry in 2030 after millions of Americans protested and boycotted it entirely. This was clearly a huge accomplishment and I am proud to say that I was a big part in making this change.
           <br><br>


In the year 2038 you decided to run as a California Senator and began your campaign. You were elected in 2040, and continued your fight for both climate and social justice, from within the system. I am pleased to tell you that you enjoyed your time in office and were able to create a lot of much needed change. While we still do not live in a perfect utopia and there is still a lot that is yet to be accomplished in terms of justice and equality, we have come so far since you were a sophomore in college and we are on the path to continue this journey for a very long time.

<p>

Dear  new generation,            <br><br>

I truly hope that by the time I am reading this to you, my generation in some way stopped or slowed down the climate crisis. The year of 2018-2020 is around the time I actually started learning about the climate crisis and greenhouse gas emissions and how this would affect our planet. Then my freshman year of college I took two courses, back to back, with Professor Ken Hitlner who focused on informing his students about the climate crisis--and this is where I really learned in depth about the issues we were facing. 2019 is a year of many natural disasters like floods in Miami and Dubai also many fire breakouts, plus crazy weather. I remember, it was the day before I was leaving back home for Thanksgiving break, a fire broke out in the mountains behind my dorm, then the next morning, when waiting for the bus to go back home, there was ashes falling from the sky. I have lived through the climate crisis, when it was at its worst, and we do have the generation before mine to blame. However, I hope your generation sees us as the hero’s that saved you. 
           <br><br>
I am sitting in my dorm writing this paper, and I have finished reviewing all the material we covered in my climate crisis class. Professor Ken’s last lecture video gave a list of 20 top things we can do to fight this climate crisis. I am going to list them: 
eat a plant-based diet (vegan or freegan) and limit food waste
be conscious with your food choices (ex. it's harmful to eat asparagus in the winter) 
use contraception 
educate boys and girls fairly

The elections for our 2020 president just passed on March 3rd, and I made sure everyone I knew, who could vote, voted. I did so myself, and I voted for a president that I knew believed in the climate crisis and would pass the Green New Deal and the carbon tax. Based on what I learned, I feel like yes making a personal change in our daily lives is essential, but to actually make a difference or a big one at least is to get to the roots which is our political system. They have real power and it’s important to vote for the right candidates. I remember we even had a march for Bernie here at UCSB campus. I am happy that the students I go to school with are passionate about making a difference in our school. We are all informed about the issues that we have to face and I have high expectations for our generation. I know we will solve this issue. Our will is so strong. I have multiple conversations with my peers and we may disagree about certain things but when it comes to the climate crisis we are all in agreement. 
On top of fighting the climate crisis politically, the list includes so many personal changes that we can take in our daily lives to make a change. I personally have cut down on meat, which is actually really hard because of the mexican dishes back home. But I hope that by the time I am reading this, I have become vegetarian, because honestly I have been eating more salads and I feel so strong and my brain is functioning a lot better. Plus, I hope that my generation got streets here in the United States to be more bike friendly and harder for cars to transport and easier for public transportation. I know my generation, each is doing their own thing, and consuming less. Thrifting is a big trend right now in my generation, which is a good thing because we need to keep the items we have for longer and not give into fast fashion. Hopefully, we taught you guys to be the same and that your textbooks include information about the climate crisis, so that we don’t have to go back to that lifestyle. 
           <br><br>
In conclusion, I keep saying “I hope” but in fact I know my generation will not let you guys down. In fact if i am even reading this outloud to you guys, the newest generation, then that itself is a grand accomplishment. That means, we managed to save you guys. Our past generation failed us, and it’s only right for my generation to learn from their mistakes. Based on what I see on social media and the events going on at UCSB campus and other campuses, I know many people in my generation are more aware of the climate crisis and are willing to fight back. I am proud of my generation!

To my kids: 

           <br><br>

The year is 2060. As you know I'm your dad and getting close to good ole 59 years old.  I'm writing to you to reflect on my adulthood, pretty much my life. As you may have learned in your history classes a lot has happened in my lifetime.  Believe it or not my generation is responsible the world we live in today is the way it is. We were the ones to take the lead in demanding change for the planet. It all started for my my freshman year of college. I took a class called English 23 but it was far from an English class. It was better known as Climate Crisis 101. It was honestly an eye opener for me. Growing up i knew there were issues with the way people were treating the world and how irresponsible we were with our natural resources. I know that it was horrible but I really didn't grasp how severe the problem really was. I always saw tweets or Instagram posts (the social media back in the day) that scientists estimate we have less than 10 years in this planet before it becomes inhabitable. I didn't believe it but i learned quickly that those estimations weren't exactly far fetched. The population was out of control.  The world population was at 7 billion and estimated to be at 10  billion by 2050. I just want to shed some light on the fight that my generation was faced with in our youth.

           <br><br>

The main goal of the movement was sustainability. We needed to find ways to keep the planet healthy enough to support the amount of people in this planet. Everyone had a carbon footprint. Greenhouse gasses were our biggest enemy. We needed to find ways to keep our carbon footprint down because the greenhouse gasses keep heat within the planet which is why for many years it was called global warming. this was the case but the warming wasn't the main issue. We knew there would be storms, famine, unpredictable weather, regions of the planet that are literally uninhabitable because of the climate, flooding of islands, etc. These were all things ready to come our way if we didn't make a change. There was a proposal that my professor showed us called Project Draw-down. It was a list of things that we need to do in order to slow the effects of the climate crisis. There were some surprising thing on the list that shocked me like the proper disposal of refrigerators because of the chemicals inside of them have detrimental effects on the environment. Following this really did a lot for our planet and really  set up the world that you know and live in today. The norms of today were merely ideas when I was your age. 
           <br><br>


Due to our persistence in personal actions and voting for people who believed in the climate crisis my generation did a lot for the planet. There is still work to be done and i believe your generation has been raised to carry on our movement. I want this letter to be a passing of the torch. My generation did great things with what we had. I know what you are capable of doing and I have s good feeling it will be even greater. 


Love you,           <br><br>
 Dad

"Climate Crisis 101", taught by professor Ken Hiltner, began the decade of the 20's in a way that's hard to explain. I'm simultaneously terrified for what the future holds and incredibly inspired by the all the people working to make life sustainable. What am I doing? Definitely not enough. I'm vegan when it's convenient, sometimes I eat dairy and eggs, occasionally chicken if it's a bad day. Most of my diet is plant based though, I never eat red meat or fish. I ride my bike around campus but still drive my fuel inefficient car home for breaks. I live in a tiny dorm with two other people. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the democratic primary. I only buy the things I need, and thrift what I can. I try to create as minimal waste as possible, but it's so hard when everything is made of plastic. Above all I have a major desire to improve climate related scientific communication. I want to write a picture book describing climate change because I want people to see the issue the same way I do. There is absolutely no sense of urgency amongst the general population to fix our climate problems and I honestly don't know what needs to change. I go back and forth between inspiration and despair.. Maybe I should focus on the inspiration? People like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Katherine Hayhoe, David Wallace-Wells, Ken Hiltner, they inspire me by being leaders. My peers in this class inspire me, I love reading the hundreds of incredibly insightful comments left on these videos by my classmates. It gives me hope that as we become the leaders of this world, we can make changes with the best interest of our planet in mind. As for what changes I want to make and see implemented? I think a very efficient biofuel combustion engine might be the best switch for the short term because it would be easier than full electric conversion. I would love to see schools mandate education on the climate crisis, it's absolutely ridiculous that some children are being told by their science teachers that climate change is a hoax. We need a global shift towards plant-based diets, meat is unethical and unsustainable. Truthfully, I feel that the problem runs much deeper than public ignorance. There is a systematic and deep rooted issue with the way the actual science is being completely disregarded by the general population and opinions are based solely on the words of political party leaders, who likely have a vested interest or don’t understand the science themselves. Advocates for climate reform are being silenced on the issue by corporations who hold control of our capitalistic society. I really don’t know what the solution is, it’s scary. I cling to hope that my little personal actions, and those of my environmentally conscious peers, will be enough to sway the future for the betterment of life on earth. I’ve found comfort in a quote by Cloud Atlas writer David Mitchell; “What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?”.

<p>
Dear future me,            <br><br>

  I hope you are doing well. I don’t know if you’ll remember taking this class, or any of the classes you’ve taken in this school, but you learned a lot of important things in climate change that you should remember. I know you are probably busy, but I hope you have been taking the time to find ways to lower your carbon emissions. I know you like eating meat a lot, but please find the time to try at least cutting out a lot of beef from your diet. Being pescaterian is even better. You like fish and seafood a lot anyways. I know you probably are not vegan, but I hope you start eating more plant based options. I also hope you are conscious of your diet choices, remembering to buy more seasonal food options (i.e. eating asparagus in winter is still really bad for the environment even though it’s a plant). Food is one of the most immediate changes you can make to help the environment and you should take advantage of that.
            <br><br>
The next thing I hope you’ve been working on is changing your mode of transportation. I hope in your time, public transportation has taken off and the government is working on creating more accessible modes of public transportation so you are not taking a car everywhere anymore. Or even better, we have developed safer bicycle lanes and you are able to bike easily to work and closer areas. Instead of airplanes (only on the rare occasion of travelling overseas), I hope you have been taking the train to reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere. I know that planes are quick and much easier, but in order to preserve our environment, you should be using more environmentally friendly options like trains even if it is slower. I know you don’t really use planes right now, but I don’t know if you will in the future, so please keep this in mind. 
           <br><br>
 Another thing is housing, I hope that if you own a house, you choose a house that is more moderate in sizing. If you live by yourself, a small apartment is perfectly workable and if you have a family, then there is also no need for a huge house. Make sure you use heating and cooling in the house moderately, and install solar panels if it is within your abilities to do so. I hope in your time renewable energy sources are much more prevalent and common. Even if they aren’t, I hope you are still choosing to use renewable energy sources as they are much cleaner and better for the environment. When buying things, only buy what you need. If you are buying clothes, opt for a thrift store instead of retail stores. They are cheaper anyways. If you have children, please make sure you have two or less. Having children isn’t really your dream, but if you happen to end up having them, make sure you don’t have too many and overpopulating our earth. Also, please use contraception in instances where you do not want to have children. We do not want an unwanted pregnancy in our hands. 
           <br><br>
 I hope you are voting every year, as it is an important thing that you should be keeping up with. Even if you don’t find it interesting, you should be keeping up with politics and what different representatives believe in. You should be acknowledging candidates that will support climate change and other progressive movements and vote for them. Without your vote, people you don’t want running your country will continue to reign over it, implementing legislation you don’t believe in that aren’t helping. Not only should you vote, you should be telling others about what you have learned in this class, informing them (if they are skeptical) about the impacts climate change will have on our world if we do not take action. As someone with knowledge, you should be doing your best to spread the knowledge to those around you and working with them so we can all make change together. 
           <br><br>
 While I know you haven’t really taken a part in activism before, I hope you are trying your best to devote some time into that now. I hope you are supporting not only environmental activism, but also things like feminism. As you know, the education of women is something that would greatly help our environment, and honestly is something that they just deserve as human beings. As a woman, you know that it isn’t always fair for us, and I hope you are taking action to combat the unfairness of it in this world. We are all equal, and women deserve all the rights that men have. I hope in your time, women in all countries are earning the freedom they deserve and are being educated accordingly. As a woman, you must fight for other women and we must work together to create the fair and just world that we envision.
           <br><br>
 This letter although is for my future self, I hope my present self understands that it begins with me, right now. Actions start now, and I hope in the future when I read this, I will be proud of what I have accomplished and made a difference in the world. Please live well and work hard to achieve the things you believe in. As long as you try your best, I am sure that everything you set out to do can be achieved.

To My Family,
           <br><br>

In the Year 2020 I took a class at UCSB, Climate Crisis 101, that changed the way I went about my everyday life. This class had a massive impact on me and pathed the way for our family. 
           <br><br>

In 2020 the planet was at the highest global carbon emissions ever recorded, the highest recorded temperatures, the south pole was melting, and sea levels were rising which endangered many cities including NYC, Venice, and Miami. The world was freaking out from the very real threat of global warming which was caused by ourselves. Before Taking this class I was just like the rest. I didn't really think about my actions or how it would affect the environment and planet. I would drive my car by myself, I would fly short distances, I would eat lots of meat, and even sometimes litter. Taking this class immediately had a huge impact on the way I lived. After finishing this class I biked as much as possible, became vegetarian, reduced the amount of flying, and became very invested into climate change. I never realized how one person could make such an impact. 
           <br><br>

So let me tell you guys about the steps we were taking in 2020. The decade of The Green New Deal was launched which was aimed to address climate change and economic inequality. The main part of the deal was to reduce the amount of fossil fuel we release into the air and switch to renewable energy. At the time many people were afraid it would cause more poverty and everyone in this business would lose their jobs. This as you know now was not the case and the switch to renewable energy opened up many job opportunities and as part of The Green New Deal everyone in the fossil fuels business was protected. 
           <br><br>

It is now 2060 and everything is much better. We no longer worry about global warming and panic over climate deniers. We can live happy after fighting the climate crisis but eventually winning. The Green New Deal played a massive role in successfully defeating the climate crisis, so did our generation and Bernie Sanders. Our generation was more than ever invested into the climate crisis and felt responsible for reducing carbon footprints. The first step our generation took was helping elect former President Bernie Sanders into office. President Sanders was a huge climate change supporter and he lived up to his promise of helping defeat the climate crisis. He supported The Green New Deal which steered us away from fossil fuels and pushed us to use renewable energy. This as you know now worked and is the reason we are all still here today and thriving.
           <br><br>

I hope my family learned something by reading this and I am so happy I contributed my part to help defeat the climate crisis. 

</p><hr>


<p>
I try to be realistic, you know this.

           <br><br>

We were too young in elementary school to fully understand what the Earth Day festivals were all about. I remember wondering why we dedicated an entire day to celebrating it, because who in their right mind would hate the planet? I didn’t complain though, since a field trip was a field trip regardless of if I understood why. 
           <br><br>


I won’t lie to you: even though we knew why we shouldn’t drive around so much and pay more attention to the “Recycling”, “Compost”, and “Landfill” signs on trash bins instead, we simply didn’t do it because it was… easier. It was easier to toss a sandwich wrapper away in a random one when you were running late. It was easier to ignore the anxiety and guilt that came with thinking about the climate. It was easier to talk around it and go, “yeah, the weather’s been pretty crazy lately... I’m kind of worried”, and then hurry on into your house where the heating was turned all the way up because of the snow. We were creatures of convenience and 2-day shipping, you see.

           <br><br>

You might be wondering why we didn’t act, even after this course we took was dedicated to giving us the tools and information to just do something about the situation, and all I can say tell you is that we were too uncertain. We weren’t sure if we could convince enough people to see our point of view. We weren’t sure we could really forget the taste of red meat. We weren’t sure if simply voting for politicians who felt the same way as us would be enough.
           <br><br>


We weren’t sure if our efforts would genuinely halt the climate crisis in time.
 
           <br><br>


And then one day, we were just a little too late. You know this.

I really liked your message! It seems very realistic in the fact that we are just not hit with how big climate crisis is. Everyone is saying we will make big changes, but look at us now; do we really see the world changing and starting to be more environmentally conscious? This is not to say that none of us care about the planet, but just that we don't feel enough panic to make these shifts in our lifestyle, and perhaps we will not know until it is too late. Everyone wishes to live comfortably, and sadly most of us (myself included) will not sacrifice comfortability over the impending climate crisis. Although we all say we want to, will we really take the train and transfer multiple times and walk to get to our destination, or will we shamefully take the car we have owned for years? I really hope we do make a change, but I do not want to be a hypocrite and call out others, when I know myself and those around me are not trying their hardest either.

<br><hr>
I like that you take on a nostalgic perspective, so I will attempt to do one with a hopeful future in mind.

           <br><br>

Dear future me, 
           <br><br>

You may see in several years from now, so I would like to properly set the scene for you. I am currently writing this as a first year in my dorm room after weeks of learning about climate change and the hope for our future given we align with several new principles that can be more environmentally friendly for us. The world has gone mad. Outbreaks of the coronavirus leave us secluded in our homes. I am also, while writing this, cleaning out my room and boxing all of my stuff to go home. In the midst of this chaos, I will continue to remain calm and sensible. 
           <br><br>

I do wish that you are in a better place. where you can look up at the sky and tell that that it is shining blue. Where you can talk to people, not disconnected fools. Where love and value is placed on who you surround yourself with and not what. I hope that you can breath in fresh air. I hope that you can embrace the nature around you knowing that no animal is being harmed by human actions. 
           <br><br>

I don’t know exactly where you will be years from now, provided that the world has not yet rotted away. If it helps, I can try to guess. You will be in an apartment, probably still studying because learning never truly stops. Your family and friends are still a phone call away. You have started planting more things, become an amateur green thumb. You have groceries from the farmer’s market instead of the store. You have everything you need and nothing more. And all is enough. 
           <br><br>

The little child we used to be wondered where this planet will be later on. I know that she would be disappointed seeing where I’m at. But I know she would be smiling with rosy cheeks seeing where you are. 
           <br><br>

Even out of the context of climate change, I hope that you continue to recognize your worth and your influence on everything around you. Everything in life all starts with you, no one else. Ultimately, happiness still rests in the connections you make, not the things you have. Your heart will lie in places where you can work wonders with all the love it can muster. I have faith in all that you will do. Until then, surprise me. I can’t wait to see everything you have done and will continue to do. 

Sincerely,            <br><br>

eighteen year old you

A letter to my future self:

           <br><br>

It is 2020. I am here writing this letter. Things have been a mess recently. Yesterday I was still deciding between living on campus and moving out to an apartment to take online courses for the spring quarter. Today, after receiving the email that extended remote learning until the end of the quarter, I have booked my flight back home. I should be packing and saying goodbye to friends, but I am here writing to you about climate change. 

           <br><br>

After taking the class, I come to realize more and more that climate change is related to my own life. I thought of minimalism and happiness that I learned from the class when I stared at my room and contemplated when I would be able to entirely clear out my room within the next couple days. I bet I would find many items that I haven’t used in the past month, and perhaps I have even completely forgotten about some of them. I would get rid of them and hopefully find them some new owners who will use them more than I do. I will pay more attention to the quantity and types of things that I throw into the trash can or into the recycling bins. I will organize my clothes and think about when I bought them and how often I actually wear them. 
           <br><br>

After taking the class, I have also made the decision to fly less and less. However, this time, I have to acknowledge that I am flying because I don’t really have another choice. I don’t really have a place to stay here at school, nor do I feel safe here. I have been talking to my parents every single day, with all the changes that happen so fast. I know that I am increasing my carbon footprint substantially and I feel guilty about it. However, this time, rather than flying business class, I am only flying the economy class. 

           <br><br>

Recently, I have also been consuming less beef product. I avoid eating beef in the dining hall when I have other choices. I have also been drinking almond milk instead of whole milk. Those changes are actually easier to make than I have expected. I am a little surprised to realize that beef is actually not that important for my diet. I am glad that such relatively easy changes can be made to change our planet for the better. If I have not taken the class, I would have just thought that helping with our planet involves huge actions that are difficult for individuals to carry out. 

           <br><br>

I don’t know what it is like in the future, but I think anything is possible. As the saying goes, “we can be whatever we have the courage to see.” I can imagine a world with the merging of country and city. I can imagine the half-Earth. I can even imagine the Green New Deal coming true. My imagination is limited though. I know the future can go beyond my imagination. It is definitely full of possibility. Perhaps right now, right here at the moment, I should think of what I can do, what I will do, what others will do, and embrace the future.

2060 seemed so far, but the years just flew and flew until it was suddenly here. I wanted to write to you for various reasons, but I want to focus on the climate crisis- something I know you were concerned about. 

           <br><br>

First of all, relax. Obviously, I'm writing to you from 2060, so we've managed to survive thus far. But it wasn't without a lot of work! In 2020, we were headed down a dangerous path. We had a president that only cared about the money in his pockets, not the people he was leading, or the next generation that would have to deal with his inaction. The odds seemed against us, as the older generations did not fully understand the consequences of their actions- how could they? They would never have to deal with the effects of their mindless actions, they were only concerned about themselves and their short-term happiness. Greenhouse gases were entering the atmosphere at an alarming rate, we were incredibly reliant on oil and gas, and things looked like they would never change. Consumer culture was out of control. Meat intake was high. And the natural disasters were only starting; they would only get worse and worse. Farmland was running out, and climate refugee populations were only rising. In short, we were screwed. But, hope wasn't all lost. We dreamed of a Green New Deal, a societal upheaving of our past reliance on fossil fuels, a new way of life that was healthy for us as well as our planet. It seemed like it would take a miracle. 

           <br><br>

And, it was. It started with a cultural change in the younger generations. We, as a generation, became more aware of our impact on the Earth, and it became "trendy" to respect the Earth and practice sustainable lives. We "thrifted" almost everything we wore, which slowly started to wear on big corporations and the money-hungry businessmen in charge of them. Because the demand for fast-fashion fell, and the want for sustainable clothing options rose, we were able to make them switch from employing workers for little to nothing to actually paying them to make high quality, lasting clothing. In turn, this reduced clothing waste, and the people of Hati are still recovering from American clothing waste, but it is said that they are likely to recover economically, and the clothing will be recycled. So all is well, and everyone has a KILLER wardrobe. Along with that, the succulent trend exploded. People became interested in growing their own food, and we all shared our progress online and supported each other in our gardening activities on social media platforms, not unlike Twitter and TikTok. The effect of this was less store-bought items, more healthy living, and an even bigger sense of community. The carbon emissions from flying in food, and processing single-use plastics was almost non-existent, as well all became "climate-arians" in a way. You, personally, adopted a freeganist lifestyle, as it turned out it saved you a lot of money post-college. Who could have guessed? We started to carpool more to reduce carbon emissions, to rely on our communities and each other for transportation. And, in doing this, we started to connect more as a community. We became friendlier, we started to create groups to borrow items, and our interactions increased. We were finally actually seeing each other. And wow, it is so nice. We live in smaller spaces, mostly co-housing. It feels like we've returned to the way things are supposed to be. We actually communicate with each other, we are nicer, kinder, more empathetic. 
           <br><br>


But, these weren't the most important things. Using social media, the youth organized. We stood up to big corporations, to those that didn't care about our future. We started a global phenomenon, and it rose up and up until it reached the top of the most powerful countries in the world. And it was rocky and hard, and we spent a lot of time spreading information and convincing others, but it worked. Using effective communication, we fought the climate change deniers, one group at a time. We organized and voted, and picked candidates that listened to us and fought against fossil fuel corporations. Slowly but surely, we won. It started with the taking back the Senate, and passing the Green New Deal. And from there, the movement just kept growing and growing.

           <br><br>

Our Earth now is beyond beautiful. The wildlife has returned, the sky is clear, we've incorporated mass transit into our daily lives, and your kids will live to see polar bears! All is well, and it's thanks to so much hard work. So keep fighting, because change is possible :)

A letter to my future self,
           <br><br>


The year was 2020 when I took UCSB's Climate crisis course. It was my first course that described the real threat of global warming to the planet and how it might affect my life as well.  Global warming has had observable effects on the environment such as an increase in overall temperature, accelerated sea level rise, and the shrinking of glaciers. People still drive cars for transport and it was simply unavoidable as it continues to destroy our atmosphere zones. Now its 2060, and the world has been coming together to combat global warming. Millions of people use public transportations and bicycles to cut out emissions. Education has been key to this change as there are many more platforms to utilize to spread our knowledge about climate change. Through social media and other ways, we are helping to protect our planet by educating others about the dangers and how it can affect us in our lives. Politicians are being elected that help combat against the disruptive effects of climate change. Being able to vote for the right people into office is very important because they will help fight against negative corporations that are mainly to be blamed for for global warming. There is an increase in recycling numbers nowadays. It converts waste materials into effective and usable materials.  I make sure to turn off lights  unused electricity and unplug unnecessary devices that aren't being used. I even replaced my light bulbs to energy-efficient bulbs to conserve energy.

Dear Future Self,
           <br><br>

It is currently the year 2020. In case you don’t remember, you thought that the year 2020 could be the beginning of something great. You imagined that Bernie Sanders could win the democratic nomination and maybe even beat Trump in the presidential election. You were even hopeful that the climate crisis movement would gain momentum and that your generation would band together to save the planet. You were beyond excited for your first spring quarter at UCSB and, most importantly, you were finally starting to feel at home and form friendships that would last a lifetime. Unfortunately, things didn’t really go to plan, in fact everything went to absolute shit around the beginning of March.
           <br><br>

It’s not just that Biden dominated Super Tuesday or that young voters did not turn out as much as expected or that it rained on you while you were biking that made March an all around horrible month, a little virus called COVID-19 has shifted global focus from fighting the climate crisis to controlling a literal pandemic. Now, instead of coming together to combat one of the biggest issues we have ever faced as a species (climate change), people are wrestling in Target stores across America for the last roll of toilet paper or for an $11 thing of hand sanitizer. The worst part? You have to leave UCSB, your friends, your team, your home, and return to the very conservative, very boring town of Paso Robles.
           <br><br>

And that’s all I can tell you for now. Whether or not we get our crap together and save the world is a complete mystery to me. I can only hope that wherever you are reading this right now, you’re in a world where something was done to combat climate change.

Best,           <br><br>

The Future You 
           <br><br>
It is the year 2060 and, before I get into it, I promise you that things have indeed changed for the better. 
           <br><br>
In 2020, we were facing a massive, yet underestimated problem: the Climate Crisis. This was a controversial topic person to person due to the confusing media surrounding it and what politicians and oil businesses wanted us to believe. Science shows that the rising temperatures are anthropogenic, however climate skeptics continued to convince the public that this was a hoax and a way for leftists to gain control, take money, and enact a socialist society. 
           <br><br>
The Climate Crisis was much more than just rising temperatures and uncomfortable heat. It was the sea level rise, wiping out some of the world’s largest cities along with the homes of millions. It was the ice caps melting; the temperature regulators of the planet that reflect sunlight back into space are shrinking and the ocean absorbs that heat, worsening the feedback loop. It was the developing countries having little to no chance of survival as their homes are swallowed by the ocean, plastic, or the loads of donated clothes by the developed world that assumes they’re helping as consumers. It was the extinction of thousands of species, and numerous species daily with the choices of adaptation, migration, or death. It was the permafrost melting and releasing back into the atmosphere the deadly diseases that once wiped out our ancestors. It was the ignorance of the developed world blindly contributing to a deteriorating world that affected everyone.
           <br><br>
As our professor reiterated in 2020, his generation knew about these worsening effects for decades, yet there were no significant changes--at least not in America. We frequently refer to Denmark as an example of where we could’ve beeen as a sustainable community: bike lanes, co-housing, phenomenal bus systems, local gardening, a climate footprint label on food, and more. Denmark was able to achieve these changes through the activism that convinced local governments to accommodate, and later these changes became popular throughout the country. This was our inspiration here in America. However, we faced powerful politicians who had no economic incentive to help this crisis. The problem doesn’t stand in the confusion of how to help the crisis, science pointed to the actions that we needed to take. It’s the numbers and voices that we needed. The acted upon knowledge of the people is the power that’s required to take down these world monopolies, as they don’t only affect Americans, but the lives of billions around the world with their practices. 
           <br><br>
So here’s what happened in the 2020s: the Green New Deal. In 2020 we rooted for the Democratic takeover of the white house, and it happened. However, it took a while to transition into a sustainable country. The court cases were endless as environmentalists presented evidence that proved the severity of the climate crisis. Environmental activists stepped up as the possibility of a sustainable future was in sight and achievable, but it took a few years to activate. By the end of 2020, there were switches to sustainable energy. Slowly the Green New Deal was put into effect so that people could adjust to the changes, and was fully activated by 2023. We still have a ways to go, but we’ve stopped our emissions in America fully in the 2050s. We’ll continue to see the effects of global warming, but because we’ve stopped out 25% contribution, we’ve made a huge difference for the planet’s future. We’ve seen the sea level rise in Bangladesh, Florida, the San Francisco area and many other locations globally, but these people have been safely vacated and reside in nearby countries or states. Doctors and medical professionals have prepared for outbreaks in disease and illnesses, though we haven’t yet had to face anything so lethal and uncontrollable. The ice caps have significantly reduced in size, but they’re still here in winters and we’re hoping to see them grow in the next decades. 
           <br><br>
Local communities have strengthened due to the carbon fee and the improved bus systems and new bike lanes. Our buses here in California resemble those in Copenhagen, and 60% of workers use them to commute! The other 40% walk or bike to work daily. The public transportation systems have been improved all over the country, but started in states and counties where sustainability was valued most, measured by local votes.This has been a monumental change because individuals are aware of their emissions and bring awareness to their jobs. It’s a beautiful cycle of communication and action to prepare for the future. 
           <br><br>
Although we still suffered many losses with the intense warming, we became the change. There’s still much more work to do globally, but our nation has truly blossomed. The power of the people is greater than any politician, corporation, or tradition.

It is March 2060. I just celebrated my 60th birthday, and I am looking back at my life, reflecting on the journey I've lived. Growing up in a world facing a detrimental climate crisis, I feared what the future would be like today. I am relieved to tell you, we are doing just fine. The climate crisis was a major problem in the 2020s. Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were contributing to a warming planet, and a potentially uninhabitable future. Fish were dying, coral reefs were dying, the air was becoming too dangerous to breathe, and people were dying, particularly poorer people of color. The oceans were rising, cities were at risk of eventually going underwater, and people were worried about a mass climate migration and global overpopulation. Wildfires broke out almost daily into the 2030s, when effects finally began being reversed from the efforts the world governments invoked in the 2020s. It all started when Bernie Sanders got elected President of the United States on November 3, 2020, along with a wave of young, queer, women of color congresswomen from the Justice Democrats movement, a movement of progressive young activists dedicated to social justice, economic justice, and climate justice among other issues. Our first progressive president in nearly 80 years, America chose a new path forward, a better vision for the future with Senator Sanders leading the way. As President, Bernie Sanders signed into law groundbreaking climate-oriented legislation passed by the newly elected Democratic Socialist controlled Congress, as well as legislation creating publicly funded elections to ensure corrupt, corporate special interest groups could not "buy" politicians and elections. Over his two terms, President Sanders corrected nearly every wrong that Presidents Trump, Obama,  and Bush perpetuated in the 2000s and 2010s. He established Medicare-For-All, tuition free public college for all, universal childcare and Pre-K, legal marijuana nationwide, and lowered the voting age to 16 (since he believed young people deserved more say in determining their future). After Sanders' highly successful eight years as President, a prospering America, determined to continue the path of progress, elected the first woman President of the United States in November 2028, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who also ended up serving two highly successful terms as President. AOC as she was nicknamed was honestly the best President I have seen in my lifetime. She made America the leading figure on the global level tackling issues of climate justice, LGBTQ+ rights, women's rights, and equity for all. 

           <br><br>

I sit here today looking outside at the beautiful beach to my left and the beautiful grass field to my right. The ocean, blue and clean, flocked with healthy, prosperous fish and coral reefs, surfers riding the waves, enjoying the sun and the clean air. The grassland with wind turbines that along with my solar panels fill my home with energy. I see the electric railway in the distance, and electric planes in the sky. The sky is blue and beautiful with billowy, white clouds, and the warm, bright, yellow sun. There are no wars. Everything is perfect. I hope you are enjoying it as much as I am.

<p>

To my past self in 2020, 
           <br><br>

The year is 2060. I just turned 59, and our children are in the same point in their lives as you are now. I've lived a long life, and much like Nana, I have come to know a lot of things. Instead of lecturing our children on all of the things I wish I did differently and all of the things I would never change for the world, I thought telling you would be much more beneficial. 
           <br><br>

Don't choose to be complacent in a world that is actively being killed by your species, especially when you have access to so much information. Be mindful of how much you consume, whether that's meat, technology, toiletries, or other household items. I know you love the taste of cheeseburgers and steak. I know you desperately want the newest and greatest phone. But you need to remember the impact that your choices have on the people around you, and the environment. This doesn't mean I want you to live without. You can buy yourself that new video game, the car you've always dreamed of, or the In-N-Out burger that you desperately crave. But all in extreme modesty. As I'm sure you are starting to realize, the government is incapable of handling crisis with swift and decisive action. It is too tied up in wars for oil and keeping up the façade that America is a land of luxury to have the extra resources to prevent disaster. As with Covid-19, the government will not do enough to stop the looming threat in enough time. For your future to be bright, you must take responsibility for your part of the climate crisis.
           <br><br>

Doing your part to combat the climate crisis isn't just controlling your own actions, but educating others. I know that having these kinds of conversations, especially with our family, can be tough. With every passing day, Mom and Ian seem to become more and more conservative. They buy giant SUV's for a family of 5, buy lots of food and drinks with disposable packaging, and care little with regards to how much they pollute. Doing nothing to educate them is a disservice to not only the planet, but to our kids. The world that I live in, the world that our children have inherited, is worse than you could ever imagine. Our family was forced to leave California in 2033 because of the increasingly dangerous wildfires. The bluffs of Isla Vista that you cherished so much have completely eroded away, and UCSB was forced to shut down. But leaving California isn't a good enough solution. The Midwest is unforgiving, and the influx of climate refugees has caused extreme levels of poverty for most Americans. No amount of war can stimulate the economy enough to help this problem.
           <br><br>

All hope isn't lost, however. Doing you part to combat the climate crisis by educating others and altering your choices can do a lot to mitigate the effects of climate change. But if you can do one thing different, be active. And I don't mean work out. Be active in your local government, in larger politics, in school, in your community. You have so much to give, and have so much to learn from those around you. The opportunities that are available to you as a UCSB student are not available to everyone, so take advantage of them. You have the power to make a difference, don't muck it up.
           <br><br>

I hope you take this advice, not only for your sake, but for your wife and children's. (And yes, you will eventually get married. I don't want to ruin the surprise, but don't second guess yourself!)
           <br><br>

Best,
           <br><br>

To my 2020 self:
           <br><br>


I am writing from 40 years in the future, 2060, to warn you about the drastic lifestyle changes you will have to make in order to combat the climate crisis through mass collective action. I remember at your time the Green New Deal wasn't taken very seriously and legislation was grid-locked in achieving sustainability goals. With so many climate change deniers dominating the media, you felt hopeless and discouraged. However, as the science predicted, snowballing natural disasters and home displacement due to rising sea levels took control over society. The environment was directing where we were going next, because it was decaying right before our eyes. As people started to carry real fear (of course a very much delayed response), environment preservation was the largest priority. After the economical recession in 2021, following the coronavirus pandemic, our rising generation held their beliefs strong while the generation above us slowly started to convert to environmentalism. Whether it was out of selfish or compassionate reasons, it doesn't matter; for once in forever, it felt like everyone's vision was hazy and blurred, and suddenly the science was clearer as day. The solution? Completely flipping the way we live upside down for the good of cleaning up the huge mess we had created.
           <br><br>


In light of global disasters and emergencies, both social and environmental, sweeping legislative measures were performed. From global emissions caps, alternate transportation infrastructure, weening off of dairy and animal production, ecosystem preservation measures, and much more, our planet was deadset on a brighter future. I know it sounds scary to rearrange how you live normally in our capitalistic society, but you realized that once everyone else was focused on the same purpose, it strangely felt easier to sacrifice the things that made you "happy". You, under some federal backing, stopped driving your gas-guzzling childhood car and gave biking to work a go. You ended up loving the daily exercise and the friends you made on your bike route. Also, you now eat an entirely plant-based diet! When local vegan restaurants started dominating the scene, it was not so difficult anyways. You purchase your whole foods at a local farmer's market that sits right next to the community garden your neighborhood established. Along with being plant-based, you are simultaneously zero waste. You only buy disposable things if they are a necessity. Regardless, single-use  plastic products have reduced by 80% and fast-fashion businesses are coordinating environmentally friendly and morally ethic business practices now after suffering dramatic sales drops and being threatened with bankruptcy; supply by demand! 

           <br><br>

Stay positive that the world is going to become a much better place, trust me. 2020 was a devastating year, but that was our rock bottom. A few disasters later, and we ave realigned our strategy to save our planet. Your individual action back then, such as spreading climate crisis information to your family and friends, participating in activism, and incorporating small changes into your own personal lifestyle helped more than you know. Everyone's accumulated actions have made a huge difference. Don't give up, and keep chasing an attainable future where fear will not prevail because we stood up and used our voices to change.

A message from the present to the future, 
               <br><br>
   It’s hard to imagine that there’s a future where we dug ourselves out of this perpetual hole of rising global temperatures, ice caps melting, emissions increasing, forest coverage receding, species extinction rate accelerating, natural disasters intensifying, but despite all of that, human action remaining complacent. If you’re reading this 40 or 60 years from now then that means we were successful, which is comforting to know. Esteemed scientists and climatologists told us that we have to keep warming below 2 degrees celsius and the ppm of carbon dioxide is safest at 350ppm. At first, we didn’t take this seriously. Even with 97% of scientists in agreeance, we refused to make any real and lasting changes that would benefit our planet. Somehow, global warming and the climate crisis became a political issue as the public began to lose sight of what the end goal was. Fossil fuel interests have spent millions on funding climate denial literature and spreading the false prophecy that climate change wasn’t human-caused. The animal agriculture industry held power over our politicians and brainwashed them into continuing to provide subsidies for meat raising and producing. On the other hand, animal rights activists and environmental groups rose up to battle these climate injustices. Our nation was divided between those ruled by the power of big companies and those pushing for more sustainable practices to be put into law. For the rest of us, we were lost in this haze of not knowing what was true about climate change and what wasn’t. This atmosphere of confusion left us in inaction.
           <br><br>
      None of this is an excuse for what my generation and all the generations before me have done to this planet. The way we left it on its last legs and abused it for our own gain. As Richard Sommerville would say, “we had our hand on the thermostat that controlled future climate”. We failed to aid mother nature when she called out in pain, so she gave us signs of her hurt. Hurricanes became more frequent and more deadly, fires obliterated everything in their paths for a longer season of the year, species everywhere were losing their habitats either due to ice melting or forests being cleared, our whole planet was hurting and it was all because we couldn’t face the truth. The truth is that our species caused this crisis but we also had the power to stop it, that is if everyone came together. 
           <br><br>
Slowly steps toward lasting change were being taken and people were sharing their stories of how they became more sustainable and how it was actually making them happier. The strongest ever environmental community began to rise up just in time. New movements for renewable energy, freeganism, biking, minimalism, decarbonizing, and climate policies were popping up everywhere. Finally, in the 21st century, long after we started down this road of environmental abuse, did people finally start demanding action. Members of our government listened to us and drafted up The Green New Deal which promised a plan for weaning our country off of dirty fossil fuels and moving toward net-zero emissions. Of course, this would be no easy task and many people would lose their jobs as the whole basis of our economy would be turned upside down. But they planned for that too. They promised to fight systemic injustices that would arise from this plan and to provide for those who would be put out of work as a consequence of this deal. Our government knew what they were doing when they created this. Unfortunately, our president at the time was among the group of people who still didn’t believe climate change was real and refused to even put climate policy on his agenda. I doubt he even read The Green New Deal. 
           <br><br>
       Other countries were baffled about how the U.S. could so ignorantly go about our practices despite the extremely obvious signs that global warming was only getting worse. The United States, one of the biggest if not THE biggest contributor to global greenhouse emissions, was doing nothing. Places like Copenhagen were improving bike infrastructure to move their citizens away from car use. South Korea had implemented a food waste tax in order to incentivize reducing food waste. Iceland was now almost completely dependent on geothermal energy as its power source and Costa Rica used renewable energy to produce 98% of its electrical energy. The Netherlands and Norway had passed a carbon tax, something our government at the time could never agree to. Even in countries like Columbia, there were cities implementing better public transit systems that made it more efficient for people to take the bus or the train rather than drive their own personal car. The TransMilenio system in Bogota is a prime example of that. Despite all these countries around us making sweeping changes, the U.S. couldn’t commit to anything.
           <br><br>
        Now when I say the U.S. I really mean our government, those who held power over policies and the funding for public projects. As individuals, there were tons of us who decided to take our own journeys to battle climate change despite the lack of support from our government. Things like Project 333, which is a movement towards the minimalism that Henry David Thoreau emphasizes, and co-housing became more popular as we were looking for anything we could integrate into our lives in order to make it more sustainable. Individual action was at an all-time high, but it wouldn’t be enough on its own to halt climate change. Political action and collective action followed close behind. Rallies and marches protesting our continued use of fossil fuels had high turnouts. The push to make education and family planning more accessible to all girls and women, not just those who can afford/are fortunate enough to grow up with access to it, inundated the inboxes of our congressmen. Finally, after decades of silence, the public was speaking and we were doing it loudly.
           <br><br>
       At this point, while I sit here writing this, I know we’re nowhere close to saving our planet and that there’s so much more that needs to be done. With the damage that we’ve done, the only thing that can save us now is a revolution. But if 60 years from now there’s someone somewhere reading this, then I know that there’s hope. Take the crisis that’s plagued my generation as a lesson. We have to change our human habit of mistreating our resources and being devotees of consumerism. Our planet cannot sustain that type of lifestyle and in partaking in that lifestyle we put the existence of our entire species and the species around us at risk. Don’t wait to act, because by then, it may be too late.

Dear past self,
           <br><br>

When you wrote this, it was the year 2060 and you were remembering the time when you were typing up the final comment for your favorite class during winter quarter of freshmen year, Eng 23. There was a nice sunset outside when you were brainstorming what to include in this letter to yourself when you realized that, there could eventually be a point in your lifetime when the sun would no longer shine on the same Earth on which years and years of your ancestors populated and you yourself were born on. This makes you feel sad and worried for the future, but then, you remember that almost everyone else here at UCSB taking Eng 23 is probably feeling the same way. You are not alone in this movement against fracking, beef production, automobile production/use and many more polluters of our Earth, even though sometimes it may feel like you are. 
           <br><br>

 You were a college freshman- you didn’t know much about the world back then but you had enthusiasm, enthusiasm that only someone young and passionate can have, which helped drive the youth’s fight to end the climate crisis. This class brought about a sort of impending feeling of doom to you and your friends and so you all decided to join protests (such as Greta Thunberg’s climate protests). The writings of David Wallace-Wells were the most inspiring to you, specifically the first article that you read that was written by him (the article that was given to us in class), “The Uninhabitable Earth”. Although his writings made you feel depressed and less hopeful for the future, you took the truth of his work and turned it into your fuel to become an environmental activist. One of the most influential thing for you that  Wallace-Wells included in “ The Uninhabitable earth” was the fact that there is a chance that climate change, when it melts the ice caps, could release diseases like the bubonic plague, which was extremely scary for you because it could mean the almost instant extinction of at least a significant amount of the human population.
           <br><br>

It took some time but, by the time 2030 came around, you had been an environmental activist for almost 10 years and, after a long, hard battle between the Democrats and the Republicans, The Green New Deal, created in 2006 by the Green New deal task force, was pushed by both Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders from a well-thought out plan for the future into a reality. There were 5 goals of the Green New Deal, but the most important thing that the Green New Deal brought about was the achievement of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by fair means, which was accomplished around 2040. Other parts of the Green New Deal were also implemented and achieved, some quicker than others, such as the stopping and preventing of the historic oppression of native peoples, people of color, foreign people, etc. and the securing of freshwater, healthy foods, and similar needs of all human beings.
           <br><br>

What happened after we implemented the Green New Deal? Well, let’s just say that life became much better. In almost every way possible.  People started to live in micro apartments if they were living in the city or in co housing anywhere else. The Green New Deal almost completely eradicated the use of cars, except in some of the richest areas of the U.S., such as L.A. (specifically Beverly Hills), but they soon followed after being bullied on social media primarily. People shutdown beef manufacturers and almost every family had either their own garden to grow fresh, good vegetables and fruits or they had access to a large community garden. In this new day and age, people had to stop relying on technology and they had to actually spend time together to build trust in order to survive and build real relationships that could be depended on. It's almost as if we turned back the clock- we had perhaps gone too far in our technological innovation and had to take a few steps back to survive the aftermath of our extensive destruction of the earth and its resources.
           <br><br>

By 2050, we faced the final pushback by the big corporations that we had been slowly chipping away at for a while but had still managed to retain some power. By this time, they had formed a coalition and they tried to essentially stage a coup of the American government. But, although these companies had a lot of wealth, wealth meant less and less during the time and there was no way that their dirty schemes could compete with the sheer power of the people. Once these corporations were taken down for good, we finally began to see life get better for everyone. Now that there was no longer this looming dark cloud, we could rebuild our government as we saw fit. Women finally got the rights that they deserve, people of color were no longer discriminated against by the police, from specific jobs etc., and more and more sexualities were considered socially acceptable.

           <br><br>

Now, in 2060, I truly believe that life is so much better. Everything that was wrong during 2020- people not getting the rights that they deserve, no one ever really talking to each other because we all prefered our phones over other people, and families spending less and less time together- all of this was almost completely reversed by 2060. And for this I am so thankful. I just wanted to write this letter to you to let you know to never give up hope. Life will get better, even though it looks pretty bleak right now.
           <br><br>

With love,           <br><br>

Your future self

Dear future self, 
            <br><br>

 Right now, and in this moment specifically, you and those around you are in a time of uncertainty. This fear, real enough to warrant evacuation, is not caused by fire or air quality or anything familiar, though terrible,  like the others. This evacuation and rising chaos is caused by a novel form of panic taking the name of the Coronavirus. We began as UCSB to gain a degree in Environmental Studies and then go on to change the world through what we are passionate about, the good health of our Earth. Being here, we took classes like environmental studies, and the Climate Crisis 101. We learned through the classroom the facts and truths behind the science of the climate crisis. Through CALPIRG, we were able to gain leadership and activism skills while working to make actual change in the world. These are the tools for success we had begun to learn here at UCSB, the tools we would need to help change the world to our liking, but our first year here was cut short.
            <br><br>
Though we might not have gotten to finish that last quarter, I hope you, my future self, take the tools we had just begun to learn and use them as building blocks so that you may continue to grow into the passionate activist for climate justice you want to be. I want to remember, individual choices matter, for it’s the actions of each individual that makes up the masses. Keep not eating meat! Stop buying clothes deemed fast fashion!  Stop using planes! Travel slowly, enjoying the ride. Keep following your moral compass and stick to the choices you know are true even when faced with ignorant opposition. Keep fighting for civic engagement and work to make the voices of all heard through voting so we can finally have a chance for a plan like the Green New Deal in place or people like Bernie Sanders in charge! Work to stop fracking and the meat industry which contribute so heavily to greenhouse gas emissions! Keep spreading truths and facts of the climate crisis so there are few deniers left. Keep educating yourself, and growing with compassion so you may positively influence others. 
            <br><br>
I know in this moment the future seems so uncertain, and not just because of the current epidemic at hand, but because of the unstable fate of our Earth’s health. This climate crisis is uncharted territory and there is no set plan for how to make it right. Though it is easy to shut down or get lost in the chaos, I use you as a lighthouse in the dark. I imagine myself forty years from now, feeling content with my actions and choices in life, knowing I did good work that I believed in and gained enough wisdom to spread for the well-being of future generations. I have hope that as I grow, so will humanity and we might come together and solve the climate crisis.

<p>
40 years ago, in 2020, I took English 23 at UCSB in order to satisfy GE requirements. It satisfied the literature requirement, and was titled "The Climate Crisis", which I figured was about as good as it was going to get for a literature class. I was absolutely right. The class was easily the best I had taken at college, even if it was just my second quarter there. The class got me to change the way I thought about my role in the world. It opened my eyes to the environmental consequences of my actions. Before the class, I thought that my lifestyle was better than most in terms of affecting the planet, but I was absolutely wrong. I thought that being vegan was a pointless trend that people followed to feel good about themselves,  one that made them feel like they were better than everyone else. I didn't think I needed to change anything about my lifestyle to stop the climate crisis, I just figured some geniuses would figure it out. 2020 was the year that I realized that I needed to do something.
            <br><br>


2020 was the first year I voted. I voted for Bernie Sanders at the primary democratic elections, which he came back to win, and again at the presidential election. Bernie was the only candidate that I believed would actually push for policies that would curb climate change, so I voted for him. Thank goodness he won. 2020 was not the year that the climate crisis was solved, but it could have been the year that pushed us as a planet past the breaking point. If any other candidate had won and been president, I firmly believe that the majority of the world's population (of all species) would be here today. Others would not have taken as much action as Bernie did in his two terms as president, and America's carbon footprint would have continued to grow. However, as president, Bernie was able to put forth policies that created positive change. He did not completely solve the climate crisis, but he got the ball rolling. After we as a nation took action, other countries followed suit. After all, if the United States made these changes in 2020, as stubborn as we were, why couldn't other countries do the same? After Bernie's two terms, the presidents that followed continued to make progress towards evolving the United States into a green country. By 2036, we relied completely on renewable energy. The renewable energy industry replaced the fossil fuel industry as the country's superpower. People were no longer kept in the dark about the consequences of their consumerist lifestyles, as I was in my youth. In 2043, scientists began saying that there was no longer a climate crisis.

            <br><br>

In 2020, I began making a lot of personal changes as well. The English 23 class I was talking about made me feel guilty about how I lived my life, and made me want to change my lifestyle. I was never much of consumerist, but I began being even more self-conscious about what I bought. I made sure I absolutely had to have something before I got it. I tried making things I had, like clothes and phones, last as long as I could. I began looking for items that were made in a way that was environmentally-friendly. In 2021, my diet became largely plant based. Instead of only avoiding meat for one day a week like I had before, I only had meat one day a week. Unfortunately, I could never get myself to quit dairy, and to this day I still am not vegan. I definitely respect vegans a lot for what they do now, though. I never bought a new car. After my first car started falling apart and was no longer worth fixing for financial reasons, I committed to only using environmentally-friendly public transportation. I always rode my bicycle when I could. I think I can honestly say that that class I took at UCSB was a huge turning point in my life. I began considering the consequences of my actions not just on myself, but on others, even people I did not know and would never see.
            <br><br>


Today, in 2060, I look back on the last 40 years with great pride. We as a human species did what very few expected us to do. We along with the majority of life on the planet, survived.

A Letter to My Future Self:
            <br><br>

The year is 2020 and we are in the early stages of panic regarding the climate crisis. It is our time to act right now. I have concerned myself more with personal action and I have been doing my part to combat the climate crisis. In particular, I have given up red meat, I have moved towards a more climate-friendly diet, eating local food instead of imported fruits and veggies. I have been consciously aware of the amount I have been driving and decided to use public transportation when possible in addition to giving up non-essential flying. Living in Isla Vista while attending UCSB is a great way to live more climate-friendly, sharing spaces with my roommates and having to learn to co-habit a space with more people. I am currently learning how to ride a bike for the purpose of not only exercise but to be able to use it as a mode of transportation as well. 
            <br><br>
Right now the earth is sidetracked with the COVID-19 and countries are helping out each other, which gives me hope that we will be able to work together for this issue as well. I would like to again say, as I have said time and time again that the climate crisis should not be a political issue. It is not a matter of if it's happening or not, because it is happening, and we need to take personal action. The little things can help, and they do, like turning off the lights and switching to solar, but hopefully, in the future, we have more of a plan. I hope that technology gets behind this movement because I'm not entirely sure that as humans we will give up everything that we need to give up in order to make this happen. I hope that for all children, my children, that we are able to make this Earth habitable for the generations to come. Unlike the generation before mine, we are aware of what's happening and we know the magnitude of the problem that we have created, and we know the steps that we need to take to resolve it. I'm just not sure if we are, or were, able to get enough people on board. 
            <br><br>
In ten years I hope that we have put money into making this a solvable problem. I know that this is where most of the politics come into play, but considering the nature of politics in 2020, I wouldn't bet a lot of people are switching to one side over the climate. I plan to, in the meantime, continue to be personally active and do my small part as well as encourage others to do the same. The United States has put out so much of the CO2 in the atmosphere and I figure that we are personally responsible for changing that as well. I know it's hard to get the generation that essentially created this on board, considering that they won't be around to suffer from the consequences, but we must think less selfishly. 
            <br><br>
Hopefully, we have created or found a community where we have support from fellow vegans and climate change activists. Hopefully, we have put policies and reforms in place that help us to stop the progression of the climate crisis, or at least slow it down. Hopefully, we have gotten it through people's minds that just because we are able to afford something, doesn't mean that we have to buy it. We don't need to prove to everyone that we are able to afford large houses and fancy dinners, instead, we can live within our needs. Not everyone needs to switch to a minimalist lifestyle. We don't need to give up everything that we have, but instead, we should be more mindful of the things we are buying and how much we need in general. We need to stop fossil fuel emissions. We need to only have two or fewer children. 
            <br><br>
I would also like to say, for anyone else who may read this, if the children thing rubs you the wrong way, as it did me, as I always envisioned myself having, there is a huge foster care system that we have the ability to help. You can still have two kids, but if you want a larger family, do a meaningful thing and help some kids in need. You will not be exceeding your two kid "limit" and you will be giving a child a chance to have a stable life. 
            <br><br>

I am hopeful for the generations to come. I am hopeful that we were able to take action. I am hopeful that we will be able to combat the climate crisis. 
            <br><br>

A message from the future:

            <br><br>

The year was 2020 when people first started to understand the true ramifications of continuing on living the way American's lived at the time. It wasn't uncommon to see people driving SUV's getting 8 miles a gallon, nor was it uncommon to see people thinking they were saving the environment by driving "Teslas" which proved to be more destructive than beneficial. When the contents of English 23, "Climate Crisis 101" finally broke ground into the public and people learned what they could do to truly save the environment, progress skyrocketed.

            <br><br>

By 2025 beef sales dropped by 90%, chicken by 50%, and fish and eggs by 30%. People started to realize that a plant-based diet was the best thing for their health and environment,  and rather than trying to forget about this newfound knowledge, they took action. Micro-apartment sales skyrocketed, and the real estate has been declining ever since people discovered that a big house wasn't the meaning of life or the path to happiness.

            <br><br>

By 2028, the entire American government was on board with making a change in the climate crisis, whether democrat or republican. The green new deal was enacted and everything seemed to be running smoothly.  By 2035, the United Nations implemented strict regulations to dramatically slow down carbon emissions.

            <br><br>

Fast forward to today. It is 2060 and actions have been taken to clean up the environment. Not only are our carbon emissions not increasing, for the first time in history, humans have discovered a way to clean up the atmosphere. We run entirely on green energy, and places like Beijing and Delhi have crystal clear air. It is looked down upon to eat beef, in the same way it used to be looked down upon to smoke cigarettes in my generation. Through this world effort to save the planet, people are more connected than ever before. Crime is down, poverty is down, lifespan is up. There is not a single gas powered flying car to be seen. Everything is self-sustaining, public transport and health care are all free. I knew we would have a bright future, and I'm glad everyone had hope it was possible.

            <br><br>

Most importantly, everyone is happy. People are less worried about making a living, and more focused on being alive. Where am I? Here. What time is it? Now.

Dear Myself: 
            <br><br>

 I am still remembered in 2020 had a bad beginning. In the first three months of 2020, everything seems to be going wrong around the world. The world is facing the threat of a new type of coronavirus. This coronavirus had already caused 2199 people died and 61518 people confirmed.
            <br><br>
 As a developing country, China has made great progress in improving its public health system and response mechanism, although there is still room to improve. When the novel coronavirus epidemic broke out, quick and efficient responsive measures followed. The novel coronavirus was first reported on Dec 31 when 27 cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, Hubei province. China has not only spared no effort in identifying the pathogen and learning the full genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus but also has wasted no time in identifying the pathogen and sharing the full gene sequence of the novel coronavirus with the WHO, earning valuable time for the world. Indeed, the epidemic should not be a barrier to state-to-state communication but a catalyst for strengthening international cooperation. At least, China was trying to do so. 
            <br><br>
 At this time, our campus was closed, and this spring quarter had changed to remote instructions. Although more and more people paid attention to coronavirus, fewer people would wear masks in public. I was so sad to see that, and I hoped everyone to wear masks not only for themselves but also for other’s health.
            <br><br>
 This year was really important for our planet. I still remembered Professor Ken standing in front of the lecture hall at UCSB at that time. He showed us many comments and real data on the screen. However, not so many people would like to act at that time. They thought everything would be alright after technologies developing. But things changed, our planet could not wait for changes and actions. Although people asked people to protect our environment, people still did daily actions and did not care about it. I was glad that I knew those climate crises in my undergraduate time. 
            <br><br>
 Finally, I hope my future will be better than my imaginations.

Dear future me,
             <br><br>
I hope that this letter finds you well, More importantly, I hope that you are still alive and have not been wiped out by aliens or Vulcans. If my math is correct (it’s terrible most of the time), you should be receiving this message in the year 2060 and should be 59 years old. At the time of writing this letter, I made a very important decision. This decision that I made was to take a course at my university that dives headfirst into the issue of anthropogenic climate change and what I can do to stop it. At first, I can admit that I knew almost nothing on the issue. I was even at a point where I was questioning whether climate change was real. Yes, I was a part of the skeptics. Typical me, right? Needless to say, this course opened up my third eye. It gave me insight and information of just how terribly we were ruining our one habitable world with our poor choices. It showed me real life examples of these drastic effects, like the treacherous Thomas fire that ravaged many. Taking this course made me ponder upon my own choices and life decisions. It made me want to change my ways, ways that would be more eco-friendly and ways that would ultimately reduce my carbon footprint. At this time, I have chosen to be a flexitarian. I am hoping that this later evolved into a vegetarian diet, and even later, perhaps at your time, into a vegan diet. I questioned what it meant to be happy, and whether living a consumerist lifestyle was the right way to live. I hope that you found what it is that makes you truly happy. I hope that because you found a lust for life and whatever it is that makes you happy, that you switched to a more minimalist lifestyle upon coming to the realization that material wealth means nothing. I hope that everything learned through this course sticks with you. I hope that others around you also acquire this mindset. At the time of writing this, much of the world seems unconcerned with this issue. We are battling a deadly disease known as COVID-19. Because much of the world is focused on this, not much is being done about our climate. It’s not only that many are unconcerned, it is also the fact that many individuals just chose to turn a blind eye on this issue in hopes that it would fix itself. I am hoping that things have changed, and that this issue becomes widespread and prioritized upon. As the effects become more drastic over the course of these years, people will definitely start to notice more and the concern will rise. I hope that action is taken before it is too late. As you know, the effects of anthropogenic climate change don’t show up instantly. Hopefully leaders and those in authority took action over this issue to mitigate the crisis. If not then, then hopefully you and your community inspired others to form a movement and spread the ideals and solutions to fixing this crisis that we are in. I have faith in you and believe that action is taken so that you, and your kids may live in a healthy earth.
            <br><br>

To my future:
            <br><br>

                       The year is 2060. It is crazy to know that I will be turning 60 by the end of this year in October. It is shocking to me how fast the years have passed by because it feels like just yesterday, I was attending college and living on DP how we all do at UCSB at one point. By this point, the houses on DP have been destroyed by the eroding rock which is crazy. I am now 60 and have lived my life to the fullest and am happy. It is bittersweet knowing college was so many years ago. I have been through a lot of tough situations by this point, but one major crisis we were going through in college was the climate crisis. Everybody was careless in 2020 and we were rapidly destroying our planet at this point. The carbon emission were skyrocketing through the years and it looked as if extinction was inevitable. A lot of it had to do with the fossil fuel industry as they are carelessly polluting the air since the 1950s up to 2020. 
                   <br><br>
         They were so careless because the effects hadn’t kicked in immediately until the Earth quickly started warming up and there were lots of consequences. People just didn’t seem to care much and they kept doing the daily norms at that time which included things like driving cars EVERYWHERE, eating lots of meat, buying tons of clothes for no apparent reason, and lots of other small things. There were times when I felt really hopeless for the planet because not much was being done. Well known politicians weren’t using their power to help alleviate this problem, including our president, Donal Trump, who was a businessman and lived off business. It was hopeless as oil continued to be dug up from the Earth which didn’t help at all. It took years for the world to come into sense, but we all finally did which was vital in helping save our planet. 
                   <br><br>
          One huge step that was extremely essential to help alleviate the climate crisis was electing the right politicians who truly care for the environment. This was huge because they hold lots of power and passed a law which had a very structured plan on how to reduce the majority of fossil fuel burning. As soon as we were able to reduce our carbon footprint by 50% in 2 years, many other countries like Europe and China followed. Many people began to use bikes more and more daily after many cities followed Copenhagen in the use of bikes over cars. The governor of California spent millions of dollars to build safe bike paths and began reducing money on building roads for cars which made everybody want to use bikes instead since it would be faster and more effective. As far as travel goes, people used electric buses that helped save millions of carbon release. This was possible due to a law that was passed which made buses free. Taxes went up a little bit, but it was a form to provide free service. Since then, we took a huge step in reducing carbon emissions which slowed the warming and by 2050, our polar ice sheets were beginning to increase in size at a rapid rate. There is still a few things we need to fix to help avoid our species from falling into this again, but I think we will be good. On this note, I wanted to say that I am proud of where you have gotten in life and hope you continue to exceed your expectations.

AOC message to the future was a great little short video. I really liked her video because is showed what the possible future might look like If the US decides to wake up and do something about the climate crisis. This video really brought out what could be the possibility of the future could be if change begins. Like ken said there is still time to act in order to help the planet. 
                    <br><br>
A message for the future,
                   <br><br>

So, let’s begin with 40 years into the future the climate crisis. Everyone decided that the planet has had enough. It took a lot of fight from activist that have had enough of being pushed asides by those who have power. Both personal and collective action took off as Bernie Sanders took the office in 2020. Everyone came to their sense and new that change needed to start. In order for change to start people knew that Sanders was the way to go. Bernie was the only candidate that said it how it is. Climate change is a huge issue and he was the only one that new and saw the severity of it took a lot of fight but environmental activism took off. The green new deal was passed and was implemented. This meant that there was a carbon tax that was implemented which really help reduce the carbon emission. The whole US economy changed drastically but for the better. The transition to clean and renewable energy was hard but doable. More jobs were available in order to transition from fossil fuels to clean and renewable energy. The economy started to slowly but surely transition to renewable energy. It was hard to do this because of the capitalist consumerist culture that the US has. But since the US had created this consumerist culture it was the US job to fix everything that is has done. The US knew what it needed to do with the push of the people. 
                   <br><br>

Not only did the US started and did transition to clean and renewable energy but the people also knew that in order to also help the climate crisis was to make personal change. It took a while but people started to transition from eating meat to a largely plant base diet. It was hard people many people fought this, but the tax that was imposed on eating meat and imposed on the beef/ agriculture industry made this possible. Personally, I look at myself as a climatarian. From the day that I started to take English 23 have seen and changed my lifestyle for the better. Taking that course really changed the way I live my life and made me conscious of the how I was harming the planet. I have stopped eating meat all together and so has my family. Also, on a goof note finally one of the biggest problems has been address without any repercussions. The agriculture has so many regulations that were imposed on them by a government that now cares and help its people. It has taken many years but people are now have almost completely stopped eating red meat. There has been so much activism in order to eat the eating off all type of meat but that has been a battle that has continued till this day. On that note Education has also been something that has changed for the better. Not only is education free but also the women and girls have been educated and can take complete charge of their bodies. BY educating everyone now things like population control was address and is not as big as an issue as it was before. Myself and a good amount of people that I know made the decision to not have children. That is a decision that now is seen as good rather than sad, and is rather popular now a days. Not only has did the US act in time to help prevent the biggest disasters that could have happen but it took initiative as and responsibility for all the damage it has done. There is still a lot more to do but the future certainly took a go in the right direction.

Dear Future me,                   <br><br>

At the time of writing this, it is March 2020. I am 21 years old and the world is rapidly changing. I am writing this message after having finished taking English 23 at UCSB. This is a course in which I learned a whole lot. I really hope my 61 year old self has abided by the things that I am about to make my goals. In this course I have learned about the ill effects humans are having on this planet. From a mass scale (corporations, companies, policies) to an individual scale (how I consume things), I realize what a big responsibility me and my generation have to try to change the culture and bring about real change. At the rate we are currently going at, the future looks a bit bleak. Ice continues to melt, sea levels continue to rise, CO2 levels as well as the global temperature are rising as well. Despite this, there are people, young and old, who continue to deny that climate change is real. Now I am going to talk about what I hope happens and what my peers and I can do. 
                   <br><br>


First and foremost before anything can be done people must be educated and accept the facts. I really hope the talk in the near future will become less of “is climate change real or not” and more of “what can we do to slow/stop it” from happening. In order to do this we must first educate ourselves and then others. Once we do that legislation is the next key aspect in our fight against climate change. We need to get people in office who will fight for this earth. We need policies like the Green New Deal to be implemented. Once things like this start happening significant change will be evident.

                   <br><br>

On an individual level, I hope to start (and stick to) some key lifestyle changes that may help bring my carbon footprint down. I am hoping others of my generation will lead the change in their lifestyles so others can follow suit. For one I want to carpool as much as possible. By getting food with my friends vs each of us individually going to different food places, we cut down our emissions by a lot. Simple things like cutting down on buying excess clothes/items will also help me decrease waste. I also want to take shorter showers and turn off the lights whenever they are unnecessary. 

                   <br><br>

Anyway, I hope by the time I read this, all of the above things I mentioned will have all taken place and this earth won’t suffer some serious consequences of inaction (increased famine, poverty, anarchy, war).




</p><hr>


<p>

For my children:

                   <br><br>

I write to you from the year 2020.  This letter will find you at the age I am now, 18.  You have reached adulthood.  Inevitably you are finding yourself at an age where you hold the potential to make a difference in this world, in your life and the lives of those around you.   

                   <br><br>

When I was your age the world was dying.  The environment was shutting down at an increasing rate.  For the past 60 years, the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere as put there by humans was rapidly increasing.  The generations before mine had put us into a terrible position.  The ice caps are melting, the temperature is rising, the animals are dying, and the sea levels are rising.  

                   <br><br>

I am in my first year of college.  I go to school by the beach, where the cliffs that I will be living on are at risk for erosion due to climate change.  Here, we have seen drastic weather changes, not normal for the climate we are in.  The county in which I live has oil rigs that we can look out on at night, and as a result of, whenever we go to the beach there’s tar throughout the sands.  This isn’t the worst of it, but it is the immediate things that I can see just from my bedroom.  

                   <br><br>

As I have been going to school here, I have done my best to do what I can to make a difference.  I am writing to you from a Climate Crisis class, where I have been taught in more detail the dramatic impacts that humans are having on the world, and the changes that I can make to improve these declines in the environment.  You were likely raised pescatarian, as I have been for ten years now.  In fact, I hope that I raised you vegan, and I eventually reach the point of eating entirely plant based myself.  At the moment, I am eating pescatarian and milk-free.  I bike to school and to work.  I take public transportation over car.  I slow-travel more often than I take planes.  I just voted in my first election, strongly influenced by the climate, voting for officials that I know are dedicated to making a change in the environment.  I am trying to be the change I wish to see.  

                   <br><br>

I write to you because of this.  I don’t know at what state the world is when you are reading this.  I can only hope that my generation has done our best to clean up the mess of the world that our parents left behind for us.  I want the best for you, and I want you to grow up in a world where things are better.  You have the power to make a change.  I don’t know what struggles your generation will face.  It’s likely that my generation will leave some other kind of mess that you will end up being responsible for.  So, do your best.  Take it upon yourself.  Make personal changes in your life that can make an impact, but also know that your voice in election is very powerful and you can make differences that way as well.  


All my love,                   <br><br>

I imagine a future where the majority of people on earth have the same mindset about climate change, where we all live smart and sustainably.
                   <br><br>
On 03/13/ 2060, I will be visiting my neighborhood community garden, where everyone grows their own vegetables and herbs. I’ll pick some carrots and go to the local market to get some ingredients.  Go home and turn on my solar powered oven, bake a delicious carrot cake. Then I’ll take my electric bike and cruise the city with my friends.
                   <br><br>
Through decades of climate activism and goals achieved. The city is now powered by renewable energy. I see not so many cars, mostly hydrogen powered buses. I see many bikes and e-bikes moving on the street.  I see bullet trains that take you coast to coast in 3 hours. 
                   <br><br>
And it’s so beautiful, looking up with trees lined up all along the sidewalk. I see beautiful parks that grow tulips (yes tulips in America). I see tall buildings that build with strong, compostable bricks, and there is a garden balcony at every floor. 
                   <br><br>
I see children running, playing and parents walking their kids. I almost forgot how people don’t work as much anymore, the average is 30 hours a week, and people get so much more leisure time to themselves. Workers get to have vacation breaks and online work. A lot of people spend that time travelling slowly, visiting different destinations with their electric car, e bikes, or buses. Some take sea travel to other continents. 
                   <br><br>
I see local clothing stores and a beautiful innovative Westfield Mall. The mall is run on 100 % renewable energy, and clothing is all recyclable or compostable.  I see many vegetarian, freegan restaurants. I see compost bins on every corner of the streets  and  a few compost sides in the neighborhood. These compost places give you free planting soil for the compost you turn in. 
                   <br><br>
I see the NASA station where you take a ride to Mars Planet, home of the other half human population. I take frequent trips now and then to see my family. I prefer living on Earth, where I was born. I’m very happy!

Dear Future Me,
                   <br><br>
It’s 2020, and I am in my second year of college. Winter Quarter, I decided to take a class on climate change that changed my thinking completely. You were always environmentally conscious, but taking the course made you realize how uninformed you were and how much more you could help. 
                   <br><br>
How does the world look like now? Is the air cleaner, the oceans clearer, and the land less crowded with landfills and trash? I hope there are less natural disasters as well. In fact, I know that it got better. I have hope for the future. I am so excited to find out for myself how the world and its people have changed.
                   <br><br>
I hope that you kept doing all that you learned in ENG 23, and you are actively being a better person for the sake of the planet every day. Every person living on the planet has equal responsibility in maintaining the Earth’s wellness. I also hope that everyone else around you has realized that saving the planet is our utmost priority.
                   <br><br>
I almost hope that the world has redefined their relationship with material things and gave up on the lavish lifestyle. The industrial revolutions and age of technology ushered in a wave of materialism and wastefulness, but I believe that we can start a new age. An age where we realize the beauty of nature. Nature allows us to breathe and survive, so we should do our best to keep it healthy. 
                   <br><br>
Lastly, I hope you are happy and you are living comfortably. With a family, with kid(s), perhaps. I want you to think about how far we have come and be proud of what we accomplished as a collective human race.

A letter to my future self:

                   <br><br>

I am writing this in the year 2020. By now it should be 2060 by the time you opened this letter. 
                   <br><br>


Right now I am at the end of my winter quarter at UCSB, and I must say that this has been the craziest quarter ever, next to fall quarter 2017 when the Thomas fire here. We are currently dealing with a coronavirus pandemic. I hope by now nobody has to worry about going to work or school while sick. 

                   <br><br>

But I digress.

                   <br><br>

The point of this letter to you (future me?) is to let you know what's happening right now during our climate crisis. I've been inspired to write this letter by one of my professors, Ken Hiltner. I am currently taking his English 23 class (which is actually titled Climate Crisis 101) and this was one of his ideas for us to do for our final writing assignment. 

                   <br><br>

This is what's happening right now:

                   <br><br>

Bernie and Biden are fighting for the Democratic nomination right now, Trump is still in office, and we as a country aren't really doing much to combat climate change. While we all saw and read the Green New Deal, it's nowhere close to being made law. I think that it is more of a symbolic legislation rather than an actual law. I hope that by now, we would have taken drastic steps to curb our carbon emissions. 
                   <br><br>


I learned how each and every one of us can make changes in our daily lives that would lower our carbon footprint. I learned how much waste we make buying clothes and goods. I learned how critical and how little time we have to act for this crisis. 

                   <br><br>

But what I've learned is that we can still do this. We can still be the change. We can still see greener pastures. 
                   <br><br>


This class has inspired me to think about what things I could do to lessen my impact


I pledge to:                   <br><br>

-Use reusable utensils                   <br><br>

-Buy only what I need                    <br><br>

-Reduce any clutter I have                    <br><br>

-Eat less meat                   <br><br>

-Talk to my friends about doing some of these things with me 
                   <br><br>
-Fly less
                   <br><br>
-VOTE MORE
                   <br><br>


I hope that everyone has changed into a healthier, eco-friendlier lifestyle by the time you're reading this. 
                   <br><br>
I also hope that you have learned way more about the world and the climate crisis. I hope that you have made the right decisions regarding this. 
                   <br><br>


I know that I have used the word "hope" a lot in this letter. But the type of hope that I am talking about is the hope that spurs change. What I want to see, in 2020 at least, is to have everyone actually start to pay attention to the climate crisis that we are in right now. 

                   <br><br>

Only then can you have a future that is sustainable. 



                   <br><br>

Good luck and thanks for opening this letter

A letter to my future children,

                   <br><br>

It is 2060, and I am extremely amazed and happy at how much our environment has gotten better. You weren’t alive yet, but it was not always like this.

                   <br><br>

In 2020, I took a class called ENGL 23 or Climate Crisis 101 where I learned about how dangerously fast people are making our Earth heat up and how the heating of our Earth would result in many horrific disasters such as unbreathable air, outbreaks of disease, huge fires, dying ecosystems and animals, and more. Taking this class has led me to make personal changes. For example, it was this year (2020) that I decided I would slowly cut out beef, and then eventually pork, and chicken which actually ended up taking me 3 or 4 years to accomplish. I also put off buying a car and decided I would take public transportation to and from work. And lastly, I stopped buying from fast fashion websites and stores and thrifted my clothes instead. From everything I have learned, I knew there were so many people blaming the boomer generation for what situation they have brought upon us, yet they didn't take any action to undo them. But, there was a growing population for Gen Z and millennials pushing for environmental action which was amazing to see. I decided to take part in this environmental movement by signing petitions, voting for candidates who supported the Green New Deal and other actions that would further protect our Earth. I was hoping if everyone made changes in their individual lives it would add up.

                   <br><br>

By 2030, our CO2 emissions actually skyrocketed. Our planet has already had several pandemics, a wildfire or massive flood in every country, and in some countries, it was not safe to go outside without a special mask or to go out in clothes that would make the air come in contact to our skin. Our planet was dangerously toxic--almost apocalyptic. We did notice that certain countries such as the Nordic/Scandinavian countries were almost completely fine. Nearly every country decided to adopt a Green New Deal and strictly implement these changes. Desperate times really did call for desperate measures. It was illegal to fly more than twice every 5 years. Production of cars came to a halt. It was not illegal to drive, but on every road tolls were set up so payment was required every time someone were to drive. Meanwhile all public transportation was free. Additionally, any and every store that bought their clothes from sweatshops or other workplaces where conditions were unsafe and workers were underpaid was shut down. Oil drilling was limited or even completely stopped in certain places. Overall, almost every single factor that resulted in high emissions of CO2 were completely stopped or limited. There were people who tried to rebel against, but they were unsuccessful. Life was hard to adapt at first but as soon as people knew it was for the best, complaints stopped. 

                   <br><br>

By 2040, air became breathable. The laws and policies implemented back in 2030 were still being held. Fires decreased, flooding decreased, there have not been anymore pandemics. CO2 emissions fortunately plummeted. There was a point where people started to get too comfortable and demand back fast fashion stores and the removal of tolls on roads, but those luckily never went through. Additionally, it was the norm to own smaller houses which was another great step forward, but unfortunately, in the U.S. despite the norm of smaller houses, our culture of the American Dream and being rich and owning the latest gadgets put us behind every other country. We made a lot of steps in the right direction, but in comparison to all the other countries, we were still behind. But at least our air is now breathable and we lowered CO2 emissions. 
                   <br><br>


Now it is 2060, our planet has now been almost "healthed" back to life. Regardless of right or left wing, every political candidate is for environmental protection. I hope that your generation can keep this up. I am very happy to see how far we have all come.

It has now been 40 years since my eyes were opened to the reality that was changing our lives. Looking back, I am thankful to have been in a part of such an English class because without it I don’t know if would have been part of the problem instead of the solution. Even though the class was cut a little short due to the corona virus at the time, my classmates and I did not forget what we learned. After everyone returned to school for fall quarter 2020, the school and community help make changes to better the environment. Everyone started bicycling everywhere. There were more people on bicycles than cars driving on the streets. Also, public transportation has been incorporated into everyone’s daily lives. So much has seemed to change in these past years and not just in Santa Barbra but worldwide. Actions to better the environment happened everywhere and children were taught at a young age the right way to eat and live. My grandchildren have been living a plant based lifestyle and are healthier than ever. To this day they have not eaten beef and chicken is eaten only on special occasions. Making these changes has not been easy. It was hard for everyone to change, but it was possible in the end. Everyone’s contribution made it possible to have a safe earth for generations to come. I knew it would be possible and I’m glad that this change happened quickly. My generation really did make the change and I’m just glad I could be a part of it. Even though the job is not done yet and it will be a few more years to really say we are in the clear, I am happy and can confidentially say that I have no doubt that everything will be better than okay. Together we have worked collectively not only for ourselves but for future generations. So that they as well will be able to live long healthy lives.

Hey Yousuf. If you're still alive, you know that the year is 2060. It's been a wild ride the past 40 years, and you're reminiscing about the past 40 years. Your mind races back to where you where at the age of 20 and you remember that under appreciated GE class you took in your UCSB days: English 23 or Climate Crisis 101. 

                   <br><br>

I remember who I was walking into that large lecture hall. Climate change was a topic I was aware about, but I hadn't given it the same respect as I did by the end of that winter quarter. Ken wisdom left me with a sense of purpose in drive as a youth growing into an adult. More importantly, I felt confident in taking the steps necessary to fulfill my role as a Climatarian. Becoming full on vegan was a choice still scary to me. Giving up meat? I didn't think it was a choice I could stick to. I returned home invigorated about my civic duty to vote, and chose serve the climate crisis in that way. Every close friend and family member I knew, I made sure to bring up my own new knowledge, combining my feelings for serving the planet with my own family and religious morals: this planet is simply a borrowed possession and it's on us to return it in good condition. That summer I would look to reducing my meat intake to only eating beef once times a week at most, prioritizing a plant heavy diet. As working out and protein high meals had become a bigger part of my life, I would look to tune out my consumption of whey protein in preference of plant based alternatives. Unfortunately, the democrats would not win back the White House and my hope for a brighter future would be attacked. 
                   <br><br>

Over the next the next 10 years, through my journey to become a doctor, I would gaze upon the struggle against climate change with disappointment. I could recall my hope for enacting change through political actions like Green New Deal and the Paris Climate Agreement, however I'd be met with the reality of growing environmental turmoil year by year. My own individual efforts would stay relatively plateau'd in my stressful life, aside from being a supporter of climate change through my diet of little to no beef consumption, and by now a more minimalist approach to owning things. The rest of the world had caught up in combating climate change with growing social change in favor of saving the planet. It would be only now that the US would begin enacting climate change legislation with ideals similar to Sanders' Green New Deal. 
                   <br><br>

By 2040, the US, and myself faced growing cultural and societal change. Although going through a rough transition to a different culture, the US began to take more of a lead on combating climate change, catching up with the rest of the world. Fracking had quickly become a thing of the past as well as the agriculture industry faced a great many new regulations. I had found that culturally it was more of a want for "climate friendly" foods and products as opposed to the organic vs GMO craze of old. For once it had began to feel like the transition was heading in a good place; there was hope. In light of this, the world faced natural disaster after natural disaster. Coastal populations had become refugees, polar bears and other arctic species had gone extinct. Our planet was still crying out in pain from the actions of our predecessors. 
                   <br><br>

By 2050, I had a grown family of me, my wife, and my two children. The World economy was struggling with the continued onset of climate disasters. Many began to doubt the reforms we had made. Was it all for nothing? I had raised my children to be forward thinkers in their day to day life and how they can serve the planet. I had raised them to be vegan, but a developed efficient technology of growing beef and chicken in a lab (without the need of cultivating life stock) had become a widely used way of consuming meats. Carbon emissions in the US had been reduced by over 70% than what they were in my youth. I still found myself working extremely hard as a doctor to both support my family and my community, but I was content in my work that what i was doing was for the benefit of my kids, my community and the future generations. Ken would be proud. 
                   <br><br>

So yes, the year is now 2060. I'm here sitting on this old Trans American bullet train (man they really should update these) remising my younger days. People now are beginning to show anger at our desperation to save this seemingly bleeding world. There seems to be growing counter-movement yearning to explore space travel. With my generation slowly dwindling, it's intriguing and almost scary to see this new generation with their heads seemingly looking beyond, but not at what was right in front of them. It reminded me of me. I was so headstrong in my thinking, but horrible at following up with my actions at that young age. It reminds me of how we all were back then in my generation. We were angry at the world. Angry at what we had inherited, yet struggling to make it out of this wallowing pit of depression and fear of the future. Yet it was moments like i had shared back in that Climate change class that spurred me to look inward and tell myself "I need to change."  Since those fruitful days, the temperature has risen by about 0.5 degrees. Although still an increase, it's still a testament to how we wanted to  stand up and say "enough, it's time to be the change!" And we did.

<p>
To my future self,
                   <br><br>


Hey! I’m sure that when you are reading this, it will be roughly somewhere between 2050 and 2060. I hope that the journey to where you are right now has been fruitful, adventurous, and full of surprises, and I sincerely wish that everything has been well. I am writing this letter for you to read what my thoughts were in the past. 

                   <br><br>

I am writing this on March 9, 2020 in the San Nic office, and it’s my final assignment for a class that I took this winter quarter known as English 23, also known as “The Climate Crisis: What It is and What Each of Us Can Do About it”. This class has been one of the most life-changing classes I have ever taken, as it opened my eyes to the reality of the climate crisis and how everyday, our world is dying because of the lack of human action. I wholeheartedly express my gratitude for Ken, the TAs, and all of the students here that have helped me understand more about the global crisis.  


Currently, our beautiful nature and environment is slowly deteriorating. Wildfires have been raging across the planet, specifically in Australia, and natural disasters are continuing to occur day after day. Ice is melting in Antarctica and in the North/South Pole, and many third-world countries are suffering due to extreme hot weather conditions. Unfortunately, the US, which has been my home for over a decade, has not been playing a significant role in fighting the crisis, even though it is one of the major causes for the increasing number of greenhouse gas emissions into our atmosphere. 

                   <br><br>

Honestly, it seems extremely hopeless, and many people in the status quo perceive the crisis as a catastrophe that cannot be fixed anymore. However, it’s vital that we change this mindset. We need to understand that acknowledging and hoping that we can fight this crisis together can spark inspiration and a new flame to continue fighting. As Ken mentions, we can be whatever we have the courage to see.

                   <br><br>

The first step we need to take is to picture a world that is free from this climate crisis. Although I will admit that we should’ve acted 40 to 50 years ago, there is still time left for us to reconvene, brainstorm, and be innovative on how to fight this as a global community. Even if a small group of people started to do this, it can inspire others to take the fight too, and this can then spread throughout the globe.

                   <br><br>

One thing I want to mention is that it is absolutely understandable to be pessimistic and doubtful about this situation. There is no one in this world that would look at the current climate and crisis and think lightly of it. It is quite a difficult and laborious situation, but if we do this together, we can achieve what we imagined. Remember, it is important that we try, even if things don’t go the way we hoped or expected.
                   <br><br>


In the end, as you are reading this, I hope that you can confidently say that you lived a life that at least attempted to fight the crisis. Even in your 50s and 60s, I hope that you can continue to fight the climate crisis (if it’s still happening) and protect our beautiful home together.

I am writing to you from the year 2060. You live in a small yet beautiful home in Manhattan Beach with your husband. Your kids are grown up and have big-kid jobs and their own families on the way. Lots has happened since your sophomore year in college. In the Fall of 2019 there was the cave fire which was never a real threat to UCSB’s campus but it did give you quite a scare of what was to come. That winter break you went on a big family trip to Maui where you experienced some days of less than ideal vacation weather--pouring rain and wind. While these two weather fiascos were small incidents in your mind at the time you would come to learn that there is a reason for the odd weather and climate crises in your ENG 23 Climate Crisis Class that you took the Winter of 2020. You were pretty naive going into that class--still flying whenever convenient or cheap, buying lots of stuff, and going on your occasional “paleo” diets. Those ten weeks in Campbell Hall taught you lots though. Even though you were twenty at the time--and could have voted in previous years--you voted for the first time in the presidential primaries for Bernie Sanders. You learned that there is a real huge problem that is the climate crisis and people weren’t crazy for wanting to stop you around the UCen to “save the oceans” and join the “green teams”. You learned that this was very, very real. Professor Ken Hiltner was not only a professor but an example as to what the ideal climatarian should be and you realized if more people didn’t join this fight the next generations including your kids and kids kids would be doomed. You were especially inspired by the ACO film which gorgeously illustrated a vision for the future and how we would get to a better future. Honestly, we are not there yet but we are closer than ever before. Bernie did not win the election but the democrats did take power back. The Green New Deal was implemented in 2022 and people got serious. There was no more lying--big oil companies could no longer fund outreach that said the opposite of the truth. The public was finally better educated on the outcomes of this planet if we were to wait any longer. You started eating a lot less meat and realized it wasn’t even that bad. You enjoyed trying the staples you always loved with different protein sources--who knew tofu could be so good. You also considered housing when moving to graduate school and beyond--you wanted to be in a city so that you could take lots of public transportation and get around in an eco-friendly way. You also started thrifting a lot instead of buying everything new. You knew your parents would always support your passions so you had to let them know how you really felt about the families habits as a whole. We went on lots of vacations requiring flights, cars, and food--much of which got wasted in the end. You agreed to take less trips, but make the most out of the ones you did. In entirety, that one climate crisis class had a huge impact on your life outlook and habits that seeped into 2060. You enjoy the simple things in life like sunrises and sunsets, the people you love, the places you’ve been, and the memories you’ve made.

The year is 2020 and you're unsure about the future. Everyday I have less and less faith that the climate crisis will be resolved by any human efforts and the candidate that you have so much hope for is getting less and less delegates than the one who doesn't want to do anything about the climate crisis. Even though things look bleak myself I have to continue to fight for what we believe is right and for the future. I have to not lose hope and believe in the institutions that may have failed be before but fight to make them better.

                   <br><br>

What I did in the climate crisis was impactful. My name probably will not be known but for the past 40 years I have stuck to my young idealistic beliefs to help the environment. I hope I had a part to elect a politician that can actually help us and isn't just another cog in the machine. We will succeed in combating the climate crisis by continuing to fight and not losing hope.
                   <br><br>


You may see the world falling apart around you currently due to COVID-19 but do not lose hope. From what you have learned from CLIMATE CRISIS 101 you will be able to spread the knowledge you have learned and help other people to combat the climate crisis. Do not lose hope and continue to fight.

Dear Future Me,
                   <br><br>


I am writing this after my winter quarter taking Ken Hiltner's English 23 (Climate Crisis 101) class has come abruptly to an end due to the corona virus. Right now, it seems to be a decent problem as it's been announced a global pandemic, and more and more people are being infected everyday. Everything has been flipped; we're advised to stay at home. Crazy people are taking all the toilet paper and hand sanitizer but leaving the hand soap. I wonder how you'll look back on these times? Will you just look back and scoff, as it didn't end up having too much of an effect on our lives? Or do you laugh at how innocent I sound, not knowing what is about to come and how different my life is about to get. People joked around saying there would be a major pandemic in 2020 because 1920 and 1820 had their major plague outbreaks respectively. 
                   <br><br>

Everyone getting sick like this is exposing how bad our healthcare system in the US is. This class was supposed to teach us to fight the climate crisis currently taking place across the world. Is it something you think about nowadays at all? Right now, I don't make too many conscious actions to help reduce my climate footprint. I hope your actions reflect some kind of change in how environmentally conscious you are. If you are vegan, just know I am shocked for you. I also wonder what kind of changes you notice in the Earth. Are there more natural disasters of great scale? More support for the movement? 


                   <br><br>

Take care, I guess I'll be you one day.



</p><hr>


<p>
The year is 2060. 40 years have passed since I have learned valuable lessons from my former climate crisis professor, Professor Ken Hiltner. Before I talk about the state of our planet and what we have done as a society, I want to look back on how we got to where we are today.
                   <br><br>


1960 was the year our country found out the truth regarding fossil fuels. We realized that fossil fuels were destroying our planet. Even with this knowledge, the generation that came before mine failed to act on it. Like my professor used to say, knowledge not acted upon is knowledge squandered. As our country grew richer from continual use and reliance on fossil fuel, the planet continued to suffer. Despite all the good it has done for our country, this source of energy had a steep price to pay in order to use it. While our country has grown rich and powerful at the expense of the planet’s health, poorer countries suffered the consequences of our actions. We were slowly destroying our only home, yet no one seemed to care.
                   <br><br>


2020 was the year that everything changed for our country. Tired of the inaction and injustices experienced under the Trump administration, the American people voted him out of office. Voter turnout was the largest we have ever witnessed in the history of our country. We as a country spoke out and voted for a President that cared about the environment -- someone who put the interest of the public and planet first, not big corporations and fossil fuel industries. It was also the year that Democrats took back the Senate. With control of both the Senate and House, things were starting to look up for us. 

                   <br><br>

Under the administration of someone who wholeheartedly believed in the climate crisis, our country was able to bring about massive change. First, we looked to cities such as Copenhagen and Bogotá as role models and inspiration for our sorely lacking transportation system. We remodeled our entire public transportation system and invested in mass transit that was not only cleaner and greener, but more efficient. We also made major reductions to our carbon emissions by making our roads safer for cyclists. This huge change in infrastructure was costly and seemed impossible at first, but we pressed on. Never giving up hope, we continued to roll out thousands and thousands of miles of railways and paved hundreds of miles of bicycle paths all across the continental United States. This was only the beginning.
                   <br><br>


2030 marked the year that the United States was 75% reliant on renewable energy to power our entire country. In just 10 years, we have made leaps and bounds in terms of progress. 10 years ago, this seemed impossible, an unlikely reality. We became the role model for the rest of the world to follow. We stepped up when we needed to and spearheaded the coalition for greener energy sources. As we continued to invest in more renewable technology such as solar and wind energy. Our country was making its way towards 100% renewable energy.
                   <br><br>


By 2040, most of the developed world has followed in our footsteps. Everyone was doing their respective parts to combat the climate crisis. Those that were known as the ‘developing countries’ in 2020 were no longer that. They were rapidly expanding and jumped straight into renewable energy sources to power their country. Having skipped the process of having to rely on fossil fuels like we did in the past, the ‘developing countries’ were not far behind the rest of the world. As an entire species, we have all reached the same conclusion: we needed to act fast in order to save our planet, to ensure that there will be a planet for our future generation and their posterity to enjoy, just like we did.

                   <br><br>

And now we are here, the year 2060. The world is a much cleaner place, the planet healthier than it was when my generation inherited it. Lots of things have changed in just 40 years. No longer are there old coal plants running, releasing tons of CO2 and toxic fumes into the air. They were all phased out and the land repurposed. There are still some natural gas power plants in operation throughout the world, but they are slowly being phased out. As they reach the end of their lifetimes, these plants are being replaced by new ones, such as geothermal plants and solar power plants. All of our problems aren’t solved, but we have kept the impending doom at bay for hundreds of years to come. As long as our future generations learned from our mistakes and do not repeat them, life on our planet will continue on. It will never reach that level of uninhabitable that we have all feared just 40 years ago.

At dinner tonight, my 8 year-old grandson tried beef for the first time in his life. I told him that, when I was his age, my dad would grill steak for my brothers and I once a week. His response? “It’s good, but I don’t see what all the fuss was about.” Thinking back nearly 40 years to when I first started slowing my own meat consumption, I can’t believe how far we’ve come. It still feels like it took years to even make a dent, but switching to chicken, limiting myself to one meat-based meal per week, then two per month, and so on, eventually brought us to the system we have today. By the time my daughter was born in 2030, the government had followed suit by cutting agricultural subsidies and releasing a modified food pyramid with regulatory meal mandates based on sustainable food sources. I had gone from 4-5 meat-based meals per week (chicken, etc. included) to 4 per year, only on the holidays (and my birthday of course). Even so, I never could have imagined cutting such a major part of my diet out almost entirely. Furthermore, we had to wait longer and longer to give our kids, and now my grandson, meat and so I feared that they would feel they were “missing out.” But, as so many experts had argued for years, the switch was quite easy once you removed the expectation, and thereby the social construct, from the beginning. And now, taking a ride from Los Angeles to San Diego on the once revolutionary high-speed rail and seeing communal gardens on almost every corner that once housed a fast-food burger joint, I am so proud of our progress. 
                   <br><br>
Like with the fight over food, I think that the toughest part of the transition was a social one. So many people, whether it was entitlement, ignorance, naivety, or even fear fought the necessary changes for so long, but change prevailed. I remember taking a class in college that focused on the climate crisis and thinking that there was no way that everyone could make the changes it would take to save life as we know it. I was right. Life as I knew it in 2020 is gone. But life itself has prevailed, pioneered by passionate people like those who took that class, and I truly believe we are better for it. We are better for the renewable energy we produce after replacing countless acres of industrial livestock with wind and solar farms. We are better for reforesting almost half of the forests we had lost through ultra-urbanization in cities and further reduced agriculture and fracking/drilling. Sea level rise was so limited that I can even still visit my old house in Isla Vista. A few of the more outcropping houses on Del Playa collapsed or were condemned early on, but most of it remains. 
                   <br><br>
Most importantly, listening to my grandson shrug of a dinner that was once a cornerstone of the fight against day-to-day change, I can tell that things are only going to get better. Not only is meat an afterthought in the daily diet, but educational programs starting in grammar school have educated the generations after mine as to the importance of continuing to improve our daily practices and evolve our industries. And with the newly elected President AOC taking office next month, I’m sure it’s only going to get better. I’m just surprised it took so long for her to run. In fact, I can’t wait to see what the next couple of decades have to offer.

Hi, it’s the year of 2060, which are 40 years later from the moment I am writing down this letter. The only thing I know is that the world is a far more better place now.
                   <br><br>
With the passing of the Green New Deal, both the society and each individual living on the earth have made changes to make our environment better off. I am so satisfying with all the things around me now…Everything is on its right track.
                   <br><br>
Start from the Politics. The Government passed the Green New Deal, which is a huge step for the officials of the country to step into the climate crisis and use their power to change things. The budget of the government has been remodeled to different sections. More money has been devoted to improving new environmental-friendly equipments and technologies, educating the future generations especially girls, and etc. The government also passes a carbon fee which makes people more willing to take public transportations or simply walk to their destinations.
                   <br><br>
With the help of the government, people’s ways of traveling have completely changed. People walk, ride bikes. You can see people exercising, the smiles on their faces are the most pleasuring thing I see everyday on the street. Airplanes have decreased in a huge amount. People no longer consider flying as the best way to travel due to the huge carbon dioxide it produces. People no longer consider taking the first class as a way to show wealth. 
                   <br><br>
Besides transportation, our living environment completely changed. Many factories are being put down, as people don’t use that much of energy. You won’t see as many chimneys as you did in 2020. The sky holds its blueness and there are less foggy days. More trees are being planted, not only by environmentalists organizations, but each citizen. Planting tree is becoming an activity that everyone does now…I know you are surprised, so do I. But this is how we are making changes in 2060. Amazon isn’t disappeared yet. On the contrary, it is vibrant, vivid, green, lively, nurturing countless species that aren’t disappeared. 
                   <br><br>
Our lives change. Me being a 60 years old woman now, if I use one word to describe my life now, it will be “simple”. I live in a house, without many extra space. Nearly every square meters in my house has its own function. I grow a lot of plants at home, and my friends always say I am a botanist! I don’t have a lot of lights in my house, because I prefer the natural light to shed into my room. When decorating this house, I didn’t buy a lot of new furnitures. I bought a lot of two-hand, old furnitures which have the taste of vintage. 
                   <br><br>
Me and my husband, although we are not completely vegetarians, we seldom eat beaf. With knowing that the production of beaf creates the most pollution, we decided to eat other proteins instead to do good to the environment. 
                   <br><br>
We don’t buy a lot of stuff. Our clothes are simple, our furniture are simple…all about simplicity. And people around us are all doing the same. In 2060, Instagram is no longer hot through luxurious stuff competitions. Instead, now the hottest people on social medias are people living the low-key and environmental-friendly life. The fashion industry still exists, but now there are only several seasons, which can totally fulfill people’s needs.
                   <br><br>
We decompose our trash back in out yards. Talking about out private garden, we grow the food we eat there. We grow vegetables, fruits. We raise several animals there. We leave a spot for decomposing rubbish. Our private garden is expressing its usefulness and it’s so pleasing to eat personal grew food. Surprisingly, all our neighbors do the same! We exchange our food sometimes to check out which family grow the best food, which is so interesting.
                   <br><br>
Most importantly, we don’t have a car. I know it’s shocking to hear from 40 years before, but that’s what we do. We walk or bike or take bus to everywhere. With the carbon fee and the recognition that driving is so polluting, we give up buying a car in the first place.
                   <br><br>
Me and my husband, we only have one child. She is living with us, and she decided not to raise kid, which we 100% support her. We don’t think it’s necessary for her to have a child to make her life complete. And the world is having enough population, it’s ok if she don’t raise any child, but instead doing good to the society. 
                   <br><br>
Overall our lives have completely changed. Our everyday life and the whole society is nothing like your settings. We are improving, developing, in a good way, to make the planet more hospitable. I hope you are pleased to see all the changes. Don’t worry, 40 years later, the climate crisis is in control. We are making changes, we are saving the planet.

A message to my future self,
                   <br><br>

2020 was the year I realized we, as a society, need to change. I am writing this as a second year undergraduate student at UCSB after completing the course, English 23- The Climate Crisis. As of the week of March 8, 2020 chaos broke loose throughout the United States. The coronavirus is currently being spread rapidly all over the world. All lectures are cancelled right before finals week. This week is the epitome of how disastrous our world is becoming because of the climate crisis. Taking this course opened my eyes to how much damage we have done to our Earth. A quarter before taking this class, the Cave Fire in Santa Barbara occurred and I was fearful that I was not going to be able to come back home during Thanksgiving. I can only imagine how much worse things have gotten since this time. I am hopeful about our future, but at the same time I cannot help but think that the damage we have already done has been enough to destroy the beautiful planet we live on. During this time, I am anxious about our future, with the upcoming election at hand. One of the important lessons I have learned in this class is that personal actions are meaningful and that knowledge is power only if acted upon. During this upcoming election, I am making it a priority to speak up and stress the importance of voting for candidates that support the Green New Deal. I also have made some important personal decisions such as only buying second-hand clothes, decreasing my consumption of meat to only chicken and turkey, and using public transportation more often (if not public transportation, carpooling). Anjaly, I really hope you've continued to be open minded as you age by keeping yourself informed. I know you never want to be a part of another "baby boomer" mentality generation so I hope you continue to promote change and do what is right for our world. Also I hope that if you have decided to have kids (because right now you don't want any), you've kept it at two!

Dear self in 2020:

                   <br><br>


Hey, back to 2020, you are merely 20 years old, a freshman who came to U.S as an international student without any cognition on the climate change.

                   <br><br>


Thanks to the requirements made by the U.S general education! To fulfill the area G, you made a really brilliant decision to attend the Prof.Ken’s class “Climate Crisis 101”, a class made you realize how urgent and impending the climate crisis was and paved the way for your future change for the living style ! Initially, you did not take serious about the class and were reluctant to pay much attention on it due to the fact that a GE class was irrelevant to the Mathematics major. However, with the films, readings and lectures, the climate crisis gradually played a predominant part in your life. You began to realize how shallow you were on the comprehension of the climate crisis before —— climate change did not merely stand for the rise of the sea level, it also represented the homeless of some families, and even lost their lovers due to the destructive causes including hurricanes, earthquakes and etc made by the climate change. Then, these lectures, readings and films gave you a hint on how urgent the climate crisis was and motivated you to make some change immediately.


                   <br><br>

The film “Minimalism” was essential for your later life. Before watching the documentary “Minimalism”, you were firmly believe that the material items were the priority in your life. Fulfilling the material wants would enable you to obtain the maximum satisfaction. Nevertheless, that documentary enabled you to realize too many material items would accumulate the vacancy rather than satisfaction. It was true that obtaining an object that you were longing for would make you happy. But the happiness would not last too long. Once the novelty disappeared, the happiness would vanish as well. Then, you decided to change the way you consume. Instead of paying attention to the appearance, you began to focus on the functionalism of the item. Rather than buying countless clothes, you began to your lust for new items. And now, after 40 years, you have already learnt how to use the limited items to match different styles.

                   <br><br>


You realized how essential to change meat-based diet to plant-based diet. Meanwhile, you also realized it was difficult to suddenly change your used eating habit. Therefore, a palatable solution came into your mind—gradually change rather than suddenly change. You started to reduce the ingesting of meat and increase the consumption of vegetable. And now, you successfully become a healthy vegetarian. 

                   <br><br>


All of your class realized your generation was responsible and had to make change to save the earth, or the next generation definitely would encounter the horrible nightmares. Thus, the your classmates in the class made similar changes like you. And your changes triggered the curiosity of others around you, which gave you an opportunity to explain your purpose for those changes and advocated others to join those changes.


                   <br><br>

Luckily, due to the cooperation, you, the younger generation, successfully controlled the increase of temperature within 2 degrees celsius and now, the next generation are used to the newly change life style!

To think in 40 years I'll be 60…. It seems weird writing to my future self especially when I have no idea what will be of this earth then. That’s crazy to even think about, that everything could be so different compared to what it is right now. But I’m not writing this letter as a glimpse into the 20 something year old Alyssa’s dramatic life, but this letter is to look back on how freaking insane our economic, social, cultural, and specifically scientific standings were. I really hope things have changed, even a little bit would be better than it is right now. Don’t get me wrong 2020 is an amazing year to be alive so far but with the good comes the bad, in this case the horrible. Being an environmental studies major in 2020 is so damn annoying and let me remind you why. In case you forgot this was the time when climate change really was turning heads but yet no one really wanted to do anything major to fix it. There were so many activists, so many proposed policies, many offered solutions, but also many climate deniers. If people are still denying climate change in 2060, then i’m going to feel like a huge disappointment. Specifically when I’m focusing so much of my life on issues related to the environment, there better be some change happening real soon. I’m in the class climate crisis 101 currently, I don’t know if you really remember much about it but while it’s also really depressing at times it can also inspire hope. There are about 900 people in this class and that means that all these people care at least a little bit about the environment. If each of these 900 people went and talked to at least 1 person about the impending doom our environment will face if we don’t take action, then we can get more people involved in this movement.  I really am hoping that my generation takes action soon and eventually the future generations follow suit. 
                     <br><br>
 I’m writing this to my future self for a few reasons but mainly I just wanted to remind myself how truly chaotic these past few years have been. The fact that climate change is a political issue and that people can be on different sides of it baffles me. So being the liberal I am, I hope that the democratic party took back the house eventually and made some serious changes. Such as rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, refusing to back big oil, making the switch to renewables, and most importantly implementing the Green New Deal. You were such a fan so you better have done everything in your power to make it happen like portesting, voting for the candidates who supported it, and getting involved in collective activism. There is a group I’m considering joining on campus called EcoVista…. So I wonder if I will eventually? I can’t help but be a little worried about the future.
                   <br><br>
   Alright this is what I’m hoping the future will look…. As a human race we all joined together and pressured our governments into installing 100% renewable energy and that means solar, geothermal, and wind turbines. I never personally liked the idea of nuclear, it always just seemed so dangerous. I’m also hoping that the majority of the planet turned to a plant based diet or at least vegetarians so that deforestation can come to a halt. That’s always been something that’s bothered me because we’ve actually been destroying precious ecosystems in order to make room for cattle who only feed a small percentage of the population. While cattle also use our land, they also are eating food that can feed the starving and food insecure. There is just so much wrong and all of it adds in to create a terrible problem. I hope things have turned around in your time, that things are better, that you’re not scared anymore.

Message from the future:
                   <br><br>
It is now the year 2060 and a lot has changed. 40 years ago it was 2020 and this was a crucial year. This was the year of chaos and mayhem. The climate crisis was a huge concern and the coronavirus pandemic was just beginning. As the coronavirus continued to spread, everything became canceled and the economy saw a recession. The virus got out of hand and the lower class experienced the most deaths. Eventually, a cure was found, but at that point, the Earth's population had decreased by 25%. Although this was a tragic pandemic, the decrease in population helped with the climate crisis. After many years of rebuilding, the Earth was able to recover and utilize resources more efficiently.  
                   <br><br>
By 2030, the United States had a political party dedicated to resolving the climate crisis. They were able to implement environmental programs and pass a feasible carbon tax. This tax lead to a shift in transportation modes. Many people in my generation started to ride bikes and take public buses, which drastically reduced our carbon footprints. Additionally, the materialistic views began to fade and fewer people stopped worrying about excessiveness. The living standards have also changed, as more people are living in small houses that are mostly solar-powered. 
                   <br><br>
The use of fossil fuels is non-existent now in 2060 and we safely living on Earth.  As our population continues to rise, we must continue to live carbon-free lifestyles if we want future generations to live on Earth as well. Another major contribution to the saving of our Earth was Kenneth Hiltner's class. This class was the first time I really learned about the climate crisis and the impact it had on our Earth. I was surprised and alarmed, but then realized we need to take action. By the year 2025 Kenneth Hiltner's youtube videos had blown up and every American was aware of the crisis. We were able to collectively come up resolutions and now we are still thriving in 2060. 
                   <br><br>
Sincerely,  CG

It is now the year 2060. It really all started in high school. I was part of a wonderful organization called Youth Action which stemmed from Communities for a Better Environment (CBE). These organizations helped me realize how my community of Huntington Park was victim of environmental racism. It angered me to have to wake up to the smell of dead pigs thanks to Farmer Johns and the fumes of the many factories from our neighboring city Vernon. With major freeways around us too and a history of one them collapsing impacting the health of our community I was angry. Thanks to those organizations I tried to be as involved as I could before I left to college. I joined Tree People and every other weekend we planted and cared for trees all over the city. However, when it was time for me to leave to college at UCSB I thought what now? How am I contributing to help the environment? Well one of my friends told me to take a class called English 22 my freshman year, and little did I know the impact that class would have on me. After taking English 22, I became a climatarian which many people thought was so dumb. From consuming so much meat and being a consumer in general, I started to realize that I don’t need new clothes every week and I shouldn’t be eating this much meat. I transitioned to a largely plant based diet (which after the year 2020 many people did too). I loved that class and the readings it included. I recommended this class to everyone! Then the professor Ken Hiltner made another class to follow up English 22 called the Climate Crisis 101. As yall probably know the year 2020 was when Bernie won the election. It felt as though the timing of taking the class and Bernie winning in the same year was fate. Bernie made sure to implement so many changes like the iconic Green New Deal. From there we went from cars to bike paths and slow travel. Hardly anyone had a car by 2030. Now, no one misses them and its although we have forgotten about them because of the harm it had caused for so many years. Everyone had a fair job, and the Green New Deal made sure no one was left behind while we went through major transitions. The culture idea of bigger is better is finally gone. We were able to help rewrite the way society works here in the US and many other first world nations followed. Everyone stopped intervening in third world countries for selfish reasons like maldevelopment. Everyone now has access to food and water, housing, healthcare, higher education, etc.Consumer culture is gone. The fast fashion industry was exposed widely after 2020 and no one was willing to be part of that anymore. 
                   <br><br>
Im proud to say that it was my generation who was pushed for this change to happen. Constant activism, community, and voting got us all here.

To whoever finds this letter one day, I hope it reaches you in better health.
                   <br><br>

I remember taking a class on the climate crisis my freshman year of college- my only year I would be attending college. My classmates and professor seemed so full of hope. No one has that anymore. In that class we read an article by David Wallace-Wells called "The Uninhabitable Earth". He was a pessimistic journalist who expected the world to wither away if drastic action wasn't taken now. We both didn't expect any major action to be taken soon enough. We were right. 
                   <br><br>

My second quarter at UCSB was the awakening of the world. Disaster after disaster occurred. They didn't stop. People realized something was wrong. They went to religion for answers. They thought it was the end of the world. People wondered why this was all happening. The answers were all in front of us. We needed to stop burning fossil fuels now. Despite what was happening, there were no necessary changes put forth. That quarter, fires burned through Australia and the rest of the world. Animals went extinct. The Amazon burned. But most importantly, the Coronavirus started a global Pandemic. 
                   <br><br>

This was the beginning of the 6th extinction. 
                   <br><br>

In David Wallace-Well's article, he mentioned that diseases unknown to humanity hidden in the partially frozen permafrost would melt and wreak havoc on the world. I thought I would never see something like that in my lifetime. Little did I know it happened underneath my nose. 
                   <br><br>

The coronavirus spread rapidly across the whole world. Never in my lifetime had I seen the world shut down so fast. Air travel was restricted. Grocery stores, restaurants, and schools all closed. People fought over water, rice, toilet paper. I remember feeling so unconvinced because I had to leave UCSB for a quarter. I was so privileged. I went back home that quarter. Little did I know I wouldn't come back. 
                   <br><br>

I thought that the coronavirus would fade away as quickly as it started. But it was just the beginning. Everyday, the corona virus got exponentially worse. It just started off with a few people! A few weeks after I got home, 1/3 of my city's population had gotten it before there was a vaccine. 
                   <br><br>

But the vaccine was expensive, many couldn't afford it after being stuck at home out of a job for months. People didn't take it. It continued to spread. Eventually, some billionaire post-sex-scandal bought the patent and distributed the vaccine to the public. 
                   <br><br>

I wish it all ended there. The coronavirus wasn't the only thing tearing the world apart. Food supplies dropped after the death of so many laborers. The stock market plunged. It seemed like everyone was in a panic. President Biden was incompetent, always half-assing social programs and policies. He was not the extreme leader we needed during these extreme times. With high tensions between all, many civil wars broke out over the world. Combined with the worldwide famine, about a billion died. 
                   <br><br>

Diseases kept coming. I thought corona was bad. These diseases were fatal. No scientist could fathom a vaccine to such an unknown illness. The best you could do was hide. 
                   <br><br>

Crime rate grew exponentially. Forget owning business. It would have guaranteed been robbed, killing you in the process. Your best bet was to grow everything you needed in a farm. So that's what I did. I moved far away into the San Bernardino Mountains. I built an underground home powered by solar and grew what I needed. 
                   <br><br>

Growing food was difficult. Temperatures were rising. Fires were eating away at the land. The air quality plummeted. Water was never clean. Corporations tried making us buy our way out of these problems. It never worked. 
                   <br><br>

To this day I don't know how I survived this long. I don't think I'll be around for much longer. I dodged every deadly disease and luckily my country was financially stable to help with some problems. 
                   <br><br>

I remember government. I was a political science major for the two quarter I was at UCSB! Government officials were highly protected, but you can't stop a deadly disease. I remember when our congresspeople started dropping like flies. Too many to be replaced. People were in hiding. No one was reporting anything anymore. There was only one goal: survive.

Hey there.                    <br><br>

What a life. How the World has changed since you were in college. When you were a freshman, you took English 23 or a more easy way to remember the name was Climate Crisis 101. I remember  you took that class because  you kinda just wanted the GE credits. I also remember  how unaware you were of the climate situation back then. You had no idea how bad the problem was. I am curious f you would have done anything about it if you didn't take that class. Well regardless, you did make a change and Im proud of you. 
                   <br><br>


The amount of waste and overproduction, consumerism, large greedy corporations, and so much more. It is crazy to know that you were handed all of this. You dealt with bad politicians and choices. You had to battle large corporations. An d you had to battle yourself.The good thing is, you took this class. You learned about the problems. You were given the tools to make a change. you saw the problem and were blown away. Instead of running away however, you stuck with it and made the change. I remember  when you decided to become an environmental studies major. It was not always easy to make changes but you took it on and didn't stray away or just let someone else figure it out.
                   <br><br>


The first change you could make was yourself. I remember  how much extra clothes and so much stuff you continued to buy even when you didn't need it. I remember  how you liked to drive everywhere even when it wasn't that far away. I remember  all of the unhealthy habit you had that affected the environment. But I also remember the changes you made. I remember  when you decided to stop buying so much tuff and only got what you needed. I know how you decided to bike everywhere and stop driving as much when you didnt need to. I also remember  how you made it through the whole Coronovirus scare. I know how scared you were and how the feeling of the unknown took over your thoughts. But we both know who got you through it. Have trust. You made it through and prospered. Large corporations finally made the change and did their part to help the environment.
                   <br><br>


I am proud of you for make the change and not giving up. Keep up the good work and protect our planet.

I recognize that my perspective would lean towards the optimistic/naive end of the spectrum, but I don’t think it hurts to hope for more so that the end result is still pretty damn good. By pretty damn good, I’m talking about a world where climatarian diets were a way of life, whether it’s the stock of grocery stores or menu at restaurants (other than just “seasonal fruit”). Our entire system would promote diversity in every way, whether it’s diversity in people’s backgrounds, to the produce grown in different climates, to the materials used to build homes and other infrastructure. Food would be produced AND DISTRIBUTED “more efficiently” in that less of it would be designated to the landfill before it even makes it to the market. Each community would have a permaculture design of growing food in their gardens, promoting the uniqueness of each community and relieving any one or few places of the responsibility of mass-producing and shipping products to places far away. Oftentimes, these big factories and farms have unpleasant working conditions that tend to affect poorer individuals and communities, giving them labor that keeps them stuck in the same unjust cycle of pain and suffering. They say that happiness is contagious. If this is true, the opposite is very likely to also be true. Thus, this sadness seeps into the rest of society, subtly back into the empty-heartedly produced meat eaten by those who can afford it, and obviously back into the workers’ souls, families and friends. 
                   <br><br>

It may seem like I am throwing out different topics, BUT EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED. The idea of a “plenitude economy” really adopts this idea. Treating our workers better by having less work days will make everything else better, even though it would seem counterintuitive on the surface. We would be quick to think that the more you work, the more you’ll get done… But how many of us are already so familiar with the idea of working smarter instead of harder? I think if you apply this idea to the principles of a plenitude economy, it becomes much easier to understand how it would work for the better. And so, I really hope that we would have adopted this idea 40 years from now. With less work days, we would have more time for other just as important parts of life, like spending time with people and (the fun kind of) travelling. They’d also have more time to consider more sustainable alternatives to their everyday life, like using clotheslines, cooking in groups, growing their own food, secondhand shopping, biking or taking public transportation, building/repairing their belongings, and building relationships with people that would naturally make communal items more likely to exist. With this one systematic change, so much else could change. I dream of what other systematic changes could do the same… 
                   <br><br>

Changing our government would change so much. It isn’t all on the voters, but voting does help quite a bit. With the “right” politicians who will push for action in favor of the planet and the people on it, change can sweep our issues away. For-profit companies and corporations would especially be regulated enough so that communities wouldn’t be incapacitated from growing independent. Our world would move to the natural kind of green--plants, nature, and all the wonderful things they entail--and away from the superficial kind: money. I am definitely not talking about greenwashing either; I’m talking about the genuine, healthy green.  I hope that the planet will be much greener--so much so that you could see it if you were in space taking a picture of the earth--and not bluer… Not bluer from the oceans rising and flooding land NOR bluer from the increase of technology as “solutions”. I want a naturally green world.

It is the year 2060. In 1970, a New York Time's article predicted that "Man's Activities [Would Rule] Climate by 2000" - the same year I was destined to be born, and I can tell you now, that everything that the two scientists who were interviewed for the article said turned out to be true. I grew up in a time where technology was flourishing, and there were no limits to how far we would go with it, so we went the furthest we could. We knew it was bad, but we did not care - not until it was almost too late.
                   <br><br>
I was brought up being told that it was important to take small measures to ensure our planet stayed habitable, and I always did everything I could, but I never fully understood how catastrophic the the effects climate change could be... until 2020. That was when I enrolled in a class simply to fulfill some general education requirements, and I was able to actually study ways human activities were negatively affecting our planet, and how we had the power to bring about change. I was also lucky to grow up in a time where American politics seemed to be undergoing a revolution. Young voters were learning how much elections affected their futures and we were becoming vocal.
                   <br><br>
2020 was an important year - we were insanely close to electing the revolutionary leader Bernie Sanders. I was heavily involved in trying to elect him. Unfortunately, people were too afraid to have a leader who would potentially change the stereotypical American democracy, and instead bring forth a form of democratic socialism, so Joe Biden was elected, who was better than incumbent President Trump, but not enough. Working with other leaders, he was able to implement a decent amount of laws regarding the environment, and put the United States back into the Paris Agreement. However, many people thought that there was so much more we could have been doing. In 2022, the Democrats took control of the Senate once again, and the same year, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announced her campaign for the 2024 presidential election. Just like I did for Bernie 4 years before this, I volunteered to help elect her. It seemed impossible for her to get far, but she won the nomination, and went on to defeat the Republican nominee, becoming the first woman, and youngest president ever elected. Moreover, more progressive Democrats began to gain power throughout the nation. Democrats still controlled the House and Senate, so AOC spent her first hundred days getting important laws passed, including the Green New Deal, and the United States gradually began to shift to cleaner alternatives. Many people lost their jobs and financial stability, and the first two years were rough, but by the end of her first term, things had settled down, the economy was doing great, and she was reelected in 2028.
                   <br><br>
The twelve year period between 2020 and 2032 was the most important era of my life, and it alone determined whether the US would do the right thing, or continue to favor the wealthy and powerful over the larger middle-class population. I'm lucky enough to say that, in the end, we did do the right thing. We transitioned to clean energy, put a ban on fracking, reduced the amount of beef we ate, reduced the number of flights we took, reduced plastic and food waste, popularized public transportation by making it more punctual and accessible, and utilized the same technology that was destroying us to make us better. We also helped poorer countries transition to environmentally friendly ways.
                   <br><br>
Unfortunately, not everything went perfectly. Many coastal cities went underwater, and a great number of environmental refugees were created, many crops were destroyed, and extreme weather was still hitting many areas around the world. Luckily, many countries, including ours, volunteered in many ways to help the suffering people. It took us almost two decades before we got to where we wanted to be, but we did it. Soon, coral reefs began to come back to life, temperatures stopped rising, and forests have been restored, many species are no longer endangered, and the air in what were some of the most polluted cities is confirmed to have improved drastically.
                   <br><br>
Of course, young people today probably don't realize the how life-changing and risky the transition was because you never lived through it, but to my generation, the one who grew up to see the "before versus after", it was the greatest movement we ever witnessed. When the phrase "we must learn from history in order to avoid repeating it" is said, it is often in reference to wars or economic disasters, but know that the climate crisis was the worst thing that could have happened to the human population, and it is important that we refrain from repeating that too. The fight against climate change was significant because it taught us the power of having certain knowledge, and having the courage to use that knowledge to fight for change. So, to the young folks out there, I say keep on fighting the good fight, don't let history repeat itself, and treat your planet with love always.

Hi, to me in 40 years later:

                   <br><br>

How are you? Are you live in a powerful and peaceful country? How are my dear families? I hope that you are good and other family members are still happy without any bad things. 
                   <br><br>
It is me from 40 years ago and you must surprise why I write down these words to you. I want to remind you something about 40 years ago. I just want you to have an image of me now and what is the environment looks like now. I don’t know how is environment 40 years later. Can nature and humans coexist harmoniously? Do you have floods, earthquakes, or many wildfires caused by humans?
                   <br><br>
Now, please let me give you what is life now in 2020. I am an undergraduate student who chose to take Professor Ken’s course related to the climate crisis. Through the 3 month’s learning, I have a basic understanding of the human impact on environmental change. Fossils fuels, fracking, fast fashions, factories which contaminant local environments, wastes of food, car driving, and overconsumption on beef, etc. all bring huge devastation to our planet’s largest endurances. Professor Ken also instructs us on how to act in order to avoid further devastation. Daily and easy actions like riding a bike, voting to good candidates, slow transportations, plant-based diets, and co-apartments are all plausible solutions to the climate crisis. 
                   <br><br>
I am deeply influenced by it but the point it although many students have learned the course related to the climate crisis. Will they including me have persistent and encouraging willingness to make a change for a life-long time. Though there are many students who did feel shocked by the climate crisis, it’s hard to insist on making a daily change. I don’t know if there is a difference between the old generations and new generations. I believe you must know the answer because you’re the person living in the future and the outside environment proves whether people including me have ever made a change 40 years ago. 
                   <br><br>
To be honest, there have been alarms sent by nature to humans. Floods, melting icebergs, rising sea levels, wildfires, extreme climates, pest damage to crops and many other horrible disasters to the human world. It is not a good year in 2020, at least, in the first few months. Worldwide epidemic--coronavirus-- damaged millions of people’s lives. 
                   <br><br>
In fact, attitudes and actions now determine what future people’s lives will be. I hope that your reply will tell me that you live well and people in my generation have made a huge, consistent change. Then, I will feel happy and more inner-motivated to act. I will still try my best to make a change and hope to see a good result in 40 years later. 

                   <br><br>

Warmly,
                   <br><br>
Me in the past



</p><hr>


<p>
TO myself:                   <br><br>

The first thing that you have done it quickly is to reduce your Co2 emission. This task is not only required you to use public transport also required you to eat less beef and more vegetable. It seems ridiculous before you take ENGL 23 at UCSB. However, I am here to tell you that the environment of earth millions of years ago is 10 times worse than current, and yet the earth survived and all lives are dead. This task is not about how to save the earth, it is about how you save yourself. The human race doesn’t have the ability to save the earth because we couldn’t undo what we have done. The task is quite like what Frodo has, if you failed, or if the human race failed, there could be no survivors. 
                   <br><br>

I believe that what I am writing to you still made you feeling confused. But I must tell you more. The beginning of the 21st century is an era that people are all improving their living standards, which means a lot of things are wasted. You have to reduce your time on shopping. It does not mean that you have to live like Gandhi but you must reduce your desire for consuming things which you don’t need. Spend more time on reading books, playing the violin and any other things that could increase your happiness in your daily life. Try to think about this climate crisis like philosophy, and try to think about new ideas about how to reduce your greenhouse gas emission. 
                   <br><br>

The climate crisis is not about yourself but everyone living beside you. You should tell them about how to save themselves in this crisis. Imagine that if our generation failed our task at your age and brought extinction on this beautiful earth and you had to spend the rest of your life living under the cover of constructions which like nuclear bunkers. That is what will happen if you failed. Cherish your life, cherish the beautiful earth, and tried to save yourself in this climate crisis.

<p>
To my future,
                   <br><br>


It is the year 2020 and the world seems to be spiraling into complete chaos. We are barely in the third month of the year and we have already come close to WWIII, our planet was on fire for the longest, and we are currently experiencing a world pandemic. There is not much to look forward to. If we recover from our current situation, it seems like we will just be hit by something harder. People are not taking precautions and are living their lives as stupid without any regard for the world or others. I know I sound pessimistic but that is the reality I see right now. I do hope we are able to recover quickly, but the aftermath will be harder to recover from. I believe the economic crisis will devastate many of us, especially those who come from a lower class.

                   <br><br>

I have a message that I hope I am able to read in the far future. I hope we were able to overcome this pandemic without losing that may people, I hope the wars that are currently happening in the middles east end, I hope climate change is no longer an issue for the future. I genuinely hope people change. Cause if none f these things change I am afraid I am just writing to a ghost. I am afraid that I will not be able to read this in a couple of years.

                   <br><br>


Future me, I hope you were wrong about all of the pessimistic thoughts you had. I hope I can laugh about this in the future.

Hello, younger me,  you handsome son of a gun,

                   <br><br>

I’m you from the future, 2060 to be exact. I’m not going to lie, you haven't aged a bit, you're going to be pleased. I’m here to deliver some news, and hopefully, communicate some potentially life-saving information. You’re looking at some rough times ahead kid. The administration is quite useless, to be honest. They have without a fail managed to make climate change a priority until it was simply too late to do anything if we wanted to. The planet is in shambles.
                   <br><br>


It all started with the storms. Terrible terrible storms resulting from changing temperatures and wind currents. Soon after came the flooding. I think it became real to America when most of Florida went under, regardless of what they were hearing on the news. Typical. Then the oil ran out and that's when all h*ll broke loose. Fighting broke out among nations to secure what precious little oil reserves were left in the world, and we came to refer to this war as The Last World War. There wasn’t going to be another. There would be nothing left to fight over.  Entire nations were, and are, getting wiped out. Human rights have become non-existent and we have been established as a military regime to preserve the “order.” So I am writing this letter asking for your help. Not just to help myself, but the planet as a whole.

                   <br><br>

I cannot begin to stress enough how important it is that you should remain steadfast in your dreams of becoming a lawyer/activist. I truly believe you can do what I could not do if you have the information I crucially needed in my time. To start, the government has failed us. Time and time again, they have failed to implement the changes we so desperately needed due to the tight grip of interest groups, and despite my best efforts, I was not able to successfully campaign for emergency efforts to minimize human-induced climate change. Three of my top concerns I attempted to tackle, unfortunately rather unsuccessfully, were food waste, cattle/meat consumption, and refrigerant disposal. ⅓ of food produced/made never even makes it to the dinner table. Raising livestock for meat is responsible for 51% of carbon emissions. The key to this is to encourage minimizing waste, and donating excess to places where they could be put to use, such as shelters or food drives. On top of this, normalize the adoption of a plant-based diet. Though admittedly this will be a difficult task, I know with the right exposure, you can make a sizable impact in the sales of the meat industry. On top of that, many fail to realize the damage improper refrigerant disposal can have on the environment. CFCs and HFCs are released into the ozone with a 1000-9000 higher capacity to warm the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. It was listed by the 25 summaries by Project Drawdown as one of the primary solutions for climate change. With this in mind, I believe you could devise a clever enough strategy to become a significant political threat to climate change disbelieving politicians. Had I known all this at the time, I could have devised a more concrete case in the fight against climate change, but it’s for that reason I’m passing this knowledge onto you.

                   <br><br>

One thing before I leave. Enjoy life. You’re about to have the best couple years of your life, make the most out of them. It gets tough from here, law school ain’t easy. But almost remember what you’re fighting for, to ensure a world where people don’t have to needlessly die because of the greed of political and corporate leaders. Persevere, remember what you’re there for, and I promise you’ll be just fine. You’re going to make a fine man, maybe even become the president one day. I wish you the best kiddo, good luck.


All the best                   <br><br>

Old You

A message to the future:
                    <br><br>

To whoever is reading this,
                    <br><br>

It has been a long struggle, but we’re here, and thriving globally. Before describing how we succeeded, I would like to bring up how we were failing ourselves- and our future generation 40 years ago.
                    <br><br>

In the year 2020, we were at the highest rates of global carbon emissions historically, and there were no efforts or even thoughts to lower our carbon emissions. Our earth and its inhabitants were affected in many ways. A few include: temperatures rising, wildfires occurring more, sea levels rising- these were all human caused. A few explicit human impacts included destroying habitats, destroying rainforests, environmental racism. All of these were done in the name of profit and economic growth. Those most affected were poor people and animals- those who have no access to capital. They were reduced and commodified as a pawn in corporate interest. It is no coincidence that those groups were affected; they did not have the money that corporations and capitalist governments did. And these groups took advantage of that. We saw this in the United States- the Dakota Access Pipeline in Standing Rock, Flint Michigan, and the Santa Barbara oil spill. Capitalist interest either enabled the government to cause the problem or stop them from addressing the problem. We also saw this globally- the destruction of the Brazilian Amazonia for beef, sweatshop exploitation in developing nations for mass production of material goods, and the murders of environmental activists. The climate crisis is one that has overlapping facets and is one of many global issues. However, I focus on the climate crisis not because it is an issue greater than others, such as racism, exploitation of the nation states, and so on. I focus on this specific issue because I wanted to show how all issues overlap and how addressing the climate crisis cannot be done without addressing other global issues and vice versa. We did see victories but we also saw failures. We saw many lives lost, habitats destroyed, species gone extinct- irreversible damage. But one thing we still clung on to was hope. And with that hope, we were able to mitigate the climate crisis before it was irreversible on a global level.
                   <br><br>

It is 2060 and we did it. Capitalism collapsed with the best efforts of the collective people. However, its collapse was inevitable; unlike our earth, capitalism is not made to be sustainable. It is an entity that works in whatever way it can to maximize profit and own means of production- through emitting carbon into the atmosphere, exploiting laborers, polluting the land, and so on. A lot has drastically changed without capitalism as a global practice and with its deterioration in most nations. Political change was attained on a national, then a global level due to the collapse of capitalism in the imperial core. Nonetheless, we are thankful that this transition was swift and not met with extreme resistance. In 2020, we saw a trend of an increase in class consciousness, more than we did in prior years. This is because of the increase in social stratification, which led to class consciousness. We were able to see who our true enemy was- it wasn’t each other but capitalists who owned every facet of our lives- out labor, our time, our humanity- and it spread like wildfire. 
                   <br><br>

We had a progressive president elected in the US in 2020. Many sweeping policy changes were made. However, this required a lot of grassroots collective action for it to be accepted by most in the nation. The masses are the ones with the true power, not the few who own the means of production and power. People have become increasingly poorer; you could no longer afford basic housing, healthcare, or even eat properly. We therefore saw a massive increase in leftist ideology; socialism was not scary nor a threat to our existence as we have grown up learning. We had a massive left push. There was a further push to the left after the election of the progressive president, but this was just the beginning. We demanded more, and more progressive policy was made; outsourcing in any other country out of the United States for capitalist interest became outlawed, corporations could no longer emit more than a certain amount of pollution or greenhouse gases to the earth, mass private land ownership was restricted and then outlawed, and education, healthcare, basic living necessities, and things for us to thrive as a species became universal. These are just a few of the many changes we have seen in the last 40 years. It was difficult because of strong pushback from those with power, the 1%. However, there was enough class consciousness which led to change. The country no longer served the interest of the 1% and as a result, the 1% disappeared. This did not occur solely because of our president, but because of the perseverance those who organized. This political change in the U.S. led to individual behavioral change. We no longer were subjected to a culture of capitalism; we were no longer alienated from the perils of capitalism. In addition, very few people use cars now, we do not consume as many material products anymore, we eat very little meat, we upcycle and reuse our items, and we are more collective. We are happy and content.
                   <br><br>

The demise of capitalism in the imperial core- the United States, led to global change. Many nations became and are becoming socialist, but not following the framework of Nordic socialist nations. Instead, closer to socialist nations in the global south and the east.  These nations do not exploit the labor of once poorer nations, as Nordic countries did. They live off the land and take care of it back. They do not act by exploiting- they act by the consensus of the masses.  
                   <br><br>

As I am writing this, I am sitting under a tree in the Southeast LA area, where there was once enormous acts of environmental racism. We are in the process of decolonizing and making reparations towards those the US has hurt for generations. I take a deep breath and all I smell is the roses; all I hear is gusty winds and birds chirping. I am proud of my generation and I know that this current generation will not let us down. We have made tremendous changes in these past 40 years and it seems that we are only making more progress from here. However, we should not stop now; we should continue working, organizing, and becoming more conscious not only for ourselves, but our siblings all over this planet. There is still work that needs to be done, and that should not be discouraging, because constant progress only means that we are not stagnant- we can only get better and become better people from here. So I ask this generation just one thing- please don’t stop. There is always something that can be done to better the material conditions of ourselves and others. Do not lose that drive that led us to this beautiful and thriving planet that we inhabit now, in 2040, a year I did not think I would see.
                    <br><br>
“Only an organized and conscious people can bring about a different kind of society”

<p>
I recently read a book called Jailbird by Kurt Vonnegut. He repeatedly wrote "nature sympathized" to illustrate how the weather was reacting to events in the book. For example, when a man was locked up in jail, it started to rain, and Vonnegut wrote "nature sympathized." This line has stuck with me in simple ways as I watch the world around me but it also led to a larger conclusion for me. I had viewed the climate crisis as the problem, the thing to tackle, but what I realize now is that the climate crisis is only one symptom of the larger issue of imbalance. We consume more than we need and we tip over into dissatisfaction and loneliness. We waste about a third of our food in the U.S. while people go hungry. Some people benefit from such wealth because of fossil fuel use and live ridiculous, excessive lifestyles while many others exist without adequate resources. All of these things represent imbalance. I am constantly amazed by how interconnected all of the problems and solutions of climate change are. Compost to decrease waste and wow also improve agriculture. Educate women to decrease the amount of unwanted pregnancies but also just because we should. Many of the solutions to climate change are really things we should be doing anyway. Why consume less? Well, yes the climate suffers when we consume more than we need but also it turns out we'll be happier when we consume out of necessity and focus more energy on relationships and personal health. 
                    <br><br>

Anyway, "nature sympathized," it lead me to believe that nature is reacting to the imbalance on earth. Sure, scientifically, the imbalance is altering the climate, but also, symbolically, nature is so sad to witness such selfishness and ignorance of others that it sympathizes through increasingly intense weather events. If you'd rather not personify nature, leave it, but it has been an interesting alternate way to view the problem for me and it has lead me to truly understand that the climate crisis is a reaction to a myriad of problems. To view it as the single problem and to ignore the larger picture would be to neglect the root causes.  I don't think we can fix this without great social and political change. Even if we had some magic technology that could suck CO2 out of the atmosphere, we would still live in an unbalanced world. The climate crisis is an opportunity to fix things. We can not continue living as we do now and the shift will be difficult but I think we will all be happier and the world will be better balanced after. 
                    <br><br>

Looking back from 2060, I remember the most important first step: caring about each other. It took a while but once enough people had personally experienced the effects of climate change, we generally became more empathetic. Disaster strengthened communities and we sympathized  with others experiencing hardships once we ourselves had. This newfound tendency toward empathy was evident on both small and large scales. People thought less about themselves and more than ever about other people. This newfound true investment in the well being of other people helped us form connections. Connections led to comfort and we let ourselves rely on each other. We stopped existing so independently. We thought independence was the ideal but we found out we were happier when we needed one another. We shared time and energy and things we couldn't do alone became easy with the help of others. We shared gardens and food, clothing and living spaces. We found that we had so much fun talking with and caring for one another that we weren't so intrigued by material goods as we once were, so we bought much less. We thrift shopped together because it was fun and we could find cool things. We biked and it made us healthier and happier to be in the open air while we traveled. This investment in the well being of others extended to people we didn't know. Because we cared about our neighbors, friends, and family so much, we also found that we cared for people in different cities and countries because they had neighbors, friends, and family too. So we became more politically active. Less consumed by stress and time constraints, we didn't feel limited in our ability to stand  up for other people. We reacted to injustice rather than just watching it. We protested, we voted, and we focused more than ever on local politics. We found out how powerful it can feel to make a change and how possible it is on local levels. People started living more consciously on personal levels and the government responded to demands by the people to tax carbon and force the switch to renewables. Like the people in communities began relying on each other, countries did too. All countries couldn't make this switch alone, some of them needed help. We saw the climate crisis as a world problem that affected us all so we were generous with resources to help developing countries make the switch to renewables as well. We did it. We stopped the climate crisis and we are letting the planet heal from the damage we caused. It turned out that the secret to all of it was caring about other people, sympathizing as intensely as nature does.

Dear Future Self, 
                    <br><br>


I'm setting this message to send in the year 2060. Let's go back to your past. 2020 was a revolutionary year not only for the planet, but for you. In 2020, you were a freshman at UC Santa Barbara. Prior to your studies at the university, you didn't know much about Climate Change nor were you really aware of the crisis that we were in. You signed up for a course titled "The Climate Crisis" without putting much thought into it. That course really ended up changing your views on the climate and made you realize how much danger our planet is really in. Being someone who has a deep love for nature, you were devastated at that realization. That class brought the crisis into the light. You really developed an interest to figure out what was at the root of the Climate Crisis and what you could do to stop it. The conclusion you came to? The Climate Crisis was brought about in a single lifetime, and is human caused. 

                    <br><br>


With this information, I hope you acted accordingly. You were passionate and aware about what you could do to save the environment, tried to support people who would support the environment. I hope your actions will line up with your values. They must. Do you recall reading a book in that class titled Walden? This was a book that really caught your eye. One of the primary contributing factors to the Climate Crisis is the consumption based, materialistic, wasteful lifestyle that you and many Americans were guilty of. When you read this book in college, you wanted to adopt a minimalist lifestyle in order to better the environment. The book Walden, if you recall, showed you a prime example of how to live a minimalist lifestyle and its benefits. It showed how one can gain personal freedom, financial independence, and a bond with nature all while  benefiting and saving the environment. Hopefully you took note.

                    <br><br>

I truly hope that learning about the climate has inspired you to action. I hope that you are living a lifestyle that is symbiotic to the planet rather that destructive. If you are living an environmentally destructive lifestyle, please remember what you learned and realize what your actions are doing. I don't think this is the case. It would be hard to see any version of you harming the environment as you love nature. 2020 was the year in which your climate journey began. I can foresee positive things for the planet in 2060 if things go as planned. 

                    <br><br>

I am writing this for one primary reason: to remind you of the urgency of the situation and to remind you of what you have learned. There are a few possible scenarios for which you may find yourself in when receiving this message. Either the Climate Crisis has gotten out of control and worsened, or the Climate Crisis was shut down by environmentalists who passed Eco friendly legislation that changed attitudes of people while saving the planet. Hopefully the case is the latter. If the situation has gotten worse, I hope this letter serves to inspire you and remind you how far you've come. It isn't too late, there is more you can do. If you are living a minimalist lifestyle, I am proud of you. Continue doing what you are doing. If Climate Crisis has gotten substantially better, don't forget where you've come from and never forget how easily it would be for the planet to be at danger again.  With this in mind, I hope you continue caring for the environment and continue to hold what you learned dear. Do not forget what you have learned because it is vital to saving the planet.

Dear future self: To save the world you have one mission reduce your carbon emission. This means that you really have to make changes that you'd probably wouldn't want to.  Changes such as eating less meat or driving less. You also have to hold your government accountable, you cant let them steer the world into its destruction. Its not just your job only though, its everyone around you. Changes will only occur if you encourage the people around you to make one. Be the activist for the climate which cant defend itself. The world provides food, water, air, and shelter for us, but we take it for granted, we leave our trash in the seas, on the streets, and anywhere we please. If you don't take action then nobody in the future will have the opportunity to fix the problem that previous generations created and that we have contributed too.
                    <br><br>
The future will be a bright one and I hope that you dedicate your life to living happily without the needs of material things. In that sense it doesn't mean don't make any money it just means don't spend it and buy things excessively.  Live life like a minimalist, be happy with what you have because if we continue to live he american dream then we will all suffer the consequences as will future generations. Encourage those around you to shop less, and to recycle their things rather than throwing it away and getting a new one. Hopefully we as a society have done something right, but that is for you "my future self" as well as the future society to experience. We won't know till we find out.

If you were to have asked me this question about a week ago, I would have said something very different than what I am about to say. 
                    <br><br>

 As I’m sure we have all heard by now that Coronavirus has wiped through the entire globe. It is kind of hard for me to think about anything else right now because it is affecting our world so drastically. I just drove 2 days back to Colorado and am now sitting in my room writing this, which is something I never could have imagined a week ago. On this note, it is crazy how things can turn your world entirely inside out in a matter of days. I think that what we are all going through right now relates the Climate Crisis in a way because the climate crisis will affect us like the coronavirus is, obviously in different ways, but the panic that has followed. After following many of the stories on the Coronavirus and how the US is responding, I think it is safe to say that in 2060 people didn’t do nearly enough to help combat the climate crisis. Right now, people aren’t doing enough to fight off the Coronavirus in the US and that is hitting us as we speak. I think it is hard for people to see how bad something is until it first hand affects someone they know and love. On that note, here's what I think of for 40 years from now. It's 2060. Much of our population has been wiped off due to the widespread outbreak of the Coronavirus. 40 years ago, I thought the thing that was going to kill us was the impending doom of the climate crisis. Now, there are only 500,000 people still left on this Earth. The virus that wiped us all out, in turn, actually made the climate crisis go away because now we have only a fraction of the amount of people on Earth than we did in 2020. The globe didn't know how to function with that many less people, and there were so many cattle that had no caretarks and the world seemed like it was going down. This is obviously very radical, I am just scared at what to expect right now and can’t get the virus out of my head. 
                    <br><br>

 Now I’m going to talk about what it would be like sans coronavirus. After taking this class with you, I started to use all the things that we learned in class. From not flying, not eating meat, using public transport, and many many more. Along with this, I started to inform people on the impact that cutting these things out has on the environment. As each decade passed, more and more people were becoming increasingly aware of all the actions we can take to combat the climate crisis. Along with this, they were becoming increasingly aware of the effects that it is having on our planet. Each year, the Earth has gotten hotter and hotter and more insane storms have hit not only the US, but all over the World. In 2060, everyone was well aware of the impact that our carbon footprint had on the world and cut it down by a factor of 10. Because we still have a long ways to go before our Earth goes back to how it was, we still have some crazy weather patterns, but it is getting much better. 
                    <br><br>

 But I would say that we need to be more cautious of all the things that we do on an everyday basis. What we eat, what we buy, where we buy, how many kids we have. Everything that we do needs to be thought of before and after in order to combat the climate crisis that we have had in order for it to not happen again. There are many things that can affect us as people, but the climate crisis is one that we have full power over. If we stop the things that are contributing to our carbon footprint, we can halt the climate crisis. The Coronavirus is out of our hands right now, but it should be a little relieving that we do have the climate crisis in our hands if we just step up and take action to fight it.

<p>

Dear future self:
                    <br><br>


I pray that the year 2060 is treating you well and that it is a much better world than it is right now. I don’t really know what to tell you because you know how pessimistic I am. 2020 so far has given me no reason to be optimistic going forward either so that is not a good sign. As you know we are currently going through corona virus and people all over the globe are freaking out which is, in my eyes a positive, because maybe it will show people what can happen when the climate crisis intensified. Ken has mentioned as ice caps melting releases co2, diseases frozen can also be released. Hopefully a scare of another pandemic or just another worldwide disaster starts lighting a fire under the general population to change, but you and I know as soon as crisis passes, people tend to revert back to their old ways. As you obviously know, 2020 is a turning point in saving our environment and I believe politics will favor saving our environment. I hope and think that the democrats will take the senate and have the house, but while I would love the democrats to also take back the white house, at this point I doubt it.

                    <br><br>


As you know, I believe that effective change starts with politics, and I know with democrats being in control of congress, our political system in the US will take measures to save the environment like the green new deal. This will help the federal government to reduce emissions, encourage states to follow suit and make it easier for people to do the same. While I hope all this transpired, I have a bad feeling that a false sense of security and corruption will continue to halt significant change. Again don’t get me wrong, I think elections and a democratic congress will cause the rate of emissions to decrease, but I don’t think it will be as significant as we need to  save our environment. Even if democrats control the house, big corporations who profit from degrading the environment will continue to pay off politicians to fight any restrictions on their business and profit. This also causes me to believe that the green new deal will be passed, but it will only be passed after being altered, so it could appeal to more politicians, like not restricting corporations. These corporations as you and I have both learned are going to keep their emissions up if not increase them to help their own industry.  The other bigger contributor to emissions, actually the biggest cause of emissions, is going to continue to be the everyday culture that 1st world countries live. Without any immediate impact, people will continue to think they are fine doing whatever they want. Most will change little things, but is it enough. I know you won’t have more than 2 kids, get an electric car, an environmentally friendly fridge, but I know you will still eat meat after trying to be vegetarian. Even just being vegetarian supports the agriculture industry that relies on massive amounts of animals that cause significant emission. If I know you won’t do all you can to save our planet, what faith can I have in the rest of the people in this country, let alone the world. I can see after initial improvement with reducing emission, level will steadily rise as more countries become developed. In 2020, we see more and more countries gaining more wealth and buying things like cars, consuming meat and doing other things that increase their emissions. With more people increasing their emissions I doubt that we can save the planet, even if the US makes green change. I know we are a leader in the world and have influence which could spur other 1st world countries to take similar measures like the green new deal to lower emissions, but our influence isn’t going to stop countries who are struggling to continue to develop and cause more emissions.


                    <br><br>

Again, I believe we will answer the call to cause change in this year and decade, but I predict a progressive increase in emission after this decade as other countries develop. With this in mind I am sorry for the future. We will do our best to try to prevent a dystopian future for setting upon the future you live in, but I don’t know if we can do it. I am afraid populated cities like Florida will be underwater, species will go extinct like the various sea life in the acidifying ocean and those losing their homes as forest get cut and burned down. The panic will hurt our form of life and governments will lose hold economies will fall as we run out of resources. This will cause a more extreme version of the situation that we see now, with people scrambling to buy essentials from markets and just living in fear of what is going to happen next.

                    <br><br>


I know you are about 60 now and probably have a family and even though things probably don’t look good, I urge you to still do your part. Do more. Continue riding your bike like you did when you were in high school and didn’t have a car. Ride your bike with your family and make it special. Try to diet again. Start small, but continue to make progress like you did in the year 2020. If you shift your diet away from chicken like I am right now, you will still be cutting down emissions by a lot and from there start to move away from meat and meat products completely. I believe there is still time because of what we did in 2020 and that decade, but I believe the main focus for your time is consistency. Yes, you have better technology that helps to lower emissions more than right now, but that can’t be it and it shouldn’t be an excuse for us as a society to fall back into bad habits. Continue to show the change you want through your actions and by voting for people who will fight for the environment. Best wishes, and continue to do you, because I know you care about our planets and the other people who live on it.



</p><hr>


<p>

I’m 60 years old now, and look at the world now, it is very much different from that in your age. I remember that in your age there were many social and environmental problems, and you were aware of the climate change that’s going to alter human’s wellbeing, but now, even there are still problems,  the world has changed in an observable way, which is mainly resulted from actions from you and many others of your generation. Let me explain to you how does the world look like now.
                     <br><br>

First, I want to talk about the political changes happened in the past several decades, which I believe were causing significant changes to our environment. When you are twenty, the US Congress raised a “Green New Deal” that stimulated a lot of controversy and influences. However, fortunately, after some modifications to make the deal more practical and specific, the deal was being realized gradually and the US has been increasing the percentage of renewable energy, transportation systems have been upgraded to make them both more available and efficient, and there have been more companies and organizations dedicated to a more efficient allocation of food resources. I am really, really happy to see these changes. As I’m from China, I was inspired by these changes and want to make these differences in China as well, which was the biggest polluter in your age. As you know, China was investing a lot on renewable energy, but there were also a lot of other problems that need to be addressed. Specifically, after graduated from college, I got a master’s degree in environmental economics, and then I studied and researched in a Chinese university to try to integrate my knowledge into the situations in China. After that, I tried to address the issue of food waste and food resource distribution in China by working in the government and promoting related policies; I also tried to address the contraception issue in some rural areas of China, and China has been experiencing improvements in these aspects. 
                     <br><br>

Second, I want to talk about the effect of personal and collective actions on our world. As more people became aware of the climate change, they started to reduce their climate footprint by reducing the amount of beef they eat, reducing their personal flights, and using electric bikes or cars more often than fossil-fuel driven cars. More adoption of these personal actions also congregated into some activism as you can see in the past years when people gathered and advocated to divest interests from fossil fuel industries and better infrastructure for biking and public transportation. However, there are also many people who just don’t want to change their lifestyles, while we cannot force them to change their personal actions, the main cultural trend has been raised now and you can see that people are becoming more and more rational regarding their consumer behaviors and tend to consider the environmental and social externalities of a product when buying them. Moreover, rather than pursuing materialistic wealth like big houses and fancy cars (which I believe was still popular in your age), more people are aware of the internal and spiritual richness, which I firmly believe is crucial to a person’s long-term well-being and happiness. Ahh, I forgot to mention that I also promoted a series of public advertisements on pursing quality of goods rather than quantity and internal peace and happiness rather than external wealthiness in China and am trying to extend them to other parts of the world. I totally understand that lifestyle changes are not so easy and probably cannot be realized really quickly, but in the past several decades, observable changes have happened and most importantly, you can see people actually smiling more and our environment becoming more harmonious! How delighted to see that!
                     <br><br>

I must admit that not everything is so smooth and delighted as I just described. The battle with fossil fuel industry was so difficult and there were even threats to environmentalists’ life, and some corporations also did not care about their negative environmental and social impacts at all, as they only care about their interests and profits. Well, it’s really, really hard to change how they operate, but don’t forget, there are also companies like Patagonia that thrive while being very much responsible for the environment and society. I actually worked for Patagonia for a while (it’s probably more accurate to say that I learnt from them) and I was inspired by their operation system and believed that if we cannot reduce the number of firms solely pursing profits, we can increase the number of firms pursing quality, trust, and responsibility. So, as a person working in the government, I tried to implement certain policies like ecological tariff to products not considering externalities and subsidies to products that have met certain environmental and social standards. By doing things like that, more firms have been trying to be more conscious of their negative externalities. Moreover, although firms may not have big sales, each product has a better quality and is more expensive, and companies can still make a profit. More importantly, since people became calmer about materialistic super wealth, corporations’ focuses have also been shifting from solely making profits. Additionally, businesses’ actions are also closely connected to the above-mentioned changes in consumer culture, as consumers largely determine what producers produce. As education affects consumers to value more on durability and quality of a product, producers also tended to prioritize those factors. You can see that fast fashion has been weaning, which is good to see, but at the same time we are having challenges such as to monitor how companies produce and meet their environmental and social standards, and we are still trying to improve these aspects of companies. 
                     <br><br>

There are so many things that I want to share with you, the successes we have had, the challenges we have met, the problems we are still facing, and the world we are trying to make better of…Dear Shirly of 20 years old, I really hope you can maximize your potential to make the world a better place. Learn knowledge, and also act upon it.

A letter from 2060                     <br><br>

In 2020, a year after I joined the movement of veganism, the world joined as well each in their own way (vegetarian freegan climatarian etc.) As a country, we stepped away from animal agriculture reducing our carbon and methane production. At the same time, other countries followed our lead and now, 40 years later, the majority of people get their nutrients from plants like lentils rather than farmed sick animals. Additionally, all grocery stores nationally signed agreements to only stock products that are seasonal to avoid the cost on the climate from importing asparagus in the winter and such. As a result, we are taking control of the climate crisis, we are no longer in a drought, and as a country physically a lot healthier. During this movement, a carbon tax was implemented for all companies leading them to move towards solar, wind, and other forms of energy. As it turned out we did have the technology to do this and reduce our emissions drastically. It became cheaper and cheaper to have alternative energy sources as more companies transitioned and now our country runs on green energy. Every home, every store, and every building. 
                     <br><br>


I am sure in 2020 your car seems like your whole world and transportation without it seems unrealistic. Around 2025 the public transportation system was remodeled so that electric trains and buses ran through the city. Cars immediately became unnecessary and too expensive due to gas prices being raised. Currently other than the occasional electric car, cars are nonexistent. Electric public transportation was adopted worldwide and is one of the main reasons there is no longer a climate crisis. The average person’s carbon emission drastically reduced. All the roads were restructured into safe bike lanes for people who prefer biking as transportation. Biking and wearing helmets no longer has a social stigma to it. Everyone supports biking as it is very common and kind to the environment. I remember back in 2020 when no one ever biked for transportation except on campus.

                     <br><br>

The average home is now significantly smaller, the trend of minimalism and simplicity that sparked around 2020 has grown and grown into helping save the planet. Community living spaces have been beneficial to people's quality of living and to carbon emission. More land is available for farmer's markets and for community beneficial spaces. Most huge companies from 2020 have closed down now or transitioned into slow fashion. This is all due to people taking control of their influence in the market and only demanding high-quality goods, only what is needed, and making a more influential larger market for thrifting. 2020 was a daunting time climate-wise, where there was a lot of fear for lack of hope. Stay focused and determined though to implement climatarian actions in your everyday life and keep talking about issues. The movement will grow and people will be politically motivated to vote, get involved, and make these changes a reality.

To My Dear Children, 
                      <br><br>

I got out of work and went to pick you guys up from preschool and took you to the local park.  While I was watching you happily play in the grass, seeing how beautiful it was outside, I started reminiscing about the past to my college days when a lot of things were yet to unfold. As I had some time today I decided to write a letter for you guys, which I could give you when you're older and give you some insight about how we managed to save our beautiful planet.  
                     <br><br>

 In my first year in college, in 2020 the climate crisis was getting progressively worse and nothing was really being done. I myself was unaware of the extent of the damage we were causing our planet yearly and like the majority was going along with our daily lives. It wasn’t until I took the Climate Crisis 101 class that I was able to learn about the climate crisis and get a deeper understanding of what is actually going on. Before I had heard of the climate crisis, but it was not something I even thought about as I was preoccupied with other things. Yet having the crisis explained in a well structured class with facts and seeing various sources on the matter it opened my eyes. I remember thinking how scary it was that we have a real life problem about the course of our planet and essentially the survival of the human race, but there is nothing being done! Thankfully we managed to get ourselves on the right path in the nick of time, with some changes being implemented at the end of 2020. We managed to pass the green new deal although it received a lot of push back at first, but after having a few weird climate occurrences like the one in Ventura that had a rare tornado people came around at the realization of the danger. It also helped that college students did their best in promoting the climate crisis in more than 3000 universities in the United States and even some in other countries. I am proud to say that UCSB was one of the first universities to be 100% renewable energy and changed the way the dining commons were set up to prevent food waste. The younger generation took up social media platforms to promote the green movement and it was difficult for people to take it seriously at first, but after being more informed by many sources with facts and videos, people came around. The Green Movement was trending for a whole year, even celebrities started getting behind the movement and started showing support. This allowed for pressure to be put on the government about taking action, specifically with having the green new deal altered and passed. 
                     <br><br>

 The government was in turmoil for a while especially with the fear of socialist changes, but came around after seeing the people discontent. People from all over gathered and protested outside the white house for 4 months and the green movement became popular on the news as it got a lot of views, so  the government had no choice but to start addressing the issue. The government also established a carbon fee and dividend to discourage the large emissions of CO2. For a while people were upset about the changes which discourage car use and declining jobs in the fossil fuel industries but the government created several projects with more bus routes, bike lanes, and public transportations in almost every state in the U.S which created more employment. Progressive groups globally started to promote education to both women and men about planned parenthood to encourage a less dramatic population growth each year. After companies realized that the real money was going to start being made in renewable energy they took measures to try to switch to renewable energy somewhere able to transition with the deep funds and others had to foreclose. The stock market was in a bit of chaos the first couple of years not going to lie, the economy was not at the best but by 2030 the economy was pretty stable. The food industry also had to make some changes to reduce methane emission due to government regulations.  Restaurants still serve beef and other meats, but the prices went up and the companies would have to have various days monthly  in which their menu had to be meat free, which helped reduce the amount of meat being consumed. Since a lot less meat was being demanded, the meat industries cut back a lot on the meat produced each year. That being said, the meat industries took a hard hit, but they started investing in plant based foods so they wouldn’t go out of business. Society had to radically change which was very difficult to do in a decade, but without having an option people adapted. Countries saw the change the U. S was making and dreading that they would  fall behind to this new way of living and decided to start making their own changes for a more environment friendly way of living. An agreement was also signed by all the countries with actual consequences this time so that countries would stay truth to their word. 
                     <br><br>

By the time you read this it will be 2060 you will be heading to college and you will have received this letter before you go. I thought this letter could provide you with an important piece of our history and how we got here, but also to perhaps inspire you. I wrote this letter in hopes that you will read this and find some comfort in knowing that despite all the conflicts that may occur around the world, that in dire times the human race eventually comes around to guarantee our survival. So don’t stress too much when things all around  seem to be going downhill. Also to encourage you that if you believe in something to fight for it, my generation took action despite not knowing if it would result in anything. So go to university and learn not just the needed information, but to also grow as a person and see things from a way you hadn’t before. Be brave enough to picture an even better future and to be willing to fight for what is worth fighting.
                      <br><br>

P.s. Get a decent amount of sleep and food, please. 
                     <br><br>
With love,                      <br><br>

Some new generation today, includes Greta Thunberg of course (yes, she again), are blaming the old generation (Ken’s generation) for polluting the environment and not protecting the environment. In the future, when the new generation becomes the old generation, when new generation (our children) appears, if the climate crisis still exist and is a problem, what can we do? Do we blame the new generation, or do they blame us? These are all possible, right?
                     <br><br>

Besides blaming, will people in the future still finding excuse if the climate crisis still exist? Now, people normally give a lot of excuses for the climate crisis, seems like the climate crisis is not solvable. Yet, in the future, will people still do this? I guess this is still possible, correct? I am not being pessimistic. I am just telling people the facts. The facts are not always beautiful, but they are still facts. People should admit the facts. This is the only way and the first step.
                     <br><br>

In the future, will there be a second new Professor Ken upload a new video about 20 guidelines to avoid climate crisis onto YouTube? Will people obey those 20 guidelines or people ignore them as some of them do now? These are all possible, right? Can people still afford to ignore these 20 guidelines if the climate crisis is more severe at that time? Will those 20 guidelines totally similar to 20 guidelines Ken uploaded? Who won’t be the first time reading them?
                     <br><br>

This is not just being sarcasm and pessimistic. (Well…it kinda is) But, the point is, how to make people realize the seriousness of the problem and start to take action? How to make people not to be formalism? This is the reason why laws and regulations are needed. Although people tend to blame a lot of things on the government, laws and regulations are needed. Also, people shouldn’t always blame others. Instead, introspect on self.

I totally agree with your point of view. We definitely need to take some useful actions in order to improve our society. It is our responsibility to make it a better place to live.

<br><hr>
There are a lot of questions that people can think about regarding the issues of climate crisis. Why I always ask people to take action? Because people themselves will be influenced by the situation. Protecting the environment is to protect people themselves. The Earth doesn’t need people to protect. It has survived over billions of years, and it will still survived billions of years because that is how the universe works.

To my children:                      <br><br>

The year is 2060, and I am already 60 years old. I have three kids, two boys and one girl. Today I want to tell you all something that I never told you guys. Look outside, the sky is blue, and there are many birds flying and singing. You can play outside, breathe fresh air, and drink clear water. However, in 2020 when I was in college, the situation is not as good as it is now. We were experiencing the biggest climate crisis in human history. You might haven’t heard of the word “climate change” or “global warming”, but we were actually experiencing it. During that time, most people know climate change is real and is happening, but only a few people act to mitigating the crisis. I am one of these people who knew the situation was bad but didn’t start to act. Until I took the class Climate Crisis 101, I realized that we have to act immediately and decisively. This class not only inspires me to act but only tells me especially what I can do to deal with climate change. I still remember our professor Ken said that his generation failed to mitigate climate change, so the next generation which is my generation has to take responsibility. In addition, I still remember what Ken said the twelve things each of us can do to save the planet. The first ten focuses on individual actions and the second ten focus on political and collective actions. These individual actions include the change to a plant-based diet, stop wasting food, fairly educate girls and boys and so on. At the polling place, when we cast our vote for candidates, advocating candidates who are sweeping climate policies. We can explain the importance of voting on behalf of our planet to our family and friends and encourage them to vote. Additionally, at gathering places, we join together to demand actions that are beneficial to our planet. At first, I think I don’t have the ability to do these things or even if we do so, it is not a big deal to the world. This class tells me that one doesn’t need to be rich or powerful to make a difference. I think this is a very important point. As Peter's friend Rob Greenfield says in the documentary “Being the Change”, "Individual action is every bit as important as a collective action. Together, we can make the world different.” We are indeed making a difference. 
                      <br><br>
In 2030, more and more people started to be aware of climate change and started to act. Many people start to reduce their carbon footprint by giving up driving and moving into a small house. The government begins to pay more effort to deal with climate change by regulating the climate emission, promoting renewable energy, protecting and restoring key ecosystems, and issues carbon permits to fossil fuel companies.
                     <br><br>
 In 2040, we made huge progress. The global average carbon emission was reduced to one-third of the emission in 2020. The global temperature stops rising. The good news is that people are getting used to living with fewer fossil fuels and we feel happier with fewer fossil fuels. We enjoyed riding bicycles, becoming vegan, and cohousing. 
                     <br><br>
 Now we are in 2060. Although the situation has been improved a lot, we have not completely solved it. We have much more to do. This relies on your generation, my children. You and your generation have better education and technology than us, so I believe you can do better than us. One day, we might be able to live without fossil fuels and reduce zero carbon dioxide. I hope your children could live on a more clear planet than you do.

<p>

To 2020 me:
                     <br><br>


You did good kid. 
                     <br><br>


Up until the time you’re reading this, you’ve communicated to friends when they asked, told them about climatarian and freegan. And how much more effective it is than only 5% US population changing to vegan. Sent videos of how cool public transportation is in other countries, suggested public transportation whenever you could. It was fun, too. Bus rides with friends, talking to other people on the bus. Voted. First time too, huh? 
                      <br><br>

You’re probably hoping for the brighter future. With the green new deal, and maybe the plenitude economy so you can spend more time with people you love, doing things you love? You’ll get there. But you gotta keep at it. Personal action, collective action, communication. Oh yeah, your future plans for cohousing with friends in SJ. Good on you, saving money. Now I don’t have to buy hella stuff because we share. Did you know Long is a great farmer? Somehow he ends up being the person teaching you how to save your plants and crops. And he makes cool contraptions too in his free time.
                     <br><br>


Guess what? We have a community garden in SJ, we have superblocks, our public transportation is hella faster, and walking is so much more fun. More trees for shade, less air pollution from cars, and it’s safer. You bike lots with your friends because it’s safer too. You know in animes when people take the high speed rail?  YUP. :) 
                     <br><br>


Oh, happy fun times revolting against corporations. I mean you were peaceful about it. No burning down buildings or throwing rocks at windows for you. Marches, protests, strikes, boycotts, and voting. The US is off fossil fuels; California installed more geothermal heat pumps. Access to contraception and abortion is availiable to everyone in the US, there’s free education to that solved the population issue. There’s a food waste collecting system and fees like they do in South Korea. Other countries thought “wow, if the US can do it, so can we” and followed. 

                     <br><br>

But some things you gotta know: it wasn’t easy getting here, and as you know, effects of CO2 are long lasting, and species don’t bounce back that easily. So yeah, we didn’t save some animals in time. A lot of climate refugees will come to America. You won’t have seafood for a while because 70% of coral will be gone by 2050, but hey, it’s better than the predicted 90%. You’ll still have to deal with smoke and school getting disrupted for like 10 more years. Miami and Bangladesh are gone. You’ll have to deal with lots of hurricanes. One tornado hit California. The one in Ventura was a warning. The next one actually damages a lot, so prepare for that. Prepare for larger fires too. Since change didn’t happen fast enough, sadly there is a fire larger than the Paradise fire. But this time, there is no Trump, so those people get financial aid. 

                     <br><br>

You’re probably worried about Biden and COVID19 too, huh… you’re probably disappointed in how 2020 is turning out, huh? With Tokyo Olympics cancelled, concerts cancelled, people getting sick, you having to take online courses, people fighting over toilet paper and hoarding medical supplies. 

                     <br><br>

In retrospect, 2020 is an important year. Interesting times you’re living in. 2020, perfect vision, shedding light on all the issues (“only when it is dark enough can you see the stars”). Less flying, travel bans highlighted the effects of air travel on the atmosphere and decreased NOx and CO2 emissions, although it was only 2% of emissions globally, it showed that only a privileged few contributed to that. Climate change made COVID19 stronger. Lack of testing (because it’s EXPENSIVE) further the spread, people were unwilling to take sick days because money>anything else, right? Leaders wanted to distract us from the real issues by war mongering. Pointing fingers at each other, wanting to fight in the middle east (again), for fossil fuels. But you were done with this. This was a chance to change things, but another war? No. Military deficit spending to revive the economy? More fossil fuels to burn and distract us from climate change? This was a chance to change to a plenitude economy. Food insecurity could lead to community gardens and supplemental economic systems within communities. The quarantine gave us practice of more time to spend with family instead of working and traveling less. Eventually we got free health care from COVID19.
                     <br><br>


Biden wins. BUT just because Biden is president doesn’t mean our fight ends. What kind of fool would give up hope? There are other places you can vote; the president doesn’t control everything. From the ground up, get those changes. 

                     <br><br>

Here’s how you did it: you helped CALPIRG out, went to Storke for COLA, emailed, texted, and called the mayor regarding the planned oil thing in Santa Maria, you asked CALPIRG why there’s an oil ship off the coast of Santa Barbara, a city that’s “environmentally friendly,” and asked about food waste in the dining commons. I get it, you’re concerned about not focusing 100% on your studies, but honestly, you have the time. Just manage it better. Also, SPEAK UP. If you’re not happy with something or want something, say it. Dude, turns out the ideas you had were important. 

                     <br><br>

So yeah, 2020 was an important year, an interesting year; the future is what you make of it.

Dear future self, I am writing this short message to you. I am now currently taking my Engl23 class here at UCSB and learning about the climate crisis. I don't know what will be happened in 40 years from now, however, I wish all the climate crisis which I have to face right now will be completely eliminated in 2060. For instance, I really hope that CO2 emission problem could be solved at that time. From my perspective, this is one of the most severe issues that our current society has to confront. What's more, it is necessary to call on minimalism to all future people. Once it has been carried out by most of people, it is more likely that our society can make a better improvement. 
                     <br><br>

I believe 2020 is a turning point for us, it is important for us to make some practicable changes for the climate change. In other words, it is necessary for us to hold the belief of making a little effort in order to improve the whole society.

A Message from the Future:
                     <br><br>


The year is 2060 currently, and I’m here sitting at my kitchen table writing this letter in regard to 19-year-old me in the year 2020 and everything that had led up to this very moment. I remember vividly that 2020 was an extremely unpredictable and stressful year. It started with a World War III scare, and then there was the Coronavirus pandemic. I was in my sophomore winter quarter at UCSB when all of this had hit us. COVID-19 started out small in Wuhan, China, but as people continued to travel and not take it seriously it blew up into a full-blown pandemic. I recall laughing it off thinking it wouldn’t affect my life much at all, but boy was I wrong. It went from memes about Coronavirus, to the university getting functionally shut down and switched to online classes, to outright country wide panic. Mostly amongst the ‘boomers’ of that time because it was most fatal among them. However, during this time I recall being in my Climate Crisis 101 class being confronted with the question of how we would tackle the climate crisis. Then it dawned upon me the panic I had been witnessing from the baby boomer generation was similar to the constant panic I felt regarding the climate crisis. They wondered why we weren’t taking it seriously when people were dying, but the actuality was that it didn’t affect us the same way it did them. Boomers were at a higher risk than us then but putting it into perspective Boomers weren’t the ones who would have to deal with the effects of the climate crisis much like young adults weren’t dealing with the fatal effects of the Coronavirus. Therefore, our levels of caring were clearly different. Unlike the boomers with the climate crisis, many of us were still acting with caution to not put the older folks at risk by taking the necessary precautions to help keep them safe. This is where our morality did not line up with the older generations that didn’t care about our futures. 


                     <br><br>

Fast forward a couple of months, a vaccine was finally created, and as we reached the peak of the bell curve, the panic started to lower and people were being treated and cases went down. We were still doing online classes, but that didn’t stop us from focusing our energy on stopping the climate crisis. The coronavirus in some ways benefited the environment because it prevented certain industries from doing harm as usual. Factories in China had shut down and forced them to lower their carbon emissions by 10%. Worldwide we saw a decrease in carbon emissions, and since 2020 was an election year, our new president had entered us into a new era of the Green New Deal. Our government was following the guidelines of how we could switch to all sustainable power. When I graduated in 2022, I started my path as a professional environmentalist and had to choose just one part of the problem to try and put all my energy into solving, and that was research into Hemp Plastics to replace plastics made from crude oil. My work helped stop the need for fracking. By this time, I was working closely with climate activism organizations, while focusing mainly on my career in plastic solutions. By 2035 we hit our net zero carbon emissions goal, a huge moment for us. We were able to entirely move away from fossil fuels, and my job was able to produce a completely biodegradable, affordable, and practical hemp plastic alternative. 
                     <br><br>



Although our country was able to leave our unsustainable culture behind, there was still the problem of the harm that was already done to our atmosphere. The amount of carbon that was pumped into the atmosphere was devastating for our planet, so we continued to research solutions and develop technology that could reverse the symptoms the Earth was feeling from the Greenhouse Effect. There are so many more things I wish I could discuss, but these are just some of the major things we as a country have done over the past 40 years to mitigate the climate crisis. I hope my legacy is something to be proud of, and I hope my two children and their generation continue to take care of our planet and continue to remember the importance of taking care of the world around you. It’s important that they stray away from anthropocentric ideals and continue to care for all life on Earth. These past 40 years have seen a lot of positive changes for Earth, and I can say that I am satisfied with my actions taken against the climate crisis.



</p><hr>


<p>
Dear my 20 year old self, 
                     <br><br>

I’m writing this after 40 years of experience and wisdom as I’m sure you’re sitting there in disbelief that we somehow made it past our adulthood. I felt the necessity to write to you because I remember 20 being a time full of anxiety and uncertainty. 
                     <br><br>

To preface, I know you are brave, driven, and passionate about changing the world around you. You’ve experienced more hardships than your peers around you and you see the world in a less than positive light because of the cynicism our political system and society have fostered in you. You’re sitting in a class where you hopefully learned that self-driving electric cars are not the solution to our world’s problems, but that a paradigm shift in attitude must occur. I know what it felt like to be sitting there 40 years ago with so many things to worry about in your young, bright years: an election of the century that will determine the trajectory for the middle class in America, governments in the pockets of multi-billion dollar oil companies, and an impending pandemic, all while you’re trying to get your degree. I want to assure you that although this all may feel incredibly paralyzing, you are one individual and you contributed what you possibly could have to combat the climate crisis that faces our entire species. 
                     <br><br>

For one, you’re already making your life’s work dedicated to this crisis by getting an Environmental Studies degree; this is already more than what the American government is doing by denying the climate crisis. You became more and more educated no matter how much weight it felt on your shoulders, you read and shared your knowledge with the world and your peers around you. It was sagacious of you to believe that hoarding the knowledge to yourself was essentially moot point to all the efforts you were taking. You became a climatarian and if you had to waste food, you would compost at home. This effectively reduced many metric tonnes of CO2 and equivalents from your ecological footprint. You also stopped flying and worked nearby enough to walk from home. You joined Climate Citizen’s Lobby to not only share your knowledge with your peers, but with the community around you as well. 
                     <br><br>

I will say that your efforts did not go in vain. Sitting there now, you may feel angry, tired, and defeated that you have to effectively reshape your entire lifestyle against a system and infrastructure that does not support these sustainable habits due to a crisis that you didn’t even contribute to. But whether or not it did anything to save rising sea levels, mass deforestation, displacement of vulnerable communities, and everything else you’re worried about, what you did changed your life for the better. You became happier, your life had more meaning, and your work had a purpose larger than yourself. Rejecting the notion that the American dream is about big houses and fancy cars was one of the most monumental things you can do for yourself and for your surrounding community. 
                     <br><br>

I however, look back with regret. You voted, demanded, and protested. But America did not prevail and rise to the occasion. We elected moderate candidates like Joe Biden because they were “safe” but this ultimately did nothing to create a fundamental change in our social and economic structure. America failed us all, they crumbled under the pressure and couldn’t fight for voiceless, the communities of color, the future generation. A Green New Deal was never passed and the government stayed in the pockets of billion dollar oil companies like Exxon and Koch Industries despite what the moderate left might want to think of their saviour Joe Biden. 
                     <br><br>

I hope this letter burns a fire in your soul. I hope you never stop working for what you believe in, even if it means you have to die trying never seeing the day that you want to see come. Future generations will see it because of what you will do and accomplish. Don’t succumb to the politics of America and don’t run away from the challenge. I believe in you. 

Sincerely,                     <br><br>

Your 60 year old self

<p>
A message from the future:
                     <br><br>

To whom it may concern,
                     <br><br>

I don’t know who needs to hear this but I know someone does. It is the year 2060 and I have so much to tell you. I never thought I would be able to say this but the United States of America has finally admitted to their complacency regarding the climate crisis and has begun to make the necessary changes we need. I know it is 2020 and you have probably lost hope the same way I did but, have no fear. Bernie Sanders was elected President. I know, amazing. The Green New Deal was implemented as Democrats ran the House and the Senate. With Sanders in office and climate activists like Greta Thunberg our country was finally led in the right direction. 

                     <br><br>

We began to see our CO2 emissions go down, less natural disasters, and the rich taxed as they deserved. Your generation is right to protest and plead for change. We got it because of your generation's demands. In 2020, it was never enough. The cheeto man was in office and well, you know how that went, there is no need to go down nightmare lane. Our country was in a crisis mode for many different reasons but, the climate topped all. Global temperatures were rising along with sea levels, natural disasters, and extinctions. It was terrifying and it felt like the world was doomed. But we did it. You are doing it. No matter how small the fight you must stay true to yourself because it will all be worth it soon enough. We have made more progress than you can imagine. Our dreams have come true and yours will too. America will soon be in the right hands and if you stay calm and patient. 

                     <br><br>

The planet finally got what it deserved and so did the American people. Even the republicans aren’t complaining for once. There is healthcare for all, our country is more equal than it has ever been, people have made lifestyle changes to help the planet and obesity has gone down, economic and social injustices are almost unheard of, and so much more. I even went to graduate school for free! Americans have lowered our waste, meat consumption, air travel, and so much more. You have so much to look forward to! All you have to do is get to the Presidential election in November. On November 3, 2020 your life will change forever. So don’t give up hope. Keep fighting for what you believe in and stand up against what you don’t. In the near future you will see improvement and it will only get better from there. Everything you are doing will soon be worth it.





</p><hr>


<p>
To whoever is reading this, you need to act now. It's the year 2060, and our planet is beyond salvation. The atmosphere has become polluted to the point where we need masks to go outside. The beautiful, blue oceans that were once teeming with life have been poisoned with acidity, and the millions of lives that depended on its ecosystems have been ruined. Monsoons, hurricanes, and other natural disasters have destroyed cities, and as a result, cities have collapsed. The places that weren't hit by these disasters were instead faced with long droughts, coupled with blistering heat from the sun that transformed landscapes and good land into deserts. This was only the beginning of our suffering.

                     <br><br>

The wars that were fought were even more brutal. Following the economic collapse of the 2040 caused by the shortage of oil, fossil fuel industries of different countries conflicted, and it led to an all out world war, where not a single person was unaffected. The cities that were left fell into chaos, then the bombings happened. I'll spare you the details.
                     <br><br>


Eventually, we finally realized what we were doing, but it was too late. As there was nothing left to gain from more destruction, the survivors came together and tried to come up with ways to salvage our planet. But it was hopeless. Carbon emissions were already at 0, since there was nothing left to burn. Other long term solutions like technology were futile, as much of our resources were destroyed, and we were on a time limit. The air the we breathe is toxic, and our mask filters can only do so much. Finally, we figured out a way to get a message to the past. 

                     <br><br>

I am writing this letter now as humanity's last hope. To whoever is reading this, you can change the way the future plays out. Tell everyone you know about what I've said, how we will ruin the future if we continue on the course we are heading down. Tell them to go green now, stop eating meat, get rid of excess things, and vote not for gun control, or for border security: those issues are irrelevant compared to the climate crisis. 

                     <br><br>

I was also once as naive as you; I remember taking a climate change course at UCSB that warned me of the exact consequences of my actions, yet I did nothing. I thought that it wouldn't affect me, and that if they did the effects would over exaggerated compared to reality. Don't do what our generation did in response to this global crisis. All of us have deep regrets, that we didn't act sooner and more responsibly. Your generation, however, can still make it. I realize that this might be a lot to take in, but please don't be overwhelmed and start to act now. For your children's sake, you can save the planet.




</p><hr>


<p>
To my future self the year is 2060 and 40 years have passed since you took this class at UCSB about the climate crisis that is destroying our planet. Presently it has been made aware to us that the changes to reverse the damages done to the planet cannot be done and it is already too late, and our actions now are to diminish the damage rather than reverse them. I hope our government has changed to become more environmentally friendly and the Green New Deal proposed became a largely comprehensive action to a create greener initiatives. 
                     <br><br>

A part of me believes that we won’t be successful in acting on the climate crisis and our forests are going to be destroyed and our oceans will rise and be poisoned by us. I believe most of us will be forced to live in cities crowded with people and the changes we take will not be enough. Regardless of my pessimism towards our people on failure to act I hope you individually are making changes to lead a lifestyle that is more sustainable. I hope to be living a life with massively reduced carbon emissions and hopefully fully adopt a plant-based diet. More importantly I hope you will plan to educate future generations on the importance of living a lifestyle that is friendly to the environment.

<p>
It all started in 2017 when the United States withdrew from the Paris agreement. The following year in 2018, the IPCC produced a report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels relating to global greenhouse gas emission pathways. This report gave scientists high confidence that any warming higher than 1.5 degrees would have extremely detrimental effects on human and natural systems through “intensity and frequency of extreme events, on resources, ecosystems, biodiversity, food security, cities, tourism, and carbon removal” and this is exactly the future we saw as we reached 4 degrees above the allotted budget. While other countries were able to prolong their downfall, the United States was the first to collapse, as emissions were not limited through the Paris Accord any longer. 
                     <br><br>
The IPCC report focused on natural and human systems and pointed out several crucial risk points based on their obtained knowledge. A strong concern brought about by this IPCC report are the trends of intensity in weather patterns culminating after pre industrial temperature levels. In 2019 Hurricane Dorian was the first storm to ever be considered for the title of a category 6 hurricane, and in 2022, the United States had not one, but three category 6 hurricanes decimating the coast line causing billions of dollars in damage and taking the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The unregulated increase of anthropogenic human activity was already leading to higher surface temperatures in 2020, culminating these intense weather patterns. With no regulation it is expected to just get worse.
                     <br><br>
 We now live in fear these destructive weather patterns such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, storms, and heat waves which have such strong negative impacts on human and natural systems leading to an increased risk of illnesses, death, and destruction. Countries such as Japan and Philippines have lost half of their coastline to increased sea levels leaving some small islands completely submerged underwater. The Sahara Desert is expanding at an unprecedented rate. Heat waves in summer have taken the lives of too many to count. Countries such as China and India have such unsafe air conditions people are rarely seen outside, they look nearly abandoned. Regardless of a higher risk of these extreme weather patterns, we are also seeing almost complete acidification of our oceans. The excess carbon dioxide being released in the atmosphere and then absorbed into the surface of the ocean at an alarming rate the PH of the ocean is lowering. The Great Barrier reef is now completely white and all coral destroyed, only leaving a few safe reefs throughout the world, leaving researchers out of jobs as there is nothing left to study. These alien chemicals continue to threaten a new biosphere everyday all because humans could not sacrifice their anthropogenic interference in nature. As carbon emissions increase temperature in another natural system, the threats to the balance of Earth are eminent. Careless and unregulated increase of carbon emissions resulted in a loss of half of the species on earth. Giraffes and Rhinos are now extinct. This is a pivotal point in history, as most all of the predicted effects have become true. 
                     <br><br>
Another projected issue that comes hand in hand with the increase is the risk of water scarcity. While even now with a slight increase there are already issues with supply of water, if the threshold is passed, all of humanity is in danger as we have not created a way to desalinate salt water. 
                     <br><br>
After all of these effects we are at a loss of how to reverse our emissions and must suffer the consequences of our inability to act. We had the technology and chose to do nothing about it and look where we are now.



</p><hr>


<p>

A message from the future:
                     <br><br>

It is the year 2060 and the world is harsh and bleak. We ultimately failed to rise up against climate change and we refused to see how our actions brought about our planet's demise. There were some people that tried to change their lifestyles, who gave up their material possessions and found happiness with others. These people were the only ones to find true happiness and formed long lasting relationships with friends and family. However, the majority of us were too lazy and unwilling to change our lives in order to save the planet. We wanted to keep driving fancy cars and living extravagant lives. Most of us were afraid of change and didn't want to sacrifice our comforts. It sounds selfish, but that's just how we humans are. We don't care about a problem until it starts affecting us personally. 
                     <br><br>

The people in charge of this country refused to take action against climate change. They were more interested in making more money instead of prioritizing our planet. The media continued to spread misinformation about climate change to scare and control people. If climate change is real, why is the weather still cold? An increase in 1.5 degrees isn't that much, the media said. Since the effects of climate change took so long to notice, we were not motivated to do anything. Even though scientists urged us to do something and that there was so much evidence for climate change, we still did nothing. It wasn't until the Arctic began melting rapidly, droughts became more frequent, crops began dying, that things changed.
                     <br><br>

It wasn't until the 2050s that we saw the consequences of doing nothing. Sea levels had risen drastically and some islands were submerged underwater. Wildfires became even more frequent as vegetation became drier. Many cities in California have been destroyed by fires and many have lost their homes. Food has become scarce as thousands of acres of crops die because of droughts. Tensions between countries are increasing as different countries become desperate for food and water. People are migrating to other countries to find shelter. It is inevitable that wars shall soon start.
                     <br><br>

People are scared. I'm also scared. There's almost no chance left at turning back climate change. The U.S. has started rationing food and water to people. With less rain, less food is grown and there might not be enough to feed everyone. The world is slowly breaking down into chaos. Some people have started living underground in order to escape our reality. Will my country also break down into fear and war? I just want to escape this madness! Honestly, it would have been so much easier if we had just gotten our act together and decided to do something about climate change before it was too late. If only we could've saw the consequences of our actions, we probably would've been startled into action. But as the world slowly dissolves into chaos, we only have ourselves to blame. I was too lazy and weak to act. We shall pay for our blindness in blood and tears.

A message from the future:
                      <br><br>

It is the year 2060, and I can’t help but reflect back on one class I took at UC Santa Barbara in the year 2020, not knowing how much that class would have an impact on my life. I seem to have made the right choice in taking it. Climate activism was gaining momentum, and I was eager to learn new ways that I could be a part of that change. I now at times you felt discouraged. Professor Ken kept reminding students that if there was one thing you were to do to alleviate this climate crisis it would be to vote. But you didn’t have that power. You were frustrated, going to school in a seemingly superpower of a nation who was responsible for so much damage, yet their government was unwilling to take the responsibility. Trump didn’t even believe it existed. But, I’m here to tell you that the fight of your professor and the peers around you did make a different. You all didn’t fight for nothing.
                      <br><br>

Just as you were about to graduate, the US rejoined the Paris Climate Accord. And this time, there were consequences for not upholding their part of the deal. I wish I could say that the Green New Deal was signed too, but this just wasn’t the case. On the bright side, the youth were fired up. The older generation also started getting more involved, finally noticing that they needed to change. And of course, the government was no longer infiltrated by climate deniers (thank god). 
                      <br><br>

After college, you moved home. But you still made progress in living a low waste lifestyle. You tried to use public transportation as much as you could back home. Thrifting finally became culturally relevant, and almost everyone was into it. You decided it was time to cut meat from your diet, and have convinced your family to follow your lead. Sure, you eat chicken every now and then, but hey, no one’s perfect. The UN started playing a large role in educating women, and successfully reduced the speed at which our population was growing. 
                      <br><br>

I am not going to lie, at times you still feel helpless. You watch the United States do their best, but you cannot control one of the most influential countries in the world. But don’t worry, their obsession with beef has subsided (I know you never understood their love for it, but at least it’s gone), the fast fashion has diminished (yes, they stopped taking advantage of developing countries) and they are doing their absolute best to move away from fossil fuel reserves. 
                      <br><br>

Now that it is 2060, I will say I wasn’t sure that the states were capable of such change. But it is because of your peers, devoted professors and even international students like you that cared. Don’t ever stop caring, because something WILL come out of it. On behalf of your future self, and the new generation, we thank you. I will not say that your generation has done absolutely every single thing necessary, but you did try, and are still trying. 
 
Sincerely,                     <br><br>

Your future self

The year is 2060 and as I sit here and look back on the past, I can’t help but reflect on my time at UCSB in professor Ken’s Climate Crisis class. I remember taking other classes that centered around the environment and the climate crisis, but this one by far was the best due to all aspects being shown including pointing out possible solutions we could all take. The class was informative, inspirational, hopeful, and it helped change my everyday lifestyle for the better. 
                      <br><br>

We were given so many warnings on what to expect from the climate crisis in the coming years. I remember sitting in class terrified after knowing what could happen not only in my lifetime but future generations. Learning that the Earth has had 5 mass extinctions and we were currently living through the 6th really frightened me. With rising temperatures many horrific consequences would emerge. I was told that if we didn’t lessen our emissions, by 2080 many parts of the world including southern Europe will be turned into deserts as a result of droughts. Rising sea-levels would lead to floods and many cities left underwater. I have lived near the ocean my whole life and knowing in the future our coastal communities could be vanished due to our own actions really left me devastated and wanting to fight for change. It makes me angry that people sit back and refuse to look at the science and accept that this is happening. My generation knew about, past generations have known about it, and yet we continue to let this happen without putting an end to it. I remember how important it was to get people to vote during 2020, how important it was for political action to address issues of climate change. We have the power to change our future and encouraging others to vote is really important. 
                      <br><br>

After watching Ken’s lecture videos, and the films assigned to us while being enrolled in the class, they left me inspired and wanting to change my lifestyle. I remember I wasn’t a big meat eater but would occasionally have chicken. After learning about the positive benefits of living a plant-based diet, I wanted to slowly transition to become vegan. Looking back now, I remember the great times I had in college cooking with my housemates and searching for vegan recipes that we could all have for dinner. Not only was it fun to make together but the food always turned out so great. Switching to this lifestyle was not only healthy and benefiting me, but also the environment. I was so glad my roommates were also willing to try it out and it made the transition a lot easier with having all of us eat very similarly. We also used drying racks rather than a dryer in order to save energy and lessen emissions. 
                      <br><br>

I also remember I thought about how I traveled and took note of what we were taught in class on how to lessen our carbon footprint. I was really fond of the idea of slow travel. Knowing that if I took a train or bus rather than a plane, it would lessen CO2 emissions made me gladly make the switch. I found myself traveling more by public transportation and learned to enjoy the journey. I also encouraged family members to tag along so it would be more entertaining and also kept one less car off the road or one less plane ticket needed to be filled. This is how I got around often and I was completely ok with it. Although it might not seem like a big change it helped lessen my overall carbon footprint while traveling. 
                      <br><br>

Looking back on my lifestyle before and after taking English 23 may not seem like huge differences were made but to me, I felt like I was a whole new person. Knowing that if I changed my habits I could help our environment, made me feel hopeful and empowered. But, not only one person’s actions could help reverse what has been made and we would need to act collectively, as a whole to help fight climate change.

2020. The year that coronavirus knocked out my first year of college at UCSB. Also the year I decided to take English 23 after first taking English 22 with Professor Hiltner during my fall quarter. I was first intrigued by climate change during Ken’s English 22 class. Every friday for the first 5 weeks he would hold a lecture talking about climate change and the impact it is having on the world. I found it very interesting because I always heard about global warming but I didn’t know anything about it really other than that we should recycle because it is good for the planet. Ken enlightened me on climate change and really grabbed my attention with the amount of staggering figures he threw out in class sometimes. Some of the films he made us watch, like Cowspiracy, further drew me in. I liked discussing the topic with my parents, who ultimately brought a more realistic viewpoint into the discussion for me to consider. I really enjoyed talking about some of the climate issues with all types of people; I found it interesting to see what they had to say about it, and what was most interesting to me was that everyone seemed to have a somewhat different opinion on the subject matter. Some people thought it wasn’t that big of a deal, others said it frightened them and made them become vegetarian or vegan. However, no one I met ever denied that climate change was actually happening. I found this odd because on the news and social media and even in some of Ken’s content you’d often hear about or see people who outright said that climate change wasn’t happening. Welp, things are slowly starting to change little by little, and I believe that soon enough, especially within 40 years, we’ll be able to say that we stopped climate change.
                      <br><br>
 Personal actions are just one of the steps that we can take as a people to help mitigate the climate crisis. Peter Kalmus opened up my eyes to some of the small personal changes everyone can make every day. Riding a bicycle, becoming a vegan or vegetarian, eating less meat, whatever little differences you can make as an individual they ARE important. Everyone’s individual effort makes a big difference. Any little action you can take to help reduce your CO2 emissions or reduce climate change, they should be taken. This is not to say that you have to immediately cut everything out of your life, but it’s important to do as much as you can do, little by little, to make the difference you can make.
                      <br><br>
While I understand that personal actions are a large key to turning the tide of climate change, I also believe that the change has to come from the top down. We need to be attacking big oil companies and animal agriculture companies and hydraulic fracking companies, all of which are causing the most amount of CO2 production and climate change. These companies are the biggest contributors to climate change and they need to be held responsible for their actions. Again, I’m not saying to completely wipe out non renewable energy sources so millions of people lose their jobs, I’m saying that we need to transition to using more renewable energy sources. We need to transition away from fossil fuels and invest into technology that can help reduce climate change. I also believe that it's in everyone’s best interest to commit to using less fossil fuel energy like gasoline. This can have a huge effect on climate change. If we were all to transition to using more public transportation, then we could rely less on cars and more on other modes. 
                      <br><br>
These types of changes come from our government, which is why we also need to become more politically active and aware of climate change. Climate change is a universal issue that affects everyone across the world, which is why I believe that it should be looked upon as a bipartisan issue. Both political parties should take climate change seriously and should start implementing real solutions as quickly as they can. While I’m not sure if the Green New Deal is the perfect agreement, I am sure that our government can come to a conclusion on what we need to do for the sake of our planet and our nation. We are the United States of America and we should be the ones leading in this harsh time. It’s our job as the leader of the free world to be the first ones to attack global problems like climate change. 
                      <br><br>
Like with everything, climate change is an issue that needs to be dealt with both individually and globally as nations united. One thing I’ve commented on from the very beginning is about the mindset we need to have as a people. If one person believes that it doesn’t make a difference whether they fly or take a train, then everyone else might be thinking that exact same thing. However, if one person can’t see the difference that they make, then they’ll most likely quit making that difference. This is the wrong approach to take. You have to believe that what you are doing is making a difference, no matter how small or large you think it is. It’s the mindset of knowing you’re doing everything you can to make a difference in the world to help stop climate change. I think that is the most important thing to take away from Ken’s class. Everyone can have the mindset that what they’re doing helps. Anything they can do to help they should be doing, and that’s really what Ken has taught me. Always look for the solution, act on the knowledge you possess, and try to make the world a better place.

Life up to 2060
                      <br><br>

2020 saw an outbreak of the COVID19 which affected people all over the world. In terms of the U.S. and how it affected my community, I finished my Junior year online and stayed in IV for the most part to avoid putting my grandpa at home at risk. Due to fumbles by the President at the time the virus was allowed to spread more than it should have and people panicked because testing was not widespread so it was difficult to know exactly when you had it. People stockpiled stupid things such as toilet paper and created shortages that negatively effected the entire community. Because of a general fear the Presidential election went forward but the voter turnout was the lowest in history. Older individuals stayed in while college students like myself still went out to vote resulting in Bernie Sanders being elected. Climate activism became a major piece of government action.
                      <br><br>

2030 Bernie Sanders remained President for a term and was reelected for a second term however he passed away about half way through his second term, his Vice President took over following his death. This Vice President was reelected in the following years. While climate activism during Bernie’s first term allowed us to extend the life of many species and keep the temperature rise to a minimum, there was a slight pushback in his second term and activism slowed briefly. I continued to vote, support climate activism, and cut out meat after several years, trying to do my part for the environment- though I never ran for any office to effect the change myself.
                      <br><br>

2040 saw another President who did not prioritize the climate. Because some of the legislation that cut off fracking and other industries destructive to the environment  did cause a dip in the economy, people looked for a candidate who would “open the economy” again. This apparently meant a step back from the environment. Though climate change is generally accepted now, people have once again been lulled into a sense of security. The thought is that because we have managed to avoid the catastrophes predicted and we have limited temperature rise we can afford to do some things that are mildly damaging- we were able to stop the apocalypse before, we can do it again if we need to. This idea is fueled by those who still cling to the hope that fossil fuel use will rise again, it is extremely detrimental to the environment. 
                      <br><br>

2050 we are once again fighting to save our planet. More diseases have spread, weather has become even more extreme and we are working to temper climate change. We have completely left all usage of fossil fuels behind and have limited the amount of meat each person is allowed to consume per year. 
                      <br><br>

2060 we are still battling to stabilize as the climate has created more severe weather and forced species into extinction. Right now our main problem is overpopulation and global leaders have been discussing limiting parents to one child (though they are unsure because they do not want to create the problem faced by China after their one-child policy). Overall, climate change has become an extremely important issue in all political debates and people are constantly working to ensure our world survives. Its not ideal but we finally have a united front on this one issue.

To my dear kids,                             <br><br>
                     I was nineteen when I became conscious about the seriousness of climate change after having chosen to take a course on the topic in my undergraduate days at UCSB. I met Professor Hiltner in the fall of 2019 and he gave me that extra push I needed in order to incorporate changes in my life. I stuck with him for two quarters in my second year of college because I believed he was really wise and he was doing more than just teaching. He was a role model to us all, he did not just talk about saving the climate, he also did his part. This man who was sixty years old, my current age, biked from his home to his job on campus every day. That bike ride was more than ten miles one way.                        The year is now 2060 and times are rough, climate change is still a hot topic that has been unaddressed. You are having to fight a battle to save humanity but I am afraid it might be too late for a change. A climate apocalypse has now begun and I am unsure about a bright future for anyone on planet Earth. I write to you because I am getting old and I do not think I will make it see how this apocalypse will play out. I know I’m only sixty but my lungs have weakened from having to inhale unsafe oxygen for the last thirty years.                             I am one of the few people my age who has not passed away and that is due to my lifestyle choices. I cut out beef when I was eighteen for this was the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases right after the practice of fracking. I tried to bike or use public transportation as much as possible not only for the planet but to keep me more physically active. You know dad and I shared a vehicle when you were a kid. The car we owned was a used vehicle and was only used for emergencies. When I would take the subway to work I would often talk to other passengers about their choice to take public transportation which would lead to a conversation about the climate crisis. I made many friends there while spreading awareness on the issue. As you know our family lived in cohousing apartments your entire life for the same reason, dad and I had the environment in mind. Cohousing was probably the best personal choice I made in regards to climate change. It allowed for you to have friends your age who lived right next to you and it provided me with the community support I needed in regards to keeping up with chores and keeping you guys fed.                   I want you to know I tried to avoid the situation we are living in today. I was afraid we would end up here, I thought electing Bernie as president in 2020 along with other pro-environment congressmen would help but this was only a short-lived victory. As our forty-sixth president, Bernie did try to change America for the better by enacting laws such as the green new deal. He led the nation at combating the climate crisis by stopping the consumption of beef in America, putting an end to the extraction of fossil fuels, and implementing a carbon tax. He also set up reforms in the developed world to educate girls on birth control options while making sure they received at least a primary education. This was a big step in decreasing the population. Bernie did great things for humanity, my generation loved him. Unfortunately, like many great men he too was assassinated before being able to serve a second term as president. Many felt he was too much as a socialist and wanted to put an end to his reformist vision. There's a conspiracy theory that the Koch brothers were the murderers behind it all and I seriously do not doubt it.  His death reminded me of J.F.K’s death back in the 1960s, one hundred years before today. I myself was not alive in that period but I had heard of him and believed him to be a great man. Also, he was the most handsome and charming president this nation has ever had but that is total beside the point. The point is those great men who want to make a real change to help those who are in need are brave and do not deserve to be taken from us before their time.               When Bernie passed away, his vice president took over. This man wanted to keep going with what Bernie had started but was unable to do so. There was too much pressure from congress, the senate, and international affairs to revoke all that Bernie had started. Many people all over the world were unpleasant when cows were once again being slaughtered for consumption in huge numbers but were unable to stop the practice. The government became totalitarian and we as the public were defeated. Oil and other natural resources started to be extracted again at double the rate they initially were when the practice was put to an end by Bernie. The carbon tax was eliminated and girls in underdeveloped countries were no longer being educated. It did not take long after the consequences of these actions started to show. We were worse off than before Bernie was sworn into office.                         Seasons became hotter, entire cities were underwater, people from the coasts were migrating, famine from permafrost spread. The world was in utter chaos within a decade. I am sorry you too will now have to live through this as I had to for part of my life. If there is one thing I will never regret is adopting you both. I love you both so dearly and I am glad I was able to give you the best life possible. Daddy and mommy are so proud of you both and hope your flight to planet Mars happens soon. Please treat this new planet with the care that I wish the generations before yourself would have to Earth.                    Love,             Mom

A message from the future:

                      <br><br>

It is the year 2075 and I, a typical citizen of the U.S., write this as a sort of status report to note the current state of affairs that has resulted from the minimal progress made in efforts to combat the issue of the everchanging global climate. If you are unable to read this message in its entirety, simply know that things are getting worse faster than they are getting better and that this future is not entirely inevitable. There will never be a perfect Earth, but such injustice on a global scale should be avoided at all cost. Allow me to elaborate: As it may be in the world of whoever is reading this, the high standard of living in major industrialized societies depends on a ridiculously large amount of fossil fuel combustion. This act alone has resulted in a plethora of unnatural phenomena such as severe droughts, tropical cyclones, rising sea levels. While these disastrous events have had a global effect, those who have suffered the earliest and most are poor people from developing countries who have contributed the LEAST to the energy balance of the global climate system. These societies were, not surprisingly, extremely ill equipped to face such catastrophic events and have resorted to migration in hopes of escaping the only things that remains at home - malnutrition, disease, and death.  As this global crisis only gets worse, the world has to put efforts to reduce fossil fuel combustion on hold to help those displaced by environmental disasters, aptly called climate refugees. Nations have only begun to cooperate on establishing guidelines and provisions to protect climate refugees. 
                      <br><br>

If anything can and should change in the world of whoever is reading this, it is the obsessive dependence on fossil fuel combustion. It is absolutely imperative that wealthy and capable nations must do EVERYTHING it can to reduce and eventually cease fossil fuel combustion to avoid this chaotic future. If you are a person with legislative authority, do whatever it takes to initiate and pass policies that prevent further fossil fuel combustion. If you are an average person who simply wants to do what one can to help, vote, rally with groups of like-minded people, protest, or whatever you can do given your ability and circumstance to fight for a future that is even SLIGHTLY better than the one I currently live in. I once again remind whoever is reading this that a world in which the ones who are the most undeserving of tragedy suffer the most is not inevitable and you all must act NOW before it is too late.

Dear future children,                      <br><br>

Hey it's me your mother Haley speaking to you and it's the year 2020 and I wanna tell you a lot is going on in the world. The climate is worsening and as a result, the ice keeps melting, the sea levels rise, and more species continue to go extinct as each day passes. The coronavirus has people going crazy as they fear for their wellbeings and their families, although I do wish that the American public would act more rationally and not leave stores barren as it hurts those who need supplies, but can't because nothing is left. As I look at how people handle crises here I am disappointed and it justs lets you know not everyone thinks the best in serious situations. I hope people can get it together and work as a united whole rather than against one another, like how some are participating in price gouging. It's just when I think about the future I want better for not only my own family but for the world. Like people shouldn't be living in poverty or going to bed hungry or worrying about if they will have enough money in their paycheck to cover expenses.
                      <br><br>


Right now though the Green New Deal has become a popular discussion amongst politics and honestly, it is a great step forward in educating others of the climate change, but for some, it has made them think that it's like this whole thing where like the government wants to take it all away and is a big waste of money. I'm like what because it is not a waste of money as many future generations would flourish from its effects. Also yeah the environment has been dealing with our problems for a long time, since the industrial revolution and it has only gotten worse and it really ain't cute. But something crazy is that in the Democratic party took control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, so that is powerful as voter turnout really improved, I was 17 and still in high school, but I was still paying attention at a certain extent. It really was great to see a step in the right direction as a House of Republicans would drag us further down into the darkness and make a cleaner future less probable.

                      <br><br>

Also, the Democratic primary is occurring and who we need is Bernie over Biden as Biden isn't the best option, his politics have switched up all the time and have leaned more conservative when he initially was against Roe v. Wade, but now he supports it, then he also played a part in the mass incarceration of black people, so honestly there's a whole lot and I don't want to get into all that. But it looks like Biden might get the spot and it sucks like they really gonna do Bernie dirty again and it makes me frustrated as he's been the better option both times, but some just aren't ready for that discussion. But to take this away from the Democratic primary, there has been some improvement for other nations who are developing more eco-friendly standards of living like more efficient bike paths or community gardens or better public transportation that runs smoothly. So not everything is complete doo-doo as there are actually things to be proud of. Just that the US is falling behind and needs to pick up the slack because at this point it's embarrassing as this country is supposed to be a world leader, but I'm looking like where, where it at though, leading in emissions and military sure but what else like y'all can do better.

The year is 2060, I am 59 years old and sitting at home with my two kids and a husband. It seems like just yesterday I was in Ken’s “Climate Crisis 101” class at UCSB. Oh, how I miss college.  The planet is beautiful, and we finally have taken control of the terrible climate crisis. Leonardo Dicaprio and Bill Gates were very helpful in that. After we nearly missed our opportunity to save our beautiful planet, the Green New Deal was finally put into action. We have all learned how to live a simple life and minimize. Something that wasn't as popular during my time at UCSB. It is so amazing to look back at my college years and see how much our actions have changed. 85% of the United States is eating mostly plant based and 75% of the United States uses a bike as their primary mode of transportation and Environmental Science and Global Warming is taught among all schools K-12. I am so grateful that we were able to save this earth so that I can give my kids a life even more beautiful than mine.

A message from the future:
 
                       <br><br>

September 7, 2060
                      <br><br>

To myself,
                      <br><br>

You somehow managed to make it through the year 2020 (and to your 60th birthday!). It started off with the possibility of war with Iran. Followed, unfortunately, by Justin Bieber releasing “Yummy.” Then, COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic which resulted in you having to spend a quarter in college at home because classes were moved online. While all that was going on, we were also in the middle of a climate crisis. A crisis whose outcome would very likely be determined by the outcome of the 2020 General Election in the United States.
                      <br><br>

Our society knew that we would be doomed if we didn’t take immediate action to remedy the climate crisis. Unfortunately, our current White House occupant wasn’t too inclined to do anything about it since he didn’t believe there was an issue. However, we united as Americans and went out to the polls and voted for a candidate we knew would help solve our issues. We elected a new President that was willing to listen to science and fact. This President took action that was not only effective but was also possible to implement without angering an entire nation.
                      <br><br>

We began to realize that this change was possible and even made our lives more convenient. We completely redesigned the public transportation systems in cities all over the country. Engineers were hired to develop new ways to build electric vehicles that limited the climate footprint not only of the consumer, but also that of the manufacturer. This slowly resulted in gas stations being replaced by government funded charging stations for electric vehicles that were powered by solar energy. New policies were implemented in the public education system to teach young people about the detrimental effects of burning fossil fuels.
                      <br><br>

Years later, we developed efficient ways to travel by air. We knew air travel was both necessary and detrimental to the environment. We focused our efforts on developing new airplanes that didn’t dump tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. We also put regulations in place that restricted airlines from grossly overcharging customers for these flights. This greatly increased accessibility to air travel that was environmentally conscious.
                      <br><br>

Our society flourished and we maintained a habital planet humans. You made it through college and graduate school. You started your career, worked hard, and became successful. All that was possible because we decided to cause change. Now you can have peace of mind knowing that your generation solved an issue that would have been devastating to your children.

Sincerely,                      <br><br>

It’s 2060, wow! As I sit here writing, I think back to a disastrous time in our life… the year 2020. During this time we were all unsure and worried about what was to come. What was our future going to look like with rising climate crisis issues? I for one was very pessimistic and did not believe we could come together and fix this issue. It seemed nearly impossible at the time because of how deep our actions had gotten. However, everything changed once we elected a democrat into office in 2020. This was ultimately our saving grace and allowed us to start making necessary changes that needed to happen ASAP. At the time of 2020 fossil fuel industries dominated, consumerism was at its peak, our personal carbon footprints were ridiculously high, and college was expensive. To think we lived in a time like this is crazy. It’s 2060 now and so much has changed especially after signing the Green New Deal. People started to realize that our futures may be nonexistent due to the lifestyles we lived. With this being said, people started coming together to make necessary changes. 
                       <br><br>
As a group, we sat down and really started to think about the damages being caused to our planet. We successfully elected a democrat candidate into office and this is when changes began to happen. Big corporations started failing slowly and eventually thrifting became one of the most popular ways to shop. Due to this, our consumption as a whole dropped significantly which reduced carbon emissions greatly. We also started to see better bike lanes being built. Before these changes, bike lanes were simply a white line painted on the side of the street which caused many bike/car collisions. Now, we have safer bike lanes which encouraged a large number of people to switch their cars for a bike. This was a huge change for us as a country because cars emitted a significant amount of carbon (especially when a car was built). Since people started using bicycles, car industries have reduced the cars being built. However, one of the biggest things to happen was college now being FREE! While I was in college in 2020, tuition rates were ridiculously high causing many students to have large amounts of debt when graduating. Now, we don’t have to worry about the burden of saving money for our kids to go to college. We can work less and enjoy free time more. This has significantly increased our country's happiness as a whole. In 2020, people were working themselves nearly to death to try and make a “good” living. Now we can relax and spend more time with loved ones and friends.
                      <br><br>
It’s honestly crazy to think back on the year of 2020. So many changes happened since then for the better. I always think to myself now, “what if we didn’t make these necessary changes”?  If we did not take action when we did, I may not be here writing this letter right now. You may not be sitting here reading this letter right now. The year 2060 may not have existed if we did not take action. We were at a peak in 2020 of destroying our planet and I am so glad that we were able to shift to better lifestyles. Not only did this save our planet, but it saved ourselves and our children as well. We would have been extremely selfish if we did not make a change when we did because our children would have been the ones dealing with it right now. 
                      <br><br>
Anyways, I’m glad we were able to make the change that needed to happen and we are living a much happier and simple life right now. Thanks for taking the time to read this and continue to do better.

This class has given me so much information about the climate crisis. I never even thought of all the bad things that the United States has done to this world since I was born. Through middle school and high school, I thought we are privilege to have different kinds of food, drinks, and clothing. It became a norm to always have food available anywhere you go. Also having a normal size home with many rooms, air conditioners, bathrooms, and cars I thought was the norm and that should be my plan for a future home. Lastly, when I was little I thought that you had to have money in order to be happy and survive. 
                      <br><br>
With these three thoughts, I would never know that these all have drawbacks to the earth if I did not take this class. All the food, drinks, and clothing has caused bad effects on the earth. We have a lot of food here in the United States. We mostly have beef which is one of the main causes of the climate crisis. This was shocking to me of how much a cow emits into the atmosphere of the environment. Now I try to avoid eating beef because of how much impact it causes for the climate crisis. Also taking this class, I realize how bad we produce clothes here in America. We make other countries make clothing for low wages and use their resources. We also just keep getting more clothes and never stop which causes an increase in the production of clothes from third world countries. 
                      <br><br>
The second thought is about home emissions. This class has taught me that we do not need that much space and stuff in our houses in order to be happy. My house has many rooms and two bathrooms. We also have an air conditioner and a heater. Furthermore, we have a fridge. We then have 4 cars that are used by all my members of my family   All of these increases the emissions of electricity. I realized in this class that I can go into an apartment or co-housing in a city later on in the future to reduce my emissions. I feel that I will not need a car if I live in the city because there would be mass transit of bus and subway. I am also going to still use my skateboard and ride around the sidewalks. 
                      <br><br>
The last thought I had was that money is the key to life. I thought money was the only way to make you feel happy because the way it was portrayed by American culture. I felt that it was always getting the newest materials and gadgets in order to showcase how rich you are. It seemed like rich people are the ones that everyone looks up to and seems to be the happiest. But after this class, I realized there was more to happiness than just money. My happiness different from everyone else but now I found that I am happy when I see myself improve and make other people happy. Money could be a problem with your happiness if you do not make enough. But, once you reach a point, money can only give you a limit of happiness. the rest you have to find yourself, which America does not show you. 

                      <br><br>
These are the three main thoughts I had in this course and has inspired me to improve and help the world significantly. 
                      <br><br>
Thank you, Ken, for teaching me the truth about the climate crisis.

As I stand before you today I apologize. I apologize that I wasn’t more active in convincing people that our planet needed to be saved. I apologize that I didn’t advocate for more people to go vote. I wanted to try my best so you all could have a life where you wouldn’t be constantly stressed about the future but my generation sadly couldn’t do it, no matter how hard we tried. We wanted to make the world a better place so we tried becoming vegan, we used paper straws, we called out corporations for their unethical practices, and we went on as many protests as we could. Looking back now it seems like it wasn’t enough but in the moment we never knew it would ever get this bad. We always thought people would eventually come to their senses and maybe that's where we were wrong. 

                      <br><br>

We ultimately lived in a capitalist society and people were free to make their own choices and many never thought that it would get this bad. We fought against these corporations but they won. I apologize that you are stuck at the same place my generation was years ago. In 2020 we had the choice to vote for Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden, a radical or a moderate. And sadly many picked the moderate. Now as the 2060 election is around the corner much of your generation is sadly stuck in the same predicament that mine was. I am sorry that I have to repeat what many generations before me said, “I hope you can learn from our mistakes”. 
                      <br><br>


Although many people have made small changes in their lives which in turn have made impacts on the environment. Bike infrastructure across the US has improved and our public transportation systems has become one of the best in the world. These changes are something my generation fought for but the corporations won again. Our small steps for change could not do much when fracking continued and the beef industry thrived.

                      <br><br>

However one thing that I do want you guys to know is that your guys have us on your side. When my generation was fighting against climate change it was us against the world, but now it will be everyone against the few who aren’t letting change happen. Hopefully, you never have to be in my shoes saying these words to the next generation.

A message from the future:

                      <br><br>

Time of writing: 3/15/2074

                      <br><br>

Most of us who believed in the climate crisis could have predicted this. Sea levels have risen to a degree which has caused 60% of all coastal cities in the United States to forcibly evacuate. Many species have gone entirely extinct, especially. Natural disaster have devastated the caribbean islands causing them to close permanently to tourists. Air pollution has gotten so bad that a new market for bottled air has exploded. Some places in the world have received unimaginable amounts of rain that has transformed massive areas of land into new formed lakes. Never before seen weather is now common around the world. Snow in the desserts, drought in the jungles, floods in the mountains, tornados in the bay. The vital signs of our planet are shaky. 

                      <br><br>

For all the effort that my generation put in to save this planet, we did not do enough. The protests, the push for voting, all of the public figures who spoke up at award ceremonies, the trends in sustainable fashion and sustainable living, the diet fads, the movies and documentaries, and above all, the enormous amount of scientific research and collective data that pointed to this very same outcome. Many of us in my generation saw this coming, but unfortunately, too many people chose to ignore the severity of it all over conveniency. For a time, the future looked bright. After the spread of the Coronavirus, the world acknowledge the power of taking preventative action. There was a push for all the developed countries to act faster on impending issues. Climate change and healthcare became two big focus points for the citizens of the world. In America, The Green New Deal was soon implemented in 2021. The end of Donald Trump's presidency was celebrated and in retrospect, it was the presidency that propelled Americans to become more engaged in our democracy. We looked like we where making some very progressive moves. Unfortunately, the systems in place that perpetuated the trend of over consumption were deeper than we thought. Oil companies did not go down without a fight. The agricultural business also ramped up its advertisement and leveraged support through franchises that have ubiquitous establishments like McDonalds. People made this an issue about freedom rather than the existential threat to our species. 

                      <br><br>

When I was a freshman in college, back in 2020, I remember taking a class on the climate crisis with a professor by the name of Ken (I forget his last name now). Ken once spoke very honestly about his predictions on the future of our planet. He said that he held on to the hope that in the 11th hour, humanity would realize its mistake and fight back climate change with everything that its got. Well, if you're reading this, it's not too late. It seems as though we are a quarter till that 11th hour. 
                      <br><br>


Back in 2060 we made the biggest push in renewable energy technology. Electric cars became more affordable and tax payer money was put into rebuilding big city infrastructure to accommodate for more bicyclists than ever before. Public transportation and biking were incentivized by giving everyone who uses alternatives to gasoline an increase in their tax returns. Large generators with the power to clean the air pollution are federally mandated throughout major cities across the world. Plans to plant more trees in each country annually have been implemented. The invention of completely electric commercial airplanes have also reduced carbon emissions dramatically. The mass production of FDA approved synthetic meat has taken over the market. True meat is a rarity in upscale restaurants often discouraged for its inhumane practices. Fashion and personal technology has slowed down its production and increased in value as well as quality. With the frequency of natural disasters that destroy homes and cities, architectural designs for housing have scaled down to prevent the loss of land and materials. 

                      <br><br>

Have we realized our mistakes? Yes. Did we do everything we could to stop climate change? No. Will we ever go back to how things where? Only time will tell. As far as I know, the future of my great-grandkids will be a difficult one. But they will have something that we never truly had. An intrinsic compassion for Earth. I am not simply talking about the wishful thinking that we all believed to be a genuine interests in fighting climate change. I mean a serious devotion to the betterment of this planet. Because the truth of the matter is, they don't have any other choice.

To my future self:                       <br><br>

Right now, it’s 2020. We are in a very critical moment in climate history, as we must act NOW before the damage is irreversible and too catastrophic to even try to fix. Yet, there are still people who have the audacity to deny its existence. Misinformed, brainwashed Americans like to pretend there isn’t enough money, or that change is too radical to help the climate crisis, as shown by those who think the Green New Deal is impractical. However, this COVID-19 crisis is showing that that is false, as the Fed is literally able to pull as much as $1.5 TRILLION dollars out of thin air to help businesses (not businesses, not people.) There is enough money to solve just about any problem in the world. And COVID-19 has demonstrated that. It has also demonstrated the consequences of our capitalist society in numerous ways. Hopefully, that will mean that more people in the future are aware of the disaster that is capitalism. That is crucial to the issue of climate change, as it has been made far more terrible with the greed and consumerism that comes with capitalism. 
                      <br><br>

I hope in the future that I am still trying to inform everyone in my sphere of influence about climate change and the measures we can take to help the issue. I hope that I still have a climate friendly diet and that I have significantly cut down on buying clothes because to be honest, I still have that problem. But to be honest, unless we do something immediately and before we see the symptoms of climate change. With what I’ve seen with COVID-19 in the US, much of the US acted very very late. The same will probably happen with climate change because the people in power and with money  don’t care about anything but their pockets. I hope in the future that some global anti-capitalist revolution will occur, although that is unlikely, because no amount of neoliberal capitalist reforms will fix the mess we made of the planet. I realize this is very pessimistic, and I hope dearly that I am wrong.

 Earlier today I overheard my husband and my kids were planning out a birthday surprise for me. They wanted to take me on a pedaling trip, which is an activity kids born last decade became enthusiastic about, out to the lake about ten miles away from our house located in the city. Kids these years are completely different from my generation when we were still teenagers. They love old things, thrifting and stuff. Bicycling is a trend now, while almost no kid's interested in saving a huge amount of money for a car of their own. I remember our time when young people were crazy about buying the latest clothes introduced to the market by Zara and H&M— it took me a while to recall their names as they no longer exist, and I haven’t heard of any fast fashion brands in quite a few years. I kind of look forward to our pedaling trip, because I know that we might stop somewhere in the middle of pedaling and find a nice meadow or a hill to have a random picnic. That’s something you can’t do if you’re driving a car, isn’t it? When I was young, I had to spend twenty minutes to find a parking space no matter where I went, so a random stop like this was impossible. Everyone is rushing to their destination and what’s the fun in that? 
                      <br><br>


My daughter won the second place of the vegetarian cooking competition yesterday and I was so proud of her. She has been passionate for vegan cooking for some time now, and everyone in our family has been supportive for her by agreeing to try the food she cooks experimentally. She was good at it, I’ll have to admit, so I haven’t been in the kitchen for quite a while. Sometimes my husband and I still miss the taste of beef, but we would just get the vegan beef from the supermarket and let our daughter experiment with that instead of real beef. We also have been buying only vegetables ever since she became interested in vegan cooking. In fact, we buy food less frequently. In the past ten years, we started to grow vegetables like carrots, lettuce, and potatoes in the rooftop garden, developed by the construction team when we moved into this co-housing community. Initially I was worried that growing food by ourselves might bring more work, but instead I fell in love with going up to the rooftop and feeling surrounded by nature although we live in a busy city hub. We don’t plant much, but there’s a weekly food sharing event in our neighborhood, where everyone in the community would take some of the food grown by themselves and come together to exchange, not with money but simply with the food itself. My daughter loves this event not just because she met her boyfriend during the event but also she got a lot of food ingredients for her experimental vegan cooking. 
                      <br><br>

Not until now I haven’t noticed that I wrote so much changes happened to our lifestyle in these decades. People’s lifestyles now are much greener. Although everyone’s living pace is still very busy and fast like when I was young, commuting to work, staying up late, taking up huge social and financial burden, but I feel like people have been able to spend more time with people in general. For example, I will be able to stay with my family during the pedaling trip and hear my daughter to talk about the fun things she experienced during the cooking competition while we have a wonderful picnic by the lake. I’m also able to meet many friendly neighbors during the food exchange event. 
                      <br><br>


When I was concerning the climate change and climate activism when I was a college student, I was thinking about implementing technologies, methods to call on people to act, dangerous consequences, and changing policies. But what I did not expect to see and experience was that many innovations and cultural change will actually bettering human interactions.

To my kiddo in the future,
                      <br><br>

Hopefully since we made it to the year 2060 it means that everything my generation did to help mitigate the climate crisis is starting to pay off. I am writing to you because you are nearly 30 years old and about to make many big decisions, and believe it or not, those decisions that determine your life will also have a huge impact on the planet. Here are some of the big decisions I made in my 20’s that affected both me and the planet… 
                      <br><br>

 Starting in the beginning of my first year of college I decided to try a vegetarian diet. This not only made me feel healthier, but also reduced my carbon footprint significantly because of how many emissions livestock adds to the environment. After graduating college and spending four years biking around campus, I went home and instead of buying my first car, I upgraded my beach cruiser to an electric bike. Instead of ¼ of my emissions coming from cars like the average American, I was able to get to work and around town with my eco-friendly, super trendy e-bike. (okay not really trendy yet but it will be soon!) A few years later when I married your dad and we were shopping for our first family home, we chose a small one, full of love instead of excessive “stuff”. We probably could have afforded a larger home, so I’m sorry you and your sister had to share a room, but living closer together not only makes us closer as a family with less distractions, but also helps keep our climate footprint modest. We even chose to honeymoon in Santa Barbara, where we first met, instead of flying anywhere and doing pretty much the most damaging activity climate wise we could do. As you know, we have composted your entire life, avoided food waste, and only purchased necessities instead of wants. Even though your father and I made these decisions to help mitigate the climate crisis, it would have meant nothing if the rest of the country didn’t meet us halfway.
                      <br><br>

 In the 20’s, the Green New Deal was finally implemented. We made our way back into the Paris Agreement after we booted Trump out of the white house and this time, the nations actually acted on what they agreed on the first time. The government change did not come easy, however. We took part in countless climate strikes and marches. You actually attended your first march in a stroller before you were even one year old, so you should also be proud to be part of the movement. We rallied together and got citizens to do their most important job… vote! My generation broke records for turning out to vote in the 2020 election and then kept it up every year after that. We voted for the candidates that cared about the crisis and then supported them as they implemented these changes. We used twitter and all social media to our advantage, sharing information and gathering more and more support. Schools from kindergarten up to college started teaching real climate change curriculum, which is why your generation is the most overall educated and informed on it. Let’s hope you will turn all the knowledge into positive action and continue what we have worked for the last 40 years. My favorite line from my freshman year climate crisis class was that “knowledge without action is power squandered”, so don’t squander it, kid!
                      <br><br>

 It is all up to you guys. The generations before me dug us into a really deep hole due to their negligence, denial, and continued destructive behaviors. The last 40 years, we finally rallied enough of the public together to fight for change, and we have actually seen it. It is now in your hands, although of course we will continue to support. Will you continue with what we started, and mitigate the climate crisis even more to make our earth liveable for many generations after yours? Or will all of our hard work be for nothing if you go back to natural ways of choosing that “American Dream” over the sustainability of our planet? I will still be here to guide you towards the first option, but clearly it is about both personal choices and public consensus, so you’ll need to get your friends on board too, and your future children, who will be here sooner than we know it. I lived my life with them in mind, so hopefully your generation will do the same. Make your knowledge powerful and make us proud.
                      <br><br>

A bit of a side note before I get to my real commentis that when I watched AOC’s message from future, I found myself disliking it because to me it felt like an unrealistic super radical for lack of a better word, “liberal” dream. Let me try to explain why I felt this way. As someone who is fascinated in 20th century history, (mostly pre-cold war) I really like understanding how societies function, for example the spread/power of ideas in a population, how governments rise and fall and things like that. In terms of the United States, progressive reform (post second industrial revolution) first happened in the Progressive Era (notably the election of 1912, and to save time and skip all the details the movement ran out of steam by the election of 1918 and switched the polar opposite, a government run by private industry during the roaring twenties which led to the 1929 stock market crash. Only in the wake of such unprecedented disaster could something as radical as the New Deal have come about, which created things like Social Security and massive government employment programs for the first time. Actually relatively quickly this “movement” of reform ended as well as by the end of the decade the conservative southern democrats became reluctant for more change. Fast forwarding to what became the next big “crisis” which was the 60s. Unfortunately this probably the topic I know least about, but I see that while this movement did succeed in creating some (though I’d argue not enough) social change, it had also really ended in the 1968 with Nixon’s “silent majority”  in which he promised a return to normalcy. It still wasn’t this that caused governmental change however, because what managed to do that instead was the stagflation crisis of the 70s. This led to people to turn to the new (or I’d argue rather old) policy of the Reagan Administration who boosted the Republican party back to prominence (which I’d argue they have had ever since) and all of the economic policies that (I’d argue) have been terrible for the nation, like trickle down economics leading to the massive wealth gap between rich and poor that we have today and their increasing power. I unfortunately also know little about the Obama administration, but from what I understand the 2008 is sort of an exception to the Republican Party makes the economy soar till it crashes and the Democrats take over trend because this time through the work of shady organizations like Donor’s Trust, have increasingly polarized the nation and led to the ultra-conservative conspiracy that we know as widespread climate denial. 
                      <br><br>

I got a bit carried away with that explanation. My point is conservatism has always reigned supreme in this country in reality, and even a democratic rally like a (new) New Deal would end up being undercut and not go far enough (like how the real new deal actually failed to fix the economy, as it was only ww2 that boosted government intervention in the economy far enough to to fix it). Anyway here is my message from the future:
                      <br><br>

In the wake of the second world war, the United States faced a problem, the horrors of the great depression still fresh in the minds of the Truman Administration, and they needed to ensure that the massive industrial machine that won the war, the US economy, kept churning to keep the depression from returning. To do this they made a single decision that would change everything, endorse the hyperconsumption of consumable goods. This came in many forms, one good example being the turning tank and plane factories into automobile factories, and championing the car as the best transportation method. At first this seemed like an ingenious move for both the United States domestically and abroad. The United States economy transitioned into the consumer powerhouse of the world, while at the same time using its influence in things like the Marshall Plan to spread the American consumer economy across the world, economically the Soviet Union was hopeless in comparison. Starting as early as the 1950s, scientists warned that mass consumerism would lead to disastrous global warming and pollution; however, people looked the other way during a time of such unprecedented economic success. By the 1970s however, the United States’s production economy was rivaled by the new worldwide consumer economies it had created worldwide and the American worker suffered as production moved out of the country. The decade was also plagued by economic strife, as lack of oil to fuel the American economic machine led to high inflation and unemployment. People questioned whether oil was really what America should depend on, and Jimmy Carter even put solar panels on the white house roof to show support for clean energy. However, this sort of mindset was not what the next president’s Administration, the Reagan Administration had in mind, they managed to restore American economic success, in part by shifting the economy more toward services and finances than production, but also with policies such as the trickle down economics, which saw financial success, but did so by setting up a system that would increase the wealth gap in the long term. Having restored the economy to normal however, the Reagan administration was happy to ignore the long term social effects of its policies. 
                      <br><br>

By the 2000s however the calls to save the environment were growing louder, although the environmentalist Al Gore lost the election of 2000, a few years later he released the film An Inconvenient Truth, to spread the message about the danger of climate change. The next democratic administration, the Obama Administration, then put forward some of the first federal policies to combat climate change in the United States, such as massive subsidies for green energy. It would be an understatement to say that the Republicans of the time disliked government meddling in the economy for climate change. In response to the liberal policies of the Obama administration, ultra-conservative think tanks came up with a massive conspiracy to convince the public that climate change was a hoax. In just a few short years, massive public misinformation and concussion had left all the momentum that had led to Obama’s climate change policies dead by the 2016 election, then by a fluke of the electoral system the Republican candidate Donald Trump, widely expected to lose, won the presidency of the United States. Trump’s official stance on climate change was that it was a hoax and didn’t exist, and under his administration the federal government saw a dismantling and mismanagement more than any recent president before him. Being a self proclaimed businessman, the one issue that Trump cared more about than anything was the state of the economy, which unsurprisingly under him saw massive growth not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis. However, as signs of climate change became more and more apparent and social injustice grew even more he continued to look the other way. His presidency was also notable for the rise of China as another world superpower after his ineffective “Trade Deal” to combat their solid worldwide stranglehold of cheap labor and products, and the 2020 Whuhan Coronavirus pandemic. It would of course the contravirus epidemic that brought the worldwide economy to a standstill, and that being Trump’s one claim to fame, saw him voted out of office in 2020 as the virus raged across the country.
                      <br><br>

At this point one would expect that the US would finally deal with climate change and that the crisis as a whole would be avoided, but we both know that’s not how the story goes. The Biden Administration was plagued by bouts of incomplete and missteps as the favorite Republican nickname for him stuck, “Sleepy Joe Biden.” In addition to the long grind of attempting to bring the economy out of recession, Climate Change was one of the last topics Biden wished to tackle, other then a few half hearted attempts for funding renewables. The Donor's Trust disinformation campaign continued strong, and any attempt to reach necessary bipartisan agreement to tackle the crisis was all but nullified. The republicans again won the presidential elections of 2024 and 2032, but as with the republican presidents of the 1920s their accomplishments were few expect for championing the economy and “free trade,” the later of which continued to turn farther and farther against the US as India surpassed the US’s GDP, just as China had a decade earlier.

By the early 2030’s though all of the climate disasters reached a tipping point. As sea levels rose, new and larger tornadoes and hurricanes soared, and as coastal fish went extinct, it was clear that humanity had entered a new era, an era of suffering and misery at the ends of an inhospitable climate. We were able to change since then, not like the climate is much better, but humans have always been as stubborn as we have been adaptable. The story of Climate Change will continued to be remembered by our children and grandchildren as the great folly of the 21st century as they slowly nurture the planet back to being hospitable, as it originally was.

<p>
To my children:
                      <br><br>

The year 2060, I am 59 years old. It seems like it was only yesterday that I was in college learning about the climate crisis. However, that was 40 years ago and a lot has changed since then. We are finally living a sustainable lifestyle and helping the earth prosper. However, this did take a lot of hard work. Back in 2020 when I was in college we were learning a lot about how much our world was trying to adapt all the harmful things we were doing to it. While learning about the climate crisis, natural disasters were occurring in our backyard. Wildfires, hurricanes, and sea level rise were just some of the few things the population at the time ignored.  We were in fact harming the world and these natural disasters were ways that the world was asking for help. I was only 17 and in high school when the Thomas Fire had school cancelled because of unsafe air conditions. Two years later when I was in college another fire began fall quarter of my sophomore year. 
                      <br><br>

Although these were stressful times filled with gray skies, we were able to continue with our daily lives after the fires were put out. Many of us were furious that people who held positions of power were not doing anything. Many different movements began to advocate for change and what we now know as the Green New Deal was trying to get adopted at the time. Yes, it's been since before I was in college that this was trying to get adopted. As you have read in textbooks, our president at the time, Trump, did not care about climate change and removed us from the Paris Agreement. This agreement aimed to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2. However this was not achieved and the U.S. continued to take advantage of fossil fuels. 
                      <br><br>

A lot of things have changed since my time. Kids back then used to believe that their happiness came from expensive material things. The newest iPhone, playstations, laptops, clothing, and cars were what people were always trying to buy. People used to work extremely long hours to be able to achieve their American Dream. These same people who worked extremely hard to provide for their family were the same people who contributed to the increase of greenhouse gases and didn’t find an issue with doing so until they were directly affected by one of earth's cries. Luckily this materialistic phase has faded and we no longer rely on material possessions for our happiness. We don’t take nature for granted and respect it. 
                      <br><br>

Now that we finally have someone who cares about the future of our country and its people as president we are living a different life than I once did. Thanks to the education many of us received, not only at UCSB, but all around the world we were able to make a change for the better. Although we could have acted way sooner, not enough of us cared enough to listen and act at the time but I glad things turned out okay, not just for me to enjoy but for you guys. Please remember to be kind to others and to think about the consequences that your actions have.

Dear Jimmy from 2020,                       <br><br>

It is 2060, I am living in a one bedroom apartment in Malibu. Football is long gone, baseball is somehow still relevant and the planet’s population is dwindling by the day. I sit here, a retired film director who cannot go back to Malibu house I lived in throughout my career because it burned down years ago in what was the worst wildfire of the 2040s. Due to faulty insurance and terrible ex-wife I lost that land and my dreams of living and dying in the hills are long gone. 
                      <br><br>
I wish I could tell you everything is going to be ok, I wish I could tell you that you saved your son in that fire. I wish I could tell you that your last film didn’t lose millions for your production company, but it did. I believe the perils in my life could have been solved if I took the incoming assault of climate change more seriously. I lived a fruitful 20s and 30’s, however the climate got worse and C02 continued to rise. Even though your film career was taking off, you should have paid more attention to what was going on around you. How you could of used your platform to save the world. Instead, I sit here in a one bedroom apartment in Anaheim. I might go to the Angel’s game just to bake in the one hundred ten degree august heat. 
                      <br><br>
How did we let it get like this? It all happened in the late 2020’s. The country was actually doing well, and looking towards a promising future AOC was about to be elected president until she was assassinated by an unknown assailant. The case is still cold to this day. Instead, Donald Trump Jr won the 2028 election and sent our nation down a dark path. We never quite adapted the green new deal. 
                      <br><br>
I look back on this time of my life, all I wanted to do was make movies and retire in Malibu. Instead I sit here sweating in my air conditonless Orange County apartment writing residual checks to my ex wife who lives in the valley with a celebrity chef. Though my passion for film is still strong, I do not see myself ever getting out of this hole. 
                      <br><br>
Do yourself a favor and take a moment to look at yourself now and think what you can do to change the worlds path so you don’t end up alone in a one bedroom apartment in anaheim while your ex wife eats surf n turf in a woodland hills mansion.

<p>
The year is currently 2020 and I am in my second year of college. The Corona Virus has made its way to the United States and the campuses all across the nation have transitioned online because of the need to limit the spread of disease. I am going to go home and will not return until Fall quarter because Spring quarter has been canceled by Chancellor Yang until further notice. Most of my friends are also going home and yet, I feel like I should stay at school because of the possibility of what my future would look like if I stayed behind. Despite COVID-19 being the main topic of discussion all throughout the world, the climate is still warming and changing.

                      <br><br>

The 2020 presidential election is coming up in November and Bernie Sanders has won the Democratic Nomination and wins the presidency. The Democrats are able to take back the Senate from the Republicans. Sanders' first act as president is rolling out with AOC’s Green New Deal, which calls for the change of the United States economy and society changing the country forever with the support of the house and senate. With the Green New Deal enacted, we see the transition of fossil fuels as energy sources being removed and the country using renewable sources such as solar panels and wind turbines. The country also begins to shift to providing more social programs such as universal healthcare, free college for all, and creating high paying jobs that are going to all people in the United States. Those that had been historically unable to have access to opportunities are now the ones having access to them. We see a drastic decrease in our military spending meaning our United States is no longer having military bases all throughout the world.
                      <br><br>


When I was in college, I was hoping for this change because it was necessary for our entire species. I am upset that it had taken this long for the action to finally be taken. I decided that I would join my local Sunrise movement and EcoVista when I would return to do action in my own community because it had to start somewhere. Going back home, I would continue to do what I could such as creating a YouTube channel that would not only talk about what I would do for fun but educate those that were uncertain about what Climate Change was. 

                      <br><br>

To my students reading my comment from the past, I want you guys to know that this was a real issue and though we took the necessary steps to halt a greater catastrophe. It will not be several years before we can get our planet back to a level that is natural. To my students, I hope nothing else that would lead to the end of the human race to arise in your lifetime and if something does, know that you do have the power to demand change.

<p>

 I hope you are doing well and college is treating you well. I know college can get hard, but do not worry because you made it. All your hard work has paid off and thanks to your loved ones, mom, and dad, you accomplished your dreams. As you might be wondering, I am writing to you because even though you have always been pretty optimistic I want you to know that the world is going to be fine. People came together and their power and team work had success in the 2020 presidential elections; the democrats took back the white house and the senate. While you might be wondering, President Sanders initiated the Green New Deal project and it has been going on ever since. It was a huge accomplishment and it has been beneficial for many people. However, the plan did take longer than expected and sadly many of the cities and communities along the shore had to evacuate due to the floods, Miami being one of them. Although many people had to immigrate, the US governors had prepared for the rapid migration and those who had to move were provided with housing and jobs. Similarly, the American culture was forced to change its lifestyle and daily practices. The Carbon Tax was passed, thus the products related to high carbon emissions became more expensive. Nonetheless, people were patient and adapted to new prices and taxes. Prior to these changes, people were skeptical but after the floods in Miami, the government and most of the United States realize the actual importance of climate change and its effect on the whole world. 

                      <br><br>

Also, the Paris agreement was revised and updated, more countries have joined the climate movement and are still working on renewable clean sources of energy. The limit for earth warming, as of now, is 2.2℃. In addition, almost all the sweatshops have been banned, and even though many factories are still producing and manufacturing their products outside of the United States, there are now laws that enforce big companies and industries to follow the same guidelines outside of the country. They must follow certain safety and fair standards for the workers no matter where they are located. 

                      <br><br>

Moreover, I can assure you that it is worth to switch to a plant-based diet. I remember that around this time you were trying to be vegetarian, and I can tell you that it has been one of the best decisions you have taken. I know it was hard when visiting mom and dad in Mexico and you had to restrain yourself from eating meat, but I am grateful you did and so is your family. OH YEAH ! I forgot to mention, you did find your soulmate. He is amazing, and you have two beautiful and kind boys, I guess that psychic from Mexico was right about having two boys. They are so smart and creative (pretty sure they get it from mom), I am going a little off topic… but I want you to remember that everything happens for a reason and that no matter what you will make it through. As of now, enjoy partying and your friends, you are living your best life and be grateful for everything you have. Furthermore, I want to encourage you to become an activist, follow your desire to help others and use your privileges for the best. The summer between sophomore and junior year you became very involved with activism, but once you got into med school you quit. So, do not quit, you have so much to offer and never let anyone tell you otherwise. 

                      <br><br>

I wish you the best and can’t wait for you to experience life and see what the future holds for you

Dear future children,

                      <br><br>

Hello, It's your mother writing from the year 2060. I want to explain how cliamte change was affecting the world before we started to make a large change in our ways. I also want to explain what specific detrimental adjustments the world created to stop this crisis.
                      <br><br>


Climate change was one of the largest problems that our society was facing during my time. Temperatures were rising, polar ice caps were melting, hurricanes were becoming more intense, and forest fires were increasing and becoming more intense. Yet, even though all of these tragedies were occurring people were not making a detrimental change. People were still fracking at an immense degree and using fossil fuels for everyday life. The average amount of CO2 the average American was emitting was about 16 tons and it should have been at 2 tons per person. People were stuck in a materialistic mindset and this attributed to fast fashion. Fast fashion is attributed to horrible work environments for the workers creating these clothes and a large amount of waste. Waste is dumped into landfills and landfills sit and produce a large amount of methane.

                      <br><br>

Something had to be done. But what? People were not willing to change, Americans were one of the largest contributors to climate change and no one was making a large enough commitment to help the planet. Well I didn't give up and my generation didn't give up to save the planet. The generation before us created enough damage and we were there to clean up the mess. 

                      <br><br>

The first step to making a change was implementing a leader in charge that could implement climate change policies. We elected Bernie Sanders and he created a greener environment. The Green New Deal passed once he was elected in office. Within this deal a carbon tax was implemented. A carbon tax charges people a tax for how much fossil fuels one takes out of the ground. This started to make people become more cautious on how much fossil fuel they were fracking from the ground. Also a new idea that people have become very inclined to follow is meatless Monday. Every Monday people try and stray from meat to try and lower the meat industry. I personally have become vegetarian to try and help the environment as much as we can. We can always decide what we want to eat and our eating habits save the environment. Another great change was that public transportation was improved immensely. There are more trails for buses to follow and the interior of buses are cleaner making people more inclined to use this source of transportation. Public transportation is not just a source for the poor anymore, everyone uses it.

                      <br><br>

Speaking of better transportation, bikes are really big now. Bike routes are becoming safer and more useful than car tracks. People are biking which helps the environment and helps someone's fitness. By exercising from a bike ride, it helps people feel less stressed. Restaurants have created a new system to donate their leftovers to a food bank instead of just throwing the leftovers away in the trash and creating large landfills.

                      <br><br>

I hope you learned alot from these darlings. Always do what you can to help the planet and those around you. We wanted to help our future generation, I hope you do the same.


Love,                      <br><br>

March 2020

                      <br><br>

Today the COVID-19 pandemic is in effect, and I am writing this while the lockdowns are starting to take effect. There is no toilet paper anywhere. I think about how this virus has gotten everyone into a panic, which in part is justified; a new potentially fatal illness is worrisome. However, this has gotten me thinking of the public’s relatively quick response as compared to the climate change crisis. The answer is pretty simple: short terms versus long term repercussions. Considering what I know, the climate crisis still scares me more, even in self-quarantine. 
                      <br><br>


I want to imagine a future where everything has been taken care of: we fixed our transportation issue, emission levels have dropped significantly, people were not dislocated from rising sea levels, forests and jungles are growing, the ocean acidity levels dropped and coral reefs have not gone extinct, the meet industry is not as big, people have smaller families, less stuff is being bought and consumed. That is the future that I want to believe in.

                      <br><br>

By 2060 I will be my parents’ age. They are not climate deniers but are still not as concerned as I am. I want the year 2060 to be less turbulent than this one has, so that my children can look at me and say that I did something. I will eat more environmentally conscious, avoid needless travel, travel greener, and consume less. I will try to convince people to make similar changes. I want the names like Florida and Sri Lanka to instill pride in 2060 because we stopped the climbing sea levels from taking them under. 
                      <br><br>
There are many other problems today, like healthcare, wealth inequality, gun violence, and others. I hope they have been fixed too. I don’t want to read this letter in forty years and feel like I’ve done nothing to help. Even if I am reading this at 62 years of age and feel that way, I think there’s still a chance to do good.

Dear Future Self,
                      <br><br>

I’m currently writing this on the top bunk in the triple at San Cat. As of right now the world Is not looking too good at the moment. For one, back in 2016 Trump was elected president, causing a major setback on the advancements made for the environment and currently he’s not doing much for the Green New deal either. Last week we were able to vote for the first time in our lives and candidates like Bernie Sanders are highly favorable in this generation, because of his advocacy for environmental rights. For now, I can’t tell who will win this year’s election, but I pray it is Bernie because he seems like the only candidate who is willing to make a change for the future. I would hate to see world suffer and slowly die out because of the little importance it has based on our current president. In this year alone, we have recorded the highest global carbon emissions and temperatures, which have nearly melted most of Antarctica and Greenland’s ice resulting in the sea level rising.
                      <br><br>

In the year 2060, I hope to see new laws and regulations that establish a more sustainable environment for the future. I want endangered species to regain their populations back to a normal state and live a life where they will not be threatened by any human. Nonetheless, having not to worry about global warming or harmful emissions being released into the atmosphere will be amazing news for the whole world. It would have shown the growth and improvement from Bernie’s establishments and how he progressed the lives of millions of people because of his strong support for the environment My children will no longer have to face a world of disaster and instead live in a prosperous society where their children can be raised without ever having to here of threatening environmental dangers.

<p>
As it is now the year 2060, I often look back and ponder the days when the climate crisis was in its infancy.  Looking back a whole 40 years ago in the year 2020, I can’t help but feel both proud and frustrated at the same time.  To start, I must be proud of myself for the actions that I took as a freshman in college at UCSB.  Before coming to college, I remember knowing very little about the climate crisis or the severity of the issue as a whole.  I was more concerned with other things in my life and was not given the great opportunities I had at UCSB to actually learn about global warming.  However, once I entered college and took my first English class with Professor Ken Hiltner, my perspective on practically everything changed forever.  In just a short, ten week quarter, I felt Ken taught me more about the possibilities of my future and the fate of the world than any other teacher or professor I had in the past.  I am proud that I was prompted to take this course and proud of the actions I took after learning about all of the things that I did.  As a result of taking this course, I switched to almost an entirely plant based diet.  Having been a vegetarian almost 4 years prior to taking the course, I wanted to take my diet even further and reduce the amount of waste that is the direct result from my individual diet.  This, looking back, is something I am definitely proud of.  In addition, I am also very proud of the way I built such a strong consciousness regarding where my clothing and other materials that I buy are sourced from.  Looking back, I am proud of the consciousness that I had at such a young age regarding the materials that I use and the injustices that many countries face as a result of America’s consumer capitalism.  Finally, I am probably most proud of my past-18-year-old self for exercising my rights by voting for a candidate that I felt would most effectively address the climate crisis.  I remember the voting day in early March of my freshman year at UCSB.  As many of my friends and fellow peers were going to the polls and carrying out their civic duty, there were still many people I found refusing to vote or even become more informed.  I remember feeling a sense of lost hope and disappointment for the people that were not exercising their rights.  However, I still knew that I could make a difference by doing my part and voting.  I often would update myself on current politics, not just because I was a Political Science major but because the class with Professor Hiltner truly inspired me to be even more informed.  

                      <br><br>

The frustration I felt at the time usually centered around the climate change deniers that I knew were present throughout the world.  Once again, I was really unaware that there was such a strong force denying the climate crisis and even aiming to falsify it.  At the time, I thought that a majority, if not all people, would believe in the climate crisis in the year 2020.  However, I was wrong, as Ken’s class informed me that there are still a great amount of people that feel we are not in a state of catastrophic global warming.  Looking back on Ken’s class, I remembered watching a video from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes titled “A Message From the Future.”  AOC, a popular yet controversial figure still today, wrote about the injustices that surrounded the climate crisis in the present year.  She explained how huge oil companies and think tanks were doing everything in their power to lessen public concern around the climate crisis and falsify it entirely.  Even though this was a surprise at the time, AOC and many other politicians that were passionate about the climate crisis helped to raise awareness surrounding the catastrophes that resulted from global warming.  They even pressed to pass a new legislation that would center around finding solutions to climate change called the Green New Deal.  AOC and other climate- change-believing-politicians' ideas were ahead of their time, and truly are the cause to the new legislations that are in place today.  My generation is also to thank for helping to mitigate the climate crisis, as they are one of the first to be so vocal about it and spearhead movements surrounding the mitigation of the climate crisis.  Looking both to the past and the future, I hope that all generations can learn from this period of time where there was such a great urgency to save our one and only home: planet Earth.

To the kids i may never have, 
                      <br><br>


For most of my childhood, climate change was not something i considered very often. Back then it had many names: global warming, the climate crisis, global climate change, etc; and had a very vague definition. Back then no one could agree on what the climate crisis was, who had caused it, and what the consequences would be. Back then no one was in a rush to solve the problem, the public was confused, and action was slow. All that changed my second year of uni at UCSB. Tensions in the united states, and globally for that matter, were very high. The tension surrounding climate change was at an all time high as the rest of the world waited to see if the US would finally acknowledge its role in the climate pandemic and reflect said acknowledgment in the 2020 elections. I made sure to do my part, to vote, to caution others against the danger of climate change, to reduce my use of fossil fuels, meet products, and surplus goods. Ultimately, it was not enough. Trump was reelected in November of 2020, no legislation was put in place to reduce the united states carbon foot print, no policies were put in place to address the meet industry, and consumerism continued to ravenge the american public. Despite myself and most of my generation doing our part to address this monumental issue head on, one generation was not enough to thwart climate change. I hope this doesn't come to pass. I hope I am wrong. I will do my part, I hope that the older generations do theirs as well.

Dear Future Me:                      <br><br>

 You knew. You knew what would happen, yet you did nothing to stop it.
                      <br><br>

 Was your carnivorous diet worth this living hell on Earth? Were the 2 minute car rides so meaningful now that the roads are barren and constantly struck with brush fires? Are the clothes you order everyday from fast fashion shops doing well now that you donated them to Goodwill? Are you happy knowing that you contributed to the downfall of your future? It is safe to say that you can’t complain because you are part of the reason why. You could have done so much more by simply doing so much less… and yet, here we are. At the end.
                      <br><br>

It is much easier said than done. Forty years ago, you were stubborn (and still am). You started college, and during your second quarter, you decided to take a climate crisis class without even knowing what you’re getting yourself into. You didn’t know that everything you were doing everyday had a negative impact on not only a countless number of people across the world, but also to the very planet you live on. From eating a strictly carnivorous diet (with the exception of mushrooms and carrots here and there) to doing absolutely everything possible to raise your climate footprint simply because it was easier and less work, I bet you wish you could redo everything differently. Maybe you would have eaten at DLG when they decided to do Green Mondays rather than Ortega because they had roast beef. Maybe you would have left your car at home and used your bike to get to campus instead of spending almost $1000 on a parking pass. Maybe we wouldn’t be here wishing we did something sooner.
                      <br><br>

2020 already seemed so fake. It was a year of sadness and loss, of an almost world war because of twitter, and a year of epidemic– and this was only the first three months. Bernie Sanders was almost president and yet again this country let him slip through our very hands for the same inhumane nutcase who led us to our ultimate downfall. You thought 2016 was bad? Just wait until this year is done. If only we got out and did the one very thing that could have changed the direction of our future for the better: vote. This was your first year being able to vote, and you were so excited that you were able to make a change. Your environment kept you hopeful that maybe, just maybe, this is the year that it would finally happen. Our world would be saved, everyone would have free healthcare and education, and there wouldn’t be kids in cages. Here is where we went wrong again. Social media took over so much that we believed voting was the same as pressing retweet on a Bernie tweet. We thought that simply showing our support online rather than in the polling place was enough. This was the ultimate f*ck up. We believed so much in others that we put our faith into them when we had the ability to change it when it was most needed. It was not only wrong to think this, but embarrassing to look back upon because we. had. It. We just didn’t have enough faith.
                      <br><br>

Oh, how I wish you understood how dreadful Forever 21 and Ulta was for you. You wore makeup every 5 months and yet you still had the urge to click order everyday! What was wrong with you? If you had realized just how much it hurt the planet as much it hurt your bank account, we wouldn’t be living in a wasteland with no money. Consumerism took over your whole life and that is where it went wrong. You didn’t need that pink half zip because you don’t even wear pink or like half zips. You didn’t need that $60 pair of jeans because everytime you put jeans on you take them off within the hour because you can’t stand the feeling of wearing them. If only you and others stopped, maybe millions of people who are enslaved with the job of making your clothes that collect dust would still be here today and not 10 feet under.
                      <br><br>

 I wish you could see what I’m seeing right now. It would have changed everything.
                      <br><br>

 You always believed that you, a 4’11 90 lb woman, didn't have the means to make a difference. Everyone else was going to, so why should you? What was me eating a steak and buying a couple of shirts going to do when everyone else already stopped? The one thing I want to tell you is that you were incredibly naive and stupid. You held the world at your fingertips and dropped the ball so hard that you are literally living upside down. If only you had become freegan or decided against driving, you’d have your PhD and be a professor like you’d always hoped and dreamed. But no, you are sitting here waiting for the end because that is what you paved your life to be. There is no going back now. I hope you were happy. Cause I sure am not.
                      <br><br>

A message from the future: 
                      <br><br>

The year 2020 has been a year of disasters, from global warming to the melting of glaciers to the subsequent wildfires, showing that the climate is getting worse. Coupled with the recent global spread of the coronavirus, although climate is not the main cause, I believe that the weather must have played a role. Prehistoric plagues trapped in the melting ice have wreaked havoc on the world and viruses mutate with the changing climate. All tying back to the same issue-- "alarming levels of inaction". We did not do enough, even when we not only knew what was causing the climate crisis but we also knew exactly what we needed to do to stop it.
                      <br><br>

We are suffering the consequences. If we continue to do nothing, our future will see many species going extinct, sea levels rising and forests and islands disappearing. The consequences are so dire that there is no turning back. But now we have a chance to change the future. Despite the reluctance of many to acknowledge climate change, governments have avoided talking about it, and businesses have blocked environmental improvements in order to get more out of it. But we can start with ourselves and gradually change our way of life to be greener. If we all stick to a sustainable lifestyle, the impact will be huge. We can replace cars with bicycles, eat less high-emission meat, vote for the green New Deal, and I believe the world will be a better place if we combine the efforts of all of us.
                      <br><br>

I know that 2020 is not a good year, but it is also an extraordinary year, because we are going to change ourselves from this year, not to 2021, to repeat the mistakes of a generation ago, to save as many species as we can. We have to do it, and we have to do it well, and we have to do it well, and we have to make an impact, and we have to shame the people who are against green. Let them know that the trend is unstoppable. What the future will become is in the hands of our generation.

Dear Future Self, 
                      <br><br>

	When you wrote this you had just finished taking a course that changed your perspective of how you wanted to live life in the future. Before taking this class you desired a life full of riches, traveling, nice cars, big homes, and many things. In other words, a successful life in the eyes of the American society. After taking this class, I realized how much this lifestyle would affect the future generations and our planet.
                      <br><br>

	I really hope that this realization stuck with you throughout all these 40 years that have passed. I also hope you took the knowledge that you gained from this class and shared it with others. I really hope that you were able to make huge changes that are hard for me to make right now. One being giving up meat and transitioning to a plant based diet. As I write this letter, I am having trouble giving up meat completely, but I am trying. I hope that you have been successful with this. 
                      <br><br>

	I am currently writing this letter full of fear and worry for our future. I hope that not only you have tried to change your life for the better of the planet, I hope the rest of the world has as well. The reason I am full of fear and worry is because I am not sure that the whole world can change and pull through, and that is what we need to combat the climate crisis. I hope the world was able to pull through and do their best. I hope that you are living in a safe and healthy planet.

It’s 2060, trees rustled as I sat on my balcony under shades casted by the slanted roof. I picked up my guitar and gazed across the meadow under the bright sunlight. Humming and strumming a few chords, only the acoustic sounds echo in this timeless land. Extreme weather events wiped out a third of the human habitats that once stand 40 years ago globally. Megacities I grew up in no long exist, and instead the midwest saw prosperity as people take refuge from sea level rise. What happened? I reflected on what I did and what we all did. The Green New Deal was passed along with other environmental-focused measures taken to minimize the impacts of climate change to humanity. It was significant, but it was simply a bit late. 
                      <br><br>


40 years ago, in the winter of year 2020, I was challenged to re-think the priority in my life: what’s really important to me personally and what I think is important to me. A course named English 23: The Climate Crisis was the catalyst. It widened my horizons and alarmed me about the state of the issue. Different from any type of classes that intended to focus on the scientific and technical sides of climate change, this class explored different approaches and looked into social phenomenons contributing to climate change in the hopes of resolving the issues on a fundamental level: encouraging cultural shifts and setting new trends so people could be accustomed to live sustainably for all the lives on this planet. It made me very self-conscious about the decisions I make everyday; as a result, my personal consumption of beef was significantly reduced. 
                      <br><br>


Green New Deal was introduced in 2019, however, the scale of change and efforts it presented and needed simply were too hard to be met by an economy that heavily favors self-interests. 

                      <br><br>

By the year of 2030, people started to recognize the real consequences of climate change as major cities in the world are struck with pandemics and extreme weather events. Differences were put aside and people searched for solutions and this is when we saw the progress of the Green New Deal. Politicians that advocated for environmental policies were elected. The American economy that previously relied on fossil fuels slowly transformed into one that is built upon renewable energy. I was part of this political movement where 90% of Americans voted for candidates that put climate change as one of their priorities. In additional to collective change, people also took up the challenge of ensuring their lifestyles are sustainable in the first place and solar panels were installed on a massive scales in majority of the household. 

                      <br><br>

Fast forward 20 years, America has cut out its emission entirely as a result of the accomplishment of the Green New Deal. A new industry of renewable energy was created. However, as the residual warming effect from the ocean continued and more natural disasters occurred, half of the population in those areas affected were lost and people were forced relocated to different parts of the world. Sea-level rise flooded costal cities and islands around the world. This served as a harsh lesson for us and our children, but part of me was glad as it was better to act late than never. I took initiatives and contributed to establish a network of organizations that focus on assisting climate refugees as I was too affected by it.  
                      <br><br>


In 2060, warming returned to 2020 levels as geoengineering techniques were implemented and people adopted to extremely sustainable lifestyles. Following the footsteps of the United States, almost all of the developed countries have also reached net zero carbon emission and developing countries are receiving technological and financial aids from developed countries as compensation for climate injustice they faced previously. We solved the problem laid by our previous generation, but with a cost of many innocent lives that were taken away. To our generation, it is always going to be a weight that we will have to carry.

It's been 40 years since 2020, the year humanity finally paid for its collective sins. The year started off a shitshow with the threat of large scale military interventions taken under the name of then-President Trump, the pathetic excuse we had for an American president. Following the de-escalation of the conflict, our world was thrown into turmoil once the coronavirus reared its ugly head, from China to Italy to our home in the U.S we battled this disease until our people, industry, government, and economy lay in ruins rebuilding after losing so many people proved impossible as the 'boomers' who built our nations set their time bomb to go off when we were weakest. The impacts of climate change decimated our ability to rebuild our struggling societies. The next 20 years saw widespread famine, plague, and war as we fought over nothing, the loss of so much to an unseen disease drove us mad and the earth wept for the blood we spilled. 
                      <br><br>


After the balkanization of almost every major power and hundreds of millions dead, our wasteful societies were on the verge of blinking out, but our climate forgave us I guess 20 years of almost no advancement, production, and culling of our populations gave our earth the time to heal, just as the black death allowed Europe to rise from its ashes so did the culmination of the wars, famines, plagues, and the natural disasters from climate change. We built a renewable society from the ashes of the old, and now at the age of 60 I can look at my past, I became a doctor after the virus drove up demand and it became easier to become a doctor, I watched as countless plagues ravaged our people, now my son you live in a world that bears these scars not as blemishes but as a motivation to leave cleanly, clean energy, clean environment, and most importantly a clean mind free of the toxic selfishness that destroyed our world.

<p>
To future generations:
                      <br><br>

2020 was, well, a wild year to say the very least. Lots of unpredictable factors made it basically a shit show at the beginning, but it smoothed out as the year went along. One factor, however, that stood out as a light in those first few chaotic months was an English course I took at UCSB called "Climate Crisis 101". Now, I'm not going to lie- I absolutely signed up for this class because it seemed like a much easier way to get rid of my literature requirement than a normal English class. However, this class actually taught me so much more than I ever could have anticipated, and it changed my perspective on many of the lifestyle choices that directly affect the exponential growth of climate change. 
                      <br><br>

My professor, Ken, had left us plenty of resources to begin making changes in our personal lives that helped combat our individual carbon footprints. I began slowly deferring away from meat products, (specifically red meat).I relied much more on public transport or just simply walking to get to and from places. I made informed political decisions for my first time-voting, allowing candidates who took strong measures to mitigate climate change to be elected into office during the 2020 election. Ken's class showed our generation what we needed to do, and how we could fix it. And boy did we ever.
                      <br><br>

In the time since then, we've managed to keep a stronghold on electing leaders and politicians who actively care about climate change, and who take necessary measures to mitigate as much of the harm we do on the planet as we possibly can. Thousands of miles of both land and sea have been protected as national preserves, sanctuaries, and parks. Personal vehicle usage is at its lowest of all time. Healthcare has become universal, and has allowed for women nationwide to make more informed and proactive choices when it comes to their careers, education, and families. Progressive leaders have developed and incorporated the Green Deal into our government, allowing for large-scale cutbacks on emission and greenhouse gases going into our environment. 
                      <br><br>

But it wasn't an easy battle to forge. Despite the overwhelming support for helping mitigate climate change at this point, it was a hotly divisive political issue (as you might know) in 2020, and it still is today. There are plenty of dissenters who STILL deny the effects of climate change. It is something you will have to learn to deal with. But that shouldn't stop you from trying to educate people properly on what climate change truly is. Show them Ken's videos; show them documentaries about how debilitating natural disasters were at this point in history; show them what commercial farming does to our ozone and air pollution levels. Show them what you can to educate them. For some, alarmist pieces might do the trick; for others, they might push them farther away from believing in climate change. There won't be one magic puzzle piece that'll do the trick. But, it will always come down to the perseverance of your generation to continue to expand on the progress that my generation made. I hope you make that choice.

future self,
                      <br><br>


The day is March Fifteenth Two-Thousand Twenty. I am currently a struggling, first-generation, first-year college student reflecting on the impact that English 23 (Climate Crisis 101) had on me. But first, let me provide a bit of background for the current situation. Breaking news at the moment: coronavirus (COVID-19) is making a dramatic impact globally; society is in panic, the media is and as far as twitter is concerned, you cannot scroll through the timeline without toilet paper memes popping up every 2 or three tweets. The world as we know it is in the middle of a transition to a lockdown, and people can't help but to stock up in preparation for the next couple months or weeks or till who knows when. Daddy Yang, (aka the chancellor) has announced that all of spring quarter will be held in an online format so I'm moving out of the freshman dorm. It's always been "F*CK FT and 2nd floor" but its sad to know that my time at FT was cut short; this isn't how my first year at UCSB was supposed to end… BUT, it could be much worse. In the midst of all the confusion and uncertainty of what to do next, I am writing from my bed, one hour before the assignment is due, planning out the outcome of my future. Of course, as Outkast sang, "you can plan a pretty picnic but you cant predict the weather." 
                      <br><br>



Anyways, here is what I came here to say. It is clear, if we want to continue to see life as we know it, human life, thriving on Earth, my generation has no other choice but to be the generation that stands up for our planet. My generation, (gen Z) grew up in a time where little to nothing was being done about the climate crisis. Things are changing quickly, glaciers dissolving greatly, sea levels rising exponentially and greenhouse gasses penetrating the air we breather at an alarming rate. I took this class because I shared a slight interest in it, and to be quite honest, it changed me. It changed my outlook, mindset, and lifestyle. 
                      <br><br>



I feel that I have learned so much, and I don’t want to let it go to waste. Among the most valuable things I've learned is the facts that when we consume beef, we are facilitating the growth of the agricultural industry which in turn, wipes out natural habitat across the globe. When we chose to fly, we are dumping massive amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere and when we burn fossil fuels, we are essentially intoxicating the air we breathe, while the big oil companies fund and facilitate the destruction of our planet in the name of higher profits. Learning these disturbing facts has ignited a fire in me, which is why I have pledged to stop eating beef and have chosen to pursue an environmental studies major. This upcoming spring, my schedule has changed for the better. I am enrolled in two classes that are designed to expose me to the environmental studies major. 

                      <br><br>


That is how I will be making my difference. I am not yet sure in which direction this major will take me but what I do know is that I love the outdoors, I love the ocean and I love nature, I know this degree will be a better match for me. Studies of the environment are studies that will lead to a better future. I intend to gain practical problem solving skills and become more of an activist by standing up for what I believe in and taking a more active role in politics. 



As of now, I am taking practical steps towards reducing my carbon footprint. I am proud to be able to say that I have not eaten beef for since may of last year, it has been a whole ten months! I bike myself almost everywhere in Isla Vista and UCSB and plan to continue on the bike path back home in Oxnard. I do not plan on flying anytime soon, but instead considering "slow travel" for my next trip. 


                      <br><br>

I know that my generation has to be the one to act on what we are seeing today. We cannot allow anymore days to delay our progressive actions, our clock is ticking and all we can do is take a stand and start somewhere. I want my future kids to see the natural world, I want to be able to show them the wonderful, natural sights that I've seen. But inevitably, unless I start acting right now and do my part towards a more sustainable lifestyle, my future kids, grandkids will likely suffer in ways that I do not intend to imagine.

                      <br><br>


Bottom line: I hope you find this YouTube comment knowing that you did something to change the path this generation started in. I hope you did your personal part, lived a simple and healthy lifestyle and spread the word to hundreds. I can't wait to see what you do.


                      <br><br>

The Year is 2060 and I am writing to you to tell a story of the past and how our actions affected the past 20 years and how they will affect the future. I remember the years around 2020 to be extremely scary regarding climate change. It followed the trends of continuing to record the hottest years and months on record year after year. There were terrible hurricanes and fires that began by displacing hundreds of thousands. That number soon moved to millions. This was before even the sea level rise really started to make people leave their homes close to the ocean and the mass migrations began
                      <br><br>

Most people, at least the smart ones, fully believed in anthropogenic climate change and were worried about what the future held. While a lot of people did they best they could by trying to limit their carbon emissions, it was not enough to make up for the damages done over the past decades and the increasing amounts of carbon that was being put into the atmosphere year after year. It got to the point where if the world governments did not step in, and step in soon, Earth would have been essentially non-recoverable. By 2028 people were finally starting to understand the TRUE severity of the situation we have put ourselves and the world in. The “natural” disasters were too much, it was affecting not only millions of families, but the economy and overall societal structure we have come to know. 
                      <br><br>

So in the 2032 elections politicians were elected and filled the house and congress that were dedicated and outspoken to starting to make an actual change to combat the climate crisis. Finally, there was some hope. It got to the point where people could not just look passed the problems at hand, they needed to be faced head on. The Green New Deal was finally passed and this would change the course of history for the U.S and the world forever. The Green New Deal had changed a lot from the time I first saw it, It was even more comprehensive and had specific methods in which to achieve all of the goals with a detailed plan of every couple of years. 
                      <br><br>

A massive overhaul of the U.S began with countries having to rapidly move to a net zero emission business model. This was very difficult for many businesses, but the government was able to help business achieve this goal if they qualified for it. Power girds were upgraded to be more effective and efficient using renewable and zero emission power. People that lost their jobs due to the change were trained and given new jobs that related to new energy practices compared to their old jobs that relied heavily on fossil fuels. 
                      <br><br>

While this was the biggest and most necessary step that had ever been taken, the results were of course not seen immediately. Natural disasters continued and global warming trends continued causing harm to millions and millions of people. But soon, things started to get better. With countries following the U.S lead, more and more governments were creating net zero emission countries. By around 2050, things finally started to get better. The warming rates were dropping, sea level rise slowed, and the fires and hurricanes began to calm down in frequency and intensity. 
                      <br><br>

The climate crisis was one of the biggest threat humanity has ever faced and it could have gone the complete opposite direction without headstrong and progressive thinkers putting the Green New Deal into action. AOC will forever be put down in U.S history and world history for her leadership and perseverance in saving the earth. 
                      <br><br>

Being honest, I was pretty sure that there was no hope, that Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos would have to somehow get humanity off of the planet, leaving 99.9% of the population to die with earth. I am glad it did not end up this way, but it very easily could have with the inaction that was seen throughout the 2010’s to the late 20’s. We are forever grateful for the revolutionaries that changed and saved the world.

Reminder to my older self                      <br><br>

Your first year at UCSB was one you will never forget. You couldn't stop talking about all the stuff you learned in sociology and environmental studies your first quarter. In what felt like your last quarter, you took English 23 (Climate Crisis 101) with probably one of your favorite professors ever, Ken Hiltner. Although you knew a lot about the issue, you were really happy that Ken brought such a different perspective. Throughout this time you battled with being environmentally conscious but being scare of change. Ken came up with all these amazing idea about personal action and you felt like you wanted to do something but you didn't know what yet. One of the first things you tackled was your diet. You really loved  Ken's idea of being a climatarian. You experienced instances of family members acting as "Uncle Pete", but you took what you learned from that reading and applied it. Telling your family members about you being climatarian gave you a chance to embrace how much you care about the environment. It helped to spread the idea too and allowed them to get new perspectives. After that, your family started to eat a lot less red meat. You also encouraged your family to minimize their use of unnecessary plastic water bottles. You started with making little changes within your day to day life and after awhile your whole family was making much better environmental choices. 
                      <br><br>
Once you got the basics of living a personally environmentally conscious life down, you decided that you wanted to do even more. After hearing about EcoVista in lecture, you decided you wanted to get a lot more involved in both your Isla Vista community and the one back home. Back home there aren't really a lot of community run events that acknowledge the climate crisis. Farmers markets are usually held and you thought it would be a great idea to have some kind of booth or station there that could be entertaining and educational at the same time. You coordinated with your local stores and helped to sell locally made and fair trade products. You also created informational flyers that came with every purchase, that said the basic facts of the climate crisis and the top ten things people could do to make a difference. 
                      <br><br>
As fall quarter of your second year at UCSB came around, you had very big expectations. You joined the Environmental Affairs Board, starting out as a member but you eventually worked your way up to an officer position. During that time, you also participated in events with EcoVista. You made so many new friends and were very glad that you decided to open up to new experiences. You never stopped believing in yourself and the possibilities for change that you alone could make. You were so grateful to have been in English 23. I hope you feel just as passionate now as you did in college.

<p>
We lived a life well fought, fighting for our environment and a sustainable future for our children. We accomplished a lot but it really began our second quarter at UC Santa Barbara when we were only 18 and enrolled in Climate Crisis 101 and Environmental Studies. We have always appreciated the outdoors and nature but it wasn’t until we took these two courses that we were alerted to how dire the situation was. We learned that if global temperatures increased above 2 degrees celsius we would have catastrophic events. These events include: food and water shortages, plagues, economic collapse, wars, sea level rise and an increase in the amount of natural disasters and their intensity. We saw examples of increased natural disasters and we read about them. Our first quarter at UCSB we were sent home early over Thanksgiving due to a fire close to our campus. My second quarter finals were canceled due to the Coronavirus pandemic. This was just the beginning. Life started to become a lot more crazier than it should be. It seemed like the “End of the World” every single day that we got used to it.
                       <br><br>
Although it seemed like the world was constantly ending, we got to work creating social and physical change. The first thing I did to help fight the climate crisis was I joined ucsb students for Bernie. Bernie Sanders was the only candidate that planned to fully support the Green New Deal and massive reforms to our economic and political arena. By joining I rallied my fellow peers and we campaigned Bernie to be the Democratic candidate. All summer I phone banked across states convincing moderates and swing states to vote for Bernie Sanders.  In November 2020 he went against Trump and came out victorious. I was so proud of all the hard work we did, knowing that we were helping contribute to change. This was our very first start and it only grew from there. 
                      <br><br>
 After Bernie was elected, he implemented sweeping changes around our country. First he proposed a carbon fee, that taxed all things that used created a carbon footprint. This led to a decrease in carbon emissions because people flew less, stopped buying gasoline for cars and people bought less stuff. This is a huge win for the climate because flying emitted more CO2 than any other form of transportation. This also hurt the fossil fuel industry because that's what they do, they literally sell carbon. By implementing this tax the fossil fuel industry loosened its grip on our economy and political arena. They didn’t have as much money to spend to spread propaganda and lies. This tax also led to people making the switch to renewable energy. My favorite thing!
                      <br><br>
 While Bernie was making changes nationally, I began making changes locally. After graduation, I applied for California’s Renewable Energy Infrastructure department. At the state level we began transitioning our old power grid to a new, smart, and updated power grid. This was a lot of work and we had a lot of unseen challenges. Our goal was to have California be carbon neutral by 2030. This meant that all houses, transportation and buildings emit zero emissions or produce their own energy. New houses and buildings all had to be made with sustainable materials and be made with passive solar designs. The grid had to be rebuilt and decentralized so that homeowners could have solar panels and so that when they had excess energy they would sell it back to the utility. There are also times when there wasn’t sunlight and so we had to find ways to store energy created and then release it when needed. We couldn’t solely depend on solar we needed to diversify our market. This lead to us investing in wind farms, geothermal energy (cheap and reliable) and hydro power. All of this was funded by the carbon fee President Bernie implemented. The State of California along with many others joined the national program of high tech public transportation. We built many high speed electric trains that connected big hubs together. San Francisco to Los Angeles now only takes 45 minutes on the California Gold Striker. To implement this I helped by working for an urban renewable energy consulting firm that helped advise the California government to make this transition. Today there is no more traffic on the old highways, the trains run timely and are full, and everyone views trains as the ideal way of transport. 
                      <br><br>
 After working locally, I decided it was time to run for congress. It was a fun campaign because I was running against one of the only conservatives left in our state that didn’t support the Green New Deal, so the win was an easy one. Once I was elected, I moved out to live in D.C. I lived in a micro apartment with minimal stuff. This is the new culture now; it is how we are saving the plant (the fast fashion industry is dead). It was Bernie’s second term and on capitol hill I continued to help push forward legislation that would benefit our climate. We helped negotiate and sign a treaty that caused the United States and other developed countries to spend our own resources and capital to help those developing countries like India and Bangladesh become industrialized without the use of fossil fuels. The United States led the way world wide transitioning to renewable energy. We showed everyone how to build a smart power grid safely and without the use of fossil fuels. We transformed the world linear economy to a circular economy so that less stuff is produced and wasted. This saved thousands of gigatons of CO2 to be produced. Also on the hill, we passed legislation that would limit destruction of land to be used for cattle. This meant that land that was not already taken by ranchers was permanently protected. This included forests and grasslands, both vital ecosystems. We also bought back land from farmers to make sure that they aren’t raising cattle. This decrease in beef production leads to even less greenhouse gas emissions and people switching to plant based diets.
                      <br><br>
 We have changed our country and world a lot and thankfully we did so or the climate crisis would have been much worse. We still over shot our mark on global temperatures and currently our average increase is 2.1 degrees celsius. Hurricanes are much more powerful and cities like New Orleans are uninhabitable. It is okay though, we have improved our society and all we had to do was try. My professor once said “what if the climate crisis is actually fake and we really created a better society for nothing.”  I’d like to think that it wasn’t for nothing. We created a better society and by doing so income inequality became non existent, people earned living wages, standard of living rose, there was equal access to education among boys and girls, we became healthier and we came to respect our planet. We did it. Humanity saved itself from itself and just in time.

 It’s currently 2020, and although we’re in a climate crisis, society may not have heard or done anything about it in a couple more years. As a first year at UCSB, you’re trying to get your GE’s out of the way and that’s when you enrolled in English 23. English 23, or Climate Crisis 101, has changed the way you do so many things. Kenneth Hiltner was in charge of this course, and made it so easy for individuals who were eager to get involved, actually make change. Going into the course not knowing anything about what was going on, you’re very close to finishing the class and becoming a climate crisis advocate. There are over 20 things that can make a huge impact on the well being of our Earth.
                      <br><br>

 The first half of the quarter was very much answering the question of ``What is causing such a crisis?” While the second half was focused more on what everyone can change to make a positive change. I learned so much about what causes CO2 emissions and what CO2 emissions are in general. I learned what fracking was and how bad that is for the environment. We also touched on politics, like what a hopefully past idiot president has done for the environment. I think it is important to remind yourself that the environment is not a red or blue issue, but a green issue. It’s crazy to think because your professor, Ken had made a lecture video apologizing for his generation’s lack of action on this issue but I hope you don’t have to follow in his footsteps. I actually think that the world around you is very slowly paying more attention to climate change. 
                       <br><br>

 It’s 2020 and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been one of the biggest advocates for climate change. She’s the representative for what you know as The Green New Deal. This plan is only the beginning steps of what we’re doing and I can’t imagine what’s going to happen by the time you’re reading this. These 14 pages are the only thing putting the environment on the subject plan for right now and it's important to understand them. All I wish now is for you to be part of the change that keeps the Earth healthy.

40 years ago I took this class about climate change taught by Professor Ken Hiltner. At that point in life there was clear evidence of the climate crisis but most people didn’t want to admit to themselves that this was happening. 40 years ago we were struggling, our president didn’t believe in things that would help change our world such as the green new deal. They continued emitting fossil fuels into the atmosphere because money was the only thing important in the presidents and politician’s eyes. This was affecting our planet globally. Fires were getting deadlier and storms were getting stronger. There was even a new category 6 hurricane. The oceans were warming and rising and sadly we lost a lot of our beautiful coral reefs. Australia was suffering immensely and lost most of its koala population. This was a rough time in the world’s past and it will be a time that is never forgotten. I just wanted to talk about some changes that have happened since that time of our lives. These past 40 years have helped our world flourish again. The democrats took back the office in the 2020 election. Bernie Sanders beat Trump but not by much. It was very close but we still pulled through. President Sanders enforced the green new deal and he stopped the major production of oil. This was a crazy time because I was living in Santa Barbara which has some of the main oil rigs. Communities started doing local gardens and moving towards solar power. This helped provide much cleaner air for everyone. Natural disasters weren’t as bad. Fire season suppressed and there hasn’t been a fire as bad as the paradise fire since it happened. We also started having public transportation available in all towns worldwide no matter the size of the town. The prices increased for flights making it a less reasonable source of travel. More people actually take trains everywhere now. People realized they are cheaper and more safe. We also ride bikes everywhere. More locally, in my close communities we started hang drying our clothes instead of drying them. We also had community pop-up thrift shops every Saturday morning. This helped stop people from buying brand new clothes from consignment stores. These past 40 years have been a big change for our world but I am happy to say a change for the better and not for the worse. I am happy our oceans and rainforests have started to come back and thrive and we have more fresh and breathable air. Also, 40 years ago I never thought there was hope for our world, I really did think it was ending. As you can see it is way better now though and all it needed was a person with big goals to help the world.

A message to my past self: 
                        <br><br>

It’s now the year 2060 and you’re probably wondering what happened to our planet in terms of climate change. I can say we survived mass climate change that would have been difficult to reverse; however, it was a journey getting to where we are now. Our country was divided on whether climate change was real or not. Could you believe that? Of course you can, you were living it. You saw people argue whether it was a hoax or not. The frustration you felt because you felt voiceless in a time where your future seemed uncertain. It felt that no one cared for the future and were too consumed in their own lives. Climate change should have been something that everyone was working towards fixing from the moment scientists made people aware. That wasn’t the case though. In 2020, we felt hopeless that we, as a society, wouldn’t be able to make the necessary changes in time. We felt hindered and voiceless. We had activists, such as Greta Thunberg, who fought against the system that would have continued to lead us towards irreversible environmental destruction. Even though you felt helpless, you continued to make changes in your own daily life by giving up meat and dairy. I know what you’re asking, what about hamburgers? Well you finally decided to try the impossible burger and turns out you can’t tell the difference. You even discovered oat milk which tastes better than regular milk! You educated yourself through environmental, political, and even English classes. You finally learned how to ride a bike and no longer impulsively buy clothes from unethical, fast fashion stores. Later on, you even got a job with the Environmental Protection Agency which allowed you to play a role in advocating for policies to implement! Although making changes in your daily life and career were a step in the right direction, they weren’t enough to halt the negative effects of climate change. Your years in university were filled with uncertainty due to natural disasters and viruses disturbing your education every year. It only got worse as the years went by, large fires kept overtaking California’s forests and sea levels kept rising. At your job it was difficult to achieve progress because fossil fuel industry interests were always prioritized. 
                        <br><br>

However, a large part of why we were able to achieve change had to do with the millions of incredible young people. Our generation stepped up and pushed representatives to not only make it mandatory for grade schools to teach about climate change but also educate older generations. We fought and fought for better representatives who listened to our voices and didn’t accept money from the fossil fuel industry. By voting the right people into office, we were able to make a transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050. It was hard trying to convince people that the long-term economic benefits were worth it. Everyone was scared about the negative economic impact we would take once we made the transition. I’m not going to lie, it was tough. You never realized to what extent the fossil fuel industry contributed to the economy until the transition started to take place. However, with the switch we were able to create more jobs for people. We also stopped relying on other countries for their natural resources which in turn improved our foreign policy and relationships. It decreased the amount of environmental injustices people in other countries faced because they were no longer experiencing large demands and war from us for natural resources. 
                        <br><br>

If it wasn’t for our generation and younger ones, I wouldn’t be here writing to you from the future. We would have continued in costly wars to attain natural resources that we were running out of. Large turmoil would have spread among people and there would have been clashes against climate refugees. Climate deaths would have increased. The ability to have children of your own would have also been nonexistent. Dare I say it, humanity would have been extinct. Which is why I write to you from the future to not lose hope and continue to educate people about climate change even if they’re stubborn. Fight for what you believe that is wrong with the system. Do it for your future kids and generations. Let them have the ability to experience the wonders of nature that you got to experience. Don’t lose hope, we will get through this. 
                        <br><br>

Sincerely,                        <br><br>

A message from the future

                        <br><br>

To whom it may concern,                        <br><br>
 
It is currently 2060 and I’m happy to report that we as a species somehow found a way to prevent ourselves and other mammals from going completely extinct. 40 years ago I was only a mere student learning about what the climate crisis was and how I should change my own life in order to save the only planet we live on. After word had spread that our planet was indeed worth saving, the common people of the United States and citizens from other major countries protested the government until they decided themselves that it was time to throw down harder regulations when it came to fracking and the meat industry. Many conservatives and deniers of climate change opposed this idea greatly but they soon realized that they were in the wrong and they should have agreed with the climate change pushers all around. Surprisingly, veganism is the top trend in the nation currently, and we have reduced emissions as a society by a whopping 70% already. One of the best things to have come from the climate crisis is that people now seem genuinely happy and the rates of depression have come down a lot in the last decade. I believe something about living more of a minimalist life has encouraged many generations of people that they don’t need a lot in order to be happy. I’m glad we’ve come such a long way since 2020. I don’t know how I survived in college with all of the deniers and uneducated people pushing to harm our planet more. My one advice to the people in the past is to never give up. Once you guys give up, our planet would face an inevitable end and I believe you guys are stronger than that. Can’t wait for you to see the future you form for yourself. 

                        <br><br>

Until then and with love, godspeed.

<p>
By now the year is 2060 and I’m sure much has changed since I am now writing to you 40 years prior while in the thick of the climate crisis. Over the past 50 years or so, humanity’s environmental impact has increased rapidly, and we are now facing the consequences of our actions. The climate crisis is happening now, and we are slowly reaching the point of no return if we do not act soon. America itself is one of the biggest contributors to this problem in regards to carbon emissions. In order to face this problem head on a global scale, America needs to serve as a model for other countries, as we have on many other issues, on how to effectively combat the climate crisis. This is and will continue to be no small task. Problems ranging from our dependence on fossil fuels, our largely meat-oriented diet, and our hyper-consumerist culture are among some of the many issues that we must make progress towards moving away from if we stand any chance in saving the Earth. 
                        <br><br>


In the past decade we have moved into a new era of the climate crisis, and younger generations who have been born into this issue are finally starting to make their voice heard. Young climate activists, like Greta Thunberg, are starting to make headway in worldwide media and are starting to push climate change towards the front of the politicians’ agenda - however, progress has been slow. Fossil fuel interests continue to have strong influence in government and have found a way to become an integral part of our modern culture. I hope by your time we are living in a culture that promotes sustainability instead of turning its back away from it. The question I want you to think about is how does one help steer our culture in this direction? While the problems we face are pressing and may create a sense of despair, I want to reassure you that we can all play a role in moving our culture in the right direction, and that we can all play a role in different ways. For me, I have just started to find my role in helping combat climate change and moving us towards a sustainable future in the world of fashion. 
                        <br><br>


Fashion is an important industry because it is an important part of our culture, but it is also an industry that has a disastrous environmental impact as our culture has evolved in recent years into one of hyperconsumerism and fast fashion. The average american today buys approximately 64 articles of clothing. In the 1980s that number was only 12. People today are pressed by today’s society to always be wearing the latest trend, and that results in an enormous amount of clothing being thrown away in an increasingly rapid amount of time. While one might argue for the elimination of fashion altogether as a solution to eliminate clothing waste, fashion has been around for centuries and is an integral component of a peoples’ culture. Fashion also represents a form of art and self-expression. In other words, fashion is not going anywhere. It’s not so much about eliminating parts of a culture as it is evolving that culture to promote the future in addition to the present. About a year ago, one of my best friends started his own clothing line and I quickly got involved as a designer because of my interest in graphic design. Recently, I came to the realization that I wanted our brand to not be one of these 'hypebeast' clothing brands like Supreme and others who release new products on a rapid timeline. What I have started to do is implement cut and sew into our brand identity. Instead of constantly outsourcing new materials that need to be made, I have begun to collect recycled articles of clothing and restyle them by sewing old fabrics together. My hope is that I can help move fashion towards a sustainable future where instead of just throwing out our old clothes we can recycle them into something that people consider ‘fashionable’. In this way we could make fashion more sustainable by using what used to be just clothing waste and making it into something that people will want to buy and, later, wear. I still have a long way to go, but my hope is that I can help progress this industry and our culture so that ‘new’ clothing doesn’t necessarily mean that it was made from scratch. In this way, I am helping fight the climate crisis in an industry/topic that I am passionate about. 

                        <br><br>

Anyway, the point of me writing about my personal experience is to show you that there are many ways you can help move our greater culture. You don’t necessarily need to sacrifice your personal interests in order to get involved in the fight for combating climate change. Find what you are passionate about and then find a way to get involved. We can only do so much alone, but we can also do so much in progressing our culture. As the newest youth in our world, you can continue this push for change and you can progress our culture in a variety of fields towards a greener future.

Dear future children,
                        <br><br>

It's your father writing to you from the year 2060. I wanted to write this letter to you to show how the Earth came together to tackle climate change. And if anytime during your lifetime your generation faces this kind of crisis, take this information I will tell you and look back on it. 
                        <br><br>


To briefly summarize climate change, it is a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular, a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. The change in weather patterns caused major wildfires throughout the west coast, hurricanes on the east coast, and the polar ice caps began to melt. The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into Earth's atmosphere and oceans. The extra CO2 caused temperatures to rise to levels that cannot be explained by natural factors. Our atmosphere is a key component of how our weather regulates. The increase in CO2 levels is deteriorating our atmosphere causing the temperature to fluctuate. Our goal for tackling climate change was to reduce our carbon footprints in order for the global temperature to not increase by 2 degrees. If the average temperature increased by 2 degrees, then the Earth would face major effects that could lead to the end of the planet and the human race as we know it. It's sad because America is the 2nd country contributing to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

                        <br><br>

Earth realized this and all world leaders came together to tackle the problem. We had to change and regulate industries, human lifestyle, and eco-friendly infrastructure/technology. We achieved all this thanks to the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal was a proposal that addresses climate change and economic equality. Industries are one of the major contributors to climate change. They produce the most GHG emissions compared to anything else. The working environment was very corrupted in fast fashion. Fast fashion is such a dominant force in the industry. They are about making trendy clothes that are quick, cheap, and disposable. To solve this issue we passed a carbon tax that limits the amount of GHG they are allowed to omit. Another contributor to climate change is us. Our diet, transportation, and lifestyle needed to change. Grocery stores started to cut down on meat products and advertise more plant-based foods. The less we eat meat, the more we reduce our carbon footprint. For transportation, we implemented bike paths and trains to cities in America. The less we drive, the less gas we consume leading to fewer GHG emissions. What really changed for humanity was the ideology of minimalism. Minimalism is all about living with less. This includes less financial burdens such as debt and unnecessary expenses. The philosophy is about getting rid of excess stuff and living life based on experiences rather than worldly possessions. Adapting to this lifestyle, people have lived a more happy and simple life. The less we consume, the fewer goods will be produced. 
                        <br><br>



Hopefully, this was interesting for you to read. You are not the only one on this planet, so we all need to work together to prevent this kind of tragedy again.


Love,                        <br><br>

In the past 40 years, climate change has been one of the most concerned events in society. Since 2020, the global temperature has been rising, and the melting of glaciers has led to the rise of sea level, making many countries now submerged in the sea. And because of the melting of glaciers, a lot of greenhouse gases and some viruses are released, which leads to people's panic. It's also because it makes more and more people realize the seriousness of the climate crisis. So the government started to let people implement the green new deal. People began to reduce the use of fossil fuels and began to use green energy without environmental pollution. And people began to live a minimalist life, avoid the waste of a lot of resources, and start to do something really meaningful to society. People greatly reduced the consumption of meat. Although they did not completely eat plants, they also reduced the cultivation of livestock. Reduce the pressure of livestock on the environment. The problem of mountain fires has also been greatly improved by the mitigation of the climate crisis. Although the future will be better, all of these are inseparable from your efforts now. Reduce the number of flights from the most basic, and use bicycles and buses when going out. To a certain extent, the concept of consumption should be changed. Actively participate in collective activities and voting, through which more people can understand the severity of the climate crisis. The climate crisis can not be solved by one or two things but requires people to invest a lot of time and practice, so as to slowly correct the global temperature.

Dear future self: To spare the world you have one strategic your carbon emanation. This implies you truly need to make changes that you'd most likely wouldn't have any desire to. Changes, for example, eating less meat or driving less. You additionally need to consider your legislature responsible, you cannot let them steer the world into its devastation. Its not simply your activity just however, its everybody around you. Changes will possibly happen on the off chance that you empower the individuals around you to make one. Ken says that when he was more youthful he read and being exceptionally scared for the future and here we are...still startled. I figure we can utilize our current worldwide occasions to place into point of view the intensity of our activities. With the coronavirus spreading, you see the impact it is having on individuals and the extreme estimates individuals are happy to take so as to prevent a world war situation.To spare the world you have one strategic your carbon emanation.

                        <br><br>
trust that we have placed cash into making this a reasonable issue. I realize this is the
                        <br><br>
place the vast majority of the legislative issues become an integral factor, yet thinking about the idea of governmental issues in 2020, I wouldn't wager many individuals are changing to the other side over the atmosphere. I plan to, meanwhile, keep on being by and by dynamic and do my little part just as urge others to do likewise. The United States has put out such an extensive amount the CO2 in the climate and I figure that we are by and by answerable for changing that also. I know it's difficult to get the age that basically made this ready, taking into account that they won't be around to experience the ill effects of the results, yet we should think less childishly.
                        <br><br>
During that timespan, flights were restricted and everybody for the most part remained at home to forestall its spread. Our worldwide outflows dropped from 38.8 billion metric huge amounts of carbon dioxide to just 10.9 billion. Fortunately, look into groups held their heads high and an antibody was in the end evolved in March of one year from now. Inside September of one year from now, the immunization was accessible worldwide in incredible amounts and individuals' feelings of dread bit by bit dwindled. Anyway awful the frenzy may have been, it was acceptable here and there. Worldwide emanations dropped fundamentally and permitted living beings and plants to recoup from biological systems being crushed by human extension. The hamburger business was for all intents and purposes totally ended and fracking was diminished by 85 percent.
                        <br><br>
We currently should keep on battling for our planet and not return to our old ways. Our atmosphere is still not in a perfect spot, anyway it is as yet recouping and will keep on recuperating as long as we bolster it. Recalling I was a youthful grown-up and having
                        <br><br>
numerous individuals around me imagining that we were destined and there was
                        <br><br>
positively no reason for attempting to spare our planet. Be that as it may, for those that stayed cheerful I am thankful, as a result of them we are presently improving and will just keep on moving towards a superior atmosphere.

I'm happy to say that by 2060, the climate crisis is under control. We are no longer in crisis because we took the necessary action to save the future of humanity. It wasn't easy and the work isn't done yet. Although the climate is under control and there is no longer any crisis to grapple, we can't simply return to how we were living 40 years ago. We learned that taking care of the planet (and everything on it) is a constant, just like taking care of your health. We are at a place, however, where we no longer need to change our action in order to survive. We simply need to continue doing what we are doing now (and of course adjust if new science deems it necessary). Now that we are at this point, I wanted to look back on the past 40 years to reflect on what you did to address the climate crisis and help us get to this point. 
                        <br><br>

It first started when UCSB went virtual because of COVID-19. While you were home, you encouraged your family to eat more like climatarians. It took a long period of patient persistence on your behalf, but your family finally started to eat less meat and eat seasonally and locally. Instead of rushing them into doing things they weren’t ready for yet, you first focused on things they already enjoyed. Dad always took pride in his summer vegetable garden (along with the fruit vines, bushes, and trees) and this was the first year that your compost pile was ready to be returned to the soil. Because of how much produce we produced, we didn’t have to buy as much of it from the store. You also used the success of our garden as an opportunity to talk to your family about the importance of eating seasonally and locally. This started out with a few small actions per week at first, but eventually we were frequent shoppers at the farmers’ market in our city and we eat more consciously than we ever did before. 
                        <br><br>

When it was time to come back to school, you continued this. You increased your participation with the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and Extinction Rebellion. You also talked to your friends about what they could do to help. You were already engaged in local politics at this time, but you increased your involvement and you did your best to influence your politicians to be more climate-minded. But the biggest thing you did was more system-wide. The ridiculous amount of meat served in the dining halls everyday always annoyed you, so you got together with a group of like-minded students to get the school to change their ways. This was a lot harder than convincing your family to eat with the climate in mind, but after a lot of time and energy, it finally happened. By the time our group accomplished this, it was time for me to graduate. But the younger students of the group continued their efforts to try to get other UC schools to do the same. 
                        <br><br>

After graduation, you didn’t go to grad school immediately. You took some time to work in politics. You got people excited about electing progressive candidate who were climate leaders on all levels of government from school board to the presidency. You also worked on progressive campaigns to make the country more Democratic and liberal. You also worked hard to make the Democratic Party more progressive and more climate-minded. This was incredibly rewarding. You were not only able to see the climate impact you were making, but the social impact too. These candidates were not only climate leaders, but they were fierce advocates for advancing human rights in this country. Our country listed to and uplifted Indigenous voices while we were taking their advice for how to care for our environment. We made giant corporations pay their fare share to clean up their pollution and work to heal all the destruction they did to the planet. 
                        <br><br>

After a few years of this, you went to grad school. While you were there, you learned everything you could about law and politics, especially about environmental law and environmental politics so you could run for office being as informed as possible. Gone was the era of politicians legislating on things they didn’t know anything about. Your journey wasn’t always easy. You didn’t always win every race and your colleagues weren’t always as ambitious as you were. But you were making good progress. After enough time in government, you emerged as THE climate candidate. You were public enemy #1 for greedy polluters, and you loved it (you still do). Thankfully you were not alone. The country became more and more concerned with climate change. As new leaders were elected, the government became an active force in combating the climate crisis and ensuring a livable planet for all. We also did so in a way that ensured a more fair and just society for all. Medicare for all passed, and higher education is free. We worked to ensure that people are being paid a living wage and are dignified in their work. We fought for racial and gender equality. We also changed our economy so that everyone has a fair chance at success, not just the wealthy and well-connected. 
                        <br><br>

By this time it is 2060 and you just became the newest Senate Majority Leader. You’ve pushed for green legislation and you’ve encouraged your colleagues to do the same. The Green New Deal was passed decades ago, but I’m still working hard to ensure that our country lives up to the climate promises we made. Looking to the future, I can see a bright world ahead of us where we have a thriving planet and a more just society for all.

My message from my future self:

                        <br><br>

It is now 2060, and the world has come together to save the planet. Our species has been saved due to the new laws that were put in place in 2030 limiting the emissions each country is allowed to emit per year with serious consequences if not followed. I myself played a part in limiting these emissions, as did most people. I started out by eating a completely vegetarian diet to help reduce my consumption of harmful-to-the-environment meat products. I started using trains instead of air travel to limit the disastrous emissions airplanes emit. On my way to work every morning, I used a green electric bike instead of a gas guzzling car. Throughout my life I have lived in shared housing, limiting my emissions further and lived in cities so my commute could be doable. I enforced these eco friendly practices within my family and made sure that all of my friends and family were aware of the harmful effects of our previously seemingly harmless actions. 
                        <br><br>


I am grateful for the experiences and knowledge I was able to gain while in school that helped propel me into this planet saving lifestyle. During my childhood, my parents taught me about the importance of Earth day. We would not use any electricity for the whole day in order to limit our emissions and to teach us the importance of doing so. Not long after this, middle school and high school taught me the basics of global warming. Despite this early start into becoming an environmental activist of sorts, my real knowledge of the global warming crisis was not until college where my love for the Earth exponentially increased as I added geography as my second major and took climate crisis 101 where I learned the majority of the important statistics and truths about the climate crisis. This inspired me to become a full environmental activist and enabled me to make a change for our planet so that we would not continue down the bad path towards our planet’s destruction. 

                        <br><br>

I want to apologize to the future humans that will someday have to deal with the consequences of this nightmare. Although for the most part we did our best to change things around, there were still many flaws in the course of this crisis. Although the generation above mine was unaware of the consequences of their actions, a huge impact had already been made. I am sorry that we were unable to reverse the effects of these mishaps, however I hope that we made it  the least bad case possible. I am sorry that there may be beautiful parts of the world submerged underwater, or that there are so many natural disasters a person cannot feel safe no matter where they are living. I hope that this is not the case, however I would not be surprised if it someday is. We really did try to turn things around for you, I promise. It just took longer then it needed to because some people were not on the same page as us. I hope that the world is able to thrive for generations to come as they did in the past.

Today is 2020, March 12th, Humans has been living underground as the Result of climate change. Because of the destroy of the atmosphere, daytime is extremely hot and night hours are extremely cold. Staying in the underground for so many years, my life has been replayed for many times in my mind. What If…
                        <br><br>

  I still remember in 2020 march 12th, we were all caring about flu viruses. My ENG 23 professor Ken was still trying to tell people what they should do to save the planet from climate changes. We learned about lottos knowledge in his class, such as we need to waste less food, ride more bikes, fly less, flying is a transportation for only 1% percent rich people on the earth but is attributed for 25% of the greenhouse emission each year…And we also watched lots of fantastic movies. We learned from Al Gore, we learned from Peter Calmus, they lighted up our passion… 
                        <br><br>

  And lots of us from that class became climate justice fighters. We tried to protect our planet from those mercenary people who under the carrier of oil
                        <br><br>

And animal raising. We really did, but sadly, we could not change those people’s mind. Yeah, they could make lots of money each year, who would give it up for environment? However, the climate issue became more and more severe every year.
                        <br><br>

 And 2030 Jan 9th—I would never forget that day, the atmosphere went down in some developing countries in south east Asia, and people suddenly could not open their eyes and almost melting. In fewer than half a year, the last standing city—Copenhagen went down. The government started to have emergency council and decided to dig up for tunnels to live, abandon the ground areas and search for new planets to live. And the time just passed by…
                        <br><br>

  What if we can stop it? What if we care more about the planet instead of just ourselves, of just greedy money…

A message from the future:
                        <br><br>

It's 2060, and the world has now finally freed itself from the disastrous change it had to endure for over a century. The "climate crisis" will now be a lesson in the history books, and it's still hard to believe that after all of this time things will finally be okay. Looking back on my life, it all started in the year 2020, 40 years ago, that global warming had turned into climate change for me and that I finally realized why it truly was a climate crisis. I was a second-year at UCSB just learning about the dangers our earth was facing and what seemed to be the inevitable consequences of our very own actions. While learning about the numerous ways that could promote sustainability and renewable energy had provided a sort of light at the end of the tunnel, pure hope was not enough to disguise the reality that our future seemed imminent and bleak. 
                        <br><br>

That didn't stop people from fighting though, since the turning point began during the 2020 election, which resulted in Trump being replaced in the Oval Office. The first thing that had reached major news upon the action of the new president was the United States' rejoining of the Paris Agreement and tremendous amounts of money being poured into the research toward renewable energy sources and technology. Over time, the US  had been able to develop new technology that made transportation and energy cleaner. Airplanes and cars were modified to have greener technology, making them more eco-friendly for the skies and the roads. And even at the base problem behind these electric cars and their manufacturing emissions - they were resolved as well. The vast amount of money that was utilized to conduct new research resulted in greater output at factories and significantly reduced carbon emissions worldwide by 2030. The footprint that had been drastically reduced by these industries alone was enough to blow my mind. 
                        <br><br>

The polarized views between political parties unified and began to see climate change as a human problem; it was no longer about politics. As a nation, they realized that the future, the well-being of the people, and the rights that they fought for many centuries ago deserved to be preserved for many generations to come. Less false information was spread, and the world was educated on the real issue at hand. The Green New Deal passed, significantly revamping the nation's economy and efficiency. The economy was booming, the people's morale was high, and the movement kept on growing. The world's leaders followed suit and cooperated to create an endless cycle of business operations and transactions that benefitted everyone involved and the environment itself, instituting a flowering relationship among nations.
                        <br><br>

Over the years, the younger generations had a more vested interest in fighting the continuing battle of climate change - a passion that I had never seen so widespread and culturally normal. Plant-based/reduced meat or meat substitute diets had become the norm. Permaculture was the new trend. The world had a fever for green. The media had a part in sharing the stories of many and the importance of living sustainably, which was something that my generation had pushed for and advocated as we fought and continued to fight. It was something that kids were raised on and families had implemented as their children grew up. By 2045, the fossil fuel industry had almost become obsolete. Crude oil was no longer an option in the public eye. It just did not benefit anyone. And with the continuing improvements to greener lifestyles, that only made the craze for green even more desirable. Carbon neutral communities were fostered and developed, and the idea of "bigger is better" was replaced by numerous tiny homes and an "urban flight." Suburbs became less common, as the younger generations began to flock toward the cities. We knew that one of the biggest contributors to mitigating climate change was a cultural shift, and we made it happen. It took a couple of generations, but we did it.
                        <br><br>

We could've stayed put where we were in terms of fighting climate change, since the world was relatively stable. But the movement kept on growing for the next 15 years. And if you could only imagine how amazing the world looks now, the world I saw 40 years ago could never compare. 
                        <br><br>

Had my professor not taught that class, the climate movement that had grown during my time there might not have reached the level of exposure that it did. Maybe the world would've been different, but I'm glad that it turned out the way that it did. I know that right now, you might feel lonely in your fight because what is one person in a sea of 8 billion. But trust me that the numbers will grow. And it will worsen before it gets better, and people will fight back against your movement and your beliefs. The movement will fail before it reaches a success but know that the oceans won't become poison, the disasters will almost cease to exist, and the grass will get greener. Knowledge will always be power squandered, so please go out with what you have right now and live your life doing the right thing.

I wish I could have written this letter from the future years ago. The past two years have been severely discouraging. For every step forward in environmentalism in our government for the past 50 years, Trump has taken two steps back; all in the name of our economy. The American public has been coaxed into believing that the economy we run on is healthy for both our society and for the Earth. We’ve been led to believe that things could be worse, and that capitalism is the only functioning model a society can be built upon. Capitalism is a positive feedback loop that is only worsening our societal structures and continuously harming our natural counterparts. I don’t know enough about government and economics to say this with the utmost confidence, but I do know the Earth. I know that she is hurting. I see it reflected every day, and it’s something I know will only worsen in the future. I used to think it was a scientific issue, but after this class and others, I now know that it delves into every aspect of life, but that it is, in fact, mainly a social and cultural issue. Most of the science necessary for these changes already exists. It can be improved upon, surely, but that is not the main issue. Our relationships in life are what control how we affect the world around us, and our attitude and relation to the Earth is causing a big problem today. People care more about money and success than they do for other people and the environments they live in. We have misplaced our hearts into endeavors that will bring us little to no long-term happiness. This is a letter from the future though, so let me take a step back. This is what I would have written a couple years ago as my “letter from the future”. Despite the doubts I have, if I were to imagine a future that I’d want to live in, and I’d want my children’s children to live in, this is what it would be:
                          <br><br>
       A warm beam of sunshine tickles at my eyelids, beckoning me awake. The large window that encases one side of my wall provides enough light for me to go the whole day long without a single bulb. What energy I do use is from a solar panel wall that covers the roof of the garage of our small housing complex. The roof of the building I live in is a communal greenhouse that any of the tenants can get fresh food from. 
                        <br><br>
I roll out of bed, excited to go to work. I pull on some clothes that were made for me by a sweet old lady on the second floor and start boiling some water to make some oatmeal that I will compliment with seeds and fruit. I can hear the jazz music floating up from my downstairs neighbor who has just started to practice her life’s pursuit and motivation. People doing what makes them happy; it never fails to make me smile. 
                        <br><br>
I head out into the city. As I pass down the spiraling staircase, I see Paula Maria, Tom, Denise and Gloria all heading out to work as well. I make sure to great them all and make small talk. Denise’s daughter has just found a new beau at her work on the urban farm 3 blocks down. Paula Maria’s grandchildren have a recital tonight that I am welcome to attend at 8pm in the orchestra hall, and Tom and Denise are supposed to go to their friends’, Katie and Dahlia, baby shower. Living on our complex is like living with extended family. There are some weird uncle and grumpy grandparent types living in the complex, but it’s not that bad. In fact, I wouldn’t trade it for the world. I step out into the street and smile. 
                        <br><br>
It doesn’t smell like smoke and the streets are bright with the morning light. The sidewalks are wide, and the bike lanes are even wider. There are two lanes for cars where taxis and buses pass. Few personal cars exist today; it’s simply not economically [feasible/easy] and frankly, it’s slow, not to mention the environmental implications. There are so many other options that can get you where you want to go in even quicker time. There is an electric bus stop right across the street, about 50 yards from my complex. There are 3 tram stations in the area, and 2 train stations, all in a 4-block radius. The closest tram stop is one block away, but I prefer the one 4 blocks down the way because I love passing all the parks and the city life. As I make my way to the tram station, I pass 8 different parks. 3 of them, I weave into, wanting to pass through the green trees that shatter diamonds of light onto the grass. Clovers dot the ground, birds hop and sing, and little squirrels climb through the canopies. Two of the 8 parks I pass through connect all the way to the forest that surrounds the city in a U-shape as to allow for animals to venture into the parks. Occasionally, one might catch glimpse of a deer or a rabbit. 3 of the other parks I pass surround small ponds where fish and crawdads live, and one of them you can even fish in with a permit. The last 3 parks are mostly for leisure and are grassy spaces dotted with differing trees and wooden benches. The only people who sleep on benches are sleepy workers who lounge in the sun or under the protective shade of a tree for an hour or two. There aren’t homeless like there were back in the day because our government takes care of each and all of its citizens, providing them with jobs to start new lives and housing in large complexes. Many military bases have been transformed into rehab centers to get people back on their feet, hospitals, natural spaces, and you name it. 
                        <br><br>
I get on the tram and look through the clean windows at my beautiful city. You can see the forest beyond peeking through the rooftops. 
                        <br><br>
I work in an elementary school. We teach children to love and care and be compassionate. We teach them to follow their hearts and use their creativity. I take my class to the woods once a week to have class under the trees. 
                        <br><br>
My family lives in the city as well. We get together once a week to spend the day together on a picnic in the park or for a family dinner. My brother works close to my favorite sustainable coffee shop, so I visit him often to bring him a coffee or a scone. He works for the government, coming up with new ways to facilitate public transport and improve it to make it safer and more enjoyable for the people who live in the city. My parents come over even more often to take care of my 2 children. They are a big part of their lives. Our family is more connected, and we are more connected to our environment. We love and honor the natural would we are a part of. 
                        <br><br>
In my free time, I love writing. I love sitting in the park closest to my house and writing about fictional worlds with magic and heroes. My own heroes brought sustainability and environmental awareness and appreciation to our society years back. They made the world we live in today a place that I am happy to raise my 2 children in. They inspired love and community back into my life. I, too, contributed to the movement in my own way. I was one of the biggest activists in the field, and my writing inspired others around the world to care too. I eventually went into teaching, an even more important job, I think. I work at a public school and I get paid well. Today, our teachers are paid much more than they were when I was growing up, and it’s about time. They do so much for us all. They’re so extremely important and I wish our society had treated them as such sooner, because they deserve it.




</p><hr>


<p>

Just be patient. Good things are going to come so soon and the earth and all organisms on it will start to thrive and flourish. I know things aren’t going well right now with the ignorant and unqualified government leaders, but it is going to get better and be okay eventually. Have faith in your generation and the people around you who know this is a problem and are working hard to fix it. It is so easy to feel alone and helpless, as such a small, single individual in a world of 7 billion people and try and remember that there are many other people who feel the same way. 
                        <br><br>

Be excited for what’s to come! Everyone will soon come to understand the extent to which climate change will affect us all. They will see how everything on this planet is interconnected and equally important and dealing with climate change will also improve and benefit so many other parts of society. People started realizing that life isn’t all about money and stuff we own, but more about the relationships and experiences we share with our loved ones. People started working less, leaving more time for family and friends, which increased overall happiness across the world and helped establish better connections between people. With less time at work, I spent my time exploring the beautiful world around me and connecting with as many people as I could. I truly believe that connections and relationships we have with people make us feel happy and cared for which then is passed on to people we come in contact with, influencing their lives in a positive way. Being happy and kind to the people around us creates a never ending chain of positivity and compassion, making the world a better place. We all stopped basing success off of monetary value and started being truly successful in the way we loved and treated one another. This completely shifted the way society ran and the demand for material goods went down, driving down all the harmful environmental effects of production by a huge amount. This decrease in demand also made it so that the fast fashion industry died off and people working in factories were no longer at risk of disease or death from their job. Instead, the new societal structure opened up new, safer and more enjoyable, fulfilling jobs. In addition to the change in our consumption habits, we also shifted towards completely renewable energy and solar panels, wind turbines and many other, cost efficient and zero emission sources. The fossil fuel industry was outed as destructive and dishonest and the power and influence they had over so many people, was taken down and the power turned to the people. Government officials were now influenced by what the people wanted, not the money that companies like Exxon put in their pockets. This took billions of cars off the street and everyone started riding bikes and using public transportation. Believe me, riding the bus and biking is fun! Bike lanes were developed safely and buses became nicer, more clean and more efficient. 
                        <br><br>

Not only did we shift society's idea of success and happiness and move away from fossil fuels, we also, as a whole planet, got more connected and in touch with our earth and our appreciation and wonder for the planet grew immensely, making people treat it with respect and care. Deforested lands were replanted with new trees, ecosystems were recovered, habitats were protected and our oceans got cleaner. While there was a lot more ecotourism and attraction to parks and beaches, the appreciation for these places was also greater, so these places were able to be enjoyed while also being preserved and kept healthy. With this newfound connection with nature, people became healthier and spent more time outdoors. Appreciation of nature went along with appreciation of animals and many people switched to a much more sustainable “climatarian” diet. Yes, people FINALLY realized how cool and amazing cows were. Not only did these vegetarian, vegan, and climatarian diets improve the health of our planet, but also the health of the people on it, drawing down the amount of obesity and heart disease. People were healthier and happier because of what they were putting in their bodies. Food became something more natural and less processed. The overall wellness of our planet and all species on it improved in so many ways. 
                        <br><br>

So, when you are feeling alone, helpless, pessimistic, afraid, and exhausted over the intensity and danger of climate change, just know, it will get better and things will improve. Despite what a lot of people around you are saying right now, quality of life will improve and the things we all find value in will shift. We are today, still facing some harmful consequences of climate change, but not nearly to the extent at which we would have if we hadn't done anything or changed. Your generation was able to come together and create REAL change and actually do something about the crisis, changing the world for the better. So be excited! Be hopeful! Be positive! Because there is so much good in store for this planet and everyone on it.

Hey, how are you doing?

                        <br><br>

I hope you have found some path in life by now and that you have met some amazing people who care about you and you care for the same amount. I hope the world isn't too crazy. Right now, it's 2020 and there is a virus going around that was sort of unprecedented 2 weeks ago but now it is changing our lives. I'm at home writing this last assignment and I am pretty much quarantined to my house...

                        <br><br>

Anyways, I hope that you are still a strong believer in spreading awareness of climate change. I'm sure the climate is already way different then where I am now, in sunny San Diego. I hope people and corrupt politicians are realizing this isn't bullshit and that policies like the Green New Deal have been implemented. I hope the cars are electric and people are planting gardens in their homes and in the cities. I hope we all care.

                        <br><br>

Another thing, I hope you are feeling pretty healthy, maybe you decided to go vegan (go you) and now you're feeling better than ever, or maybe you haven't but now reading this you'll finally decide to lol. 

                        <br><br>

I just hope you're happy with the way you have decided to live...cause that's really what matters.

Dear Me,
                        <br><br>


It’s currently March 12, 2020, and I’m fairly close to finishing Climate Crisis 101, otherwise known as English 23. I will be turning 20 this year, and within my lifetime, a lot has rapidly changed. In this day and age, the Earth has suffered through permafrost, climate plagues, ocean acidification, and now, a global pandemic. Through technological development and social media, there is very quick access to information. In my opinion, this has been a blessing and a curse. To those who are reading this in 40-50 years, I cannot imagine how much will have evolved and changed by then. 
                        <br><br>


Currently, we are undergoing multiple global crises in regards to culture, environment, politics, and more recently, a global pandemic. I have continuously emphasized that the climate crisis should not be viewed as a political or economic issue. As a collective society, there should not be any divide on whether the climate crisis is real or not. This divide has obviously gotten us nowhere, since we’re already increasingly releasing carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Rather than debating, we should’ve been coming up with solutions to mitigate this crisis. This divide between people has become even more prevalent now that the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been integrated into the equation. Instead of remaining calm and figuring out solutions, people are rather panicked. In a time where there are so many flaws in the world, it’s important to be cohesive and communicative in order to be safe. 
                         <br><br>

In the past, many Americans knew that our practices were going to affect the planet, but remained ignorant/selfish in hopes of making money and gaining power. People have also become accustomed to having basic necessities readily available for us that there’s even a surplus. There’s simply no motivation or collaborative effort to make a change, but there’s no better time to start. To prevent this generation from making the same mistakes as the Boomer generation, it’s important to know just how much our lifestyle and choices impact society and our planet as a whole. Ultimately, we’re coinhabitants of the same place. Whether changes are small or large, it would tremendously help in mitigating the crisis if more people felt inclined to do so. I believe in the trickle down/domino effect, and this leads to hope for this generation and future generations.

<p>
My message from my future self:
                         <br><br>

The year is 2060, and I’m almost 60 years old now. Our nation and its people have significantly progressed their standing on the climate change for the better. The United States of America has done an exceptional job of reducing its carbon footprint and helping other 1st world countries do the same. Even the people of the U.S. are doing whatever they can to reduce their carbon footprint, such as buying bicycles instead of cars or living in more eco-friendly housing. Its been an honor living in a country that does so much for betterment of the environment.
                         <br><br>

 Within the span of 40 years, the citizens of the United States of America began to understand the gravity of the climate crisis after the country began seeing frequent fires in the west, more hurricanes in the east, and catastrophic flooding in the south. Inevitably, for the betterment of the people’s well-being and for the safety of future generations, Americans began banding together and started putting politicians who sought to decrease the carbon footprint of the nation. As a result, U.S. became more left than right. In my opinion, this is for the best.
                         <br><br>

  Additionally, classes that taught my generation about what we can do to improve the state of our planet were crucial to the change our nation saw. Classes, such as English 23, were essential for the eco-friendly movement. As a result of English 23 and others like it brought the change the world was looking for by educating my generations on simple methods to live a more eco-friendly lifestyle. This included things like having a vegetarian lifestyle, taking public transportation, or voting for politicians that intend to do more for the planet. Without classes, such as English 23, I doubt or nation would be in a good situation.





</p><hr>


<p>
To my future self. This is to write to you now because I know you are in your Climate Crisis Class at UCSB right now. You should be in your second year of college. I am doing well. This is really to tell you about the state our climate is in. 
                         <br><br>

We did not do enough back in the day. We should have started adjusting our lifestyles and attacking big business practices and fossil fuels a long time before anyone figured out it was a bad idea. We really tried, we did, we tried to get the message out quicker and immediately after we found out what a big deal it really was. However, by the time we finally adjusted our lifestyles the earth was damaged.
                         <br><br>

Since then we have gone to all sustainable energy sources, only electric production of products and electric vehicles are allowed. Everyone on the earth is vegan due to a worldwide law that passed 20 years ago. For now, we did what we could for the earth. But we cannot get back all the years of having politicians and companies deny the existence of climate change, so that is the main reason why I am writing to you now. It is my thought that if the news gets out faster in 2020 and people take it seriously right then that we can stop it then, or now to you. 
                         <br><br>

What really needs to happen is for Bernie Sanders to get elected. I believe that if Bernie gets elected now it will do a great deal for the earth. However, that's not what happened in my reality. Trump got re-elected for another 4 years and did nothing but deny the existence of climate change. Eventually all of the other countries in the world got on boad with the fact that climate change was a big deal. Except the USA still had Trump as their president and he denied it his entire presidency. Esentially doubling fossil fuel extraction and fracking. 
                         <br><br>

Here are some ideas that we thought of 20 some years ago that would probably be a help to you now.
                         <br><br>
In my time everyone has their own garden in their backyard
                         <br><br>
We converted the entire world to veganism and have reduced CO2 emmisions from methane greatly
                         <br><br>
Cars are virtually non existant as almost all school and work is done by robots technology or from home on laptops
                         <br><br>
When we do leave the house it is on a motarized electric bike or scooter. 
                         <br><br>
We live in very close proximity to everythuing, esentially living directly around the areas we need to be in on a daily basis
                         <br><br>

I hope this helps you and I look forward to seeing any changes you might have made. Life treats you well dont worry about it

From,                          <br><br>

A Message from the future:  While this may seem dark, this is a possible, albeit extreme, scenario of our future

I am you in the year 2060, and I am writing to you about the climate crisis that you grew up in the center in.  I must add that it is not over, but we have greatly reduced our carbon footprint to a manageable level.  Through the 20’s we moved slowly to make change and very little happens to male the environment better.  It was business as usual except for the commercial development of Electric Vehicles and renewable energy sources.  Through the mid 30’s little was done to combat climate change.  While many South Pacific islands faced huge floods and millions were relocated, most developed countries did not make any extraordinary policy change to combat the But in 2034 there was a huge hurricane that ravaged the southern united states such as Florida, North Carolina and Georgia.  On top of this, large wildfires broke out in many midwestern states where wildfires are not as common. On top of this, China, Africa, and much of Europe faced severe famines due to drought.  
                         <br><br>


The destruction and death led to direct action and a worldwide movement to reduce emissions and food waste. This was one the the greatest human tragedies with tens millions of people dying within 5 years. By 2040 Almost all energy on earth is produced through geothermal, nuclear, solar, or wind, with very little shale or oil being used. We have seen direct improvements to the environment, however we still face extreme weather from the damage of the past 80 years of polluting.  With massive carbon capture machines becoming popular and a mass movement to plant billions of trees, experts predict our atmosphere will return to normal in 10-20 years.  One of the greatest improvements to the environment stemmed from the impossible burger.  While Americans never gave up their love for hamburgers and meat products, meat replacement products took over.  When people started feeling the effects of climate change, there was a shift to plant based diets.  Beyond Meat and Impossible Company had perfected a line of products that were cheaper, healthier and better for the environment than real meat was, and the beef industry took a huge hit.  While people still eat cow products, their demand has cut in half, and it continues to shrink.  On top of that, 500 million more people from 2020 have become vegetarians.  The movement has been destigimized, and in some cities it is almost uncool to eat meat.  There has also been a mass extinction, but we are also seeing the beginning of new species forming, showing how Earth will always come back.  This is a new age for scientists to be able to study between mass extinctions and how evolution works.  This is leading to new discoveries, and new information that humans can use.  However, we are also discovering that there was an extinction coming either way, but we just sped it up.   
                         <br><br>

We should have acted more decisively in the 20’s, however it was not the end of the world.  We faced our consequences and we now look back on how stubborn we were to change.  One issue is that it was mainly the poor and most vulnerable who were affected by the negative  effects of climate change, and they were the people who contributed the least.  This led to extraordinary efforts and donations to fully develop food and water access, so now no one on earth is chronically hungry or in drought.  We have also invested more into technological research and our new technologies have made our lives so much better and we can live much longer.  The effects of climate change really just forced humans to act.  Our old ways were not viable anymore so we needed to find solutions and to make big changes.  While it is a shame it required so much death and pain, It is good that we were able to put aside our differences to limit these atrocities.  I now believe if we ever predict another existential threat to the human race, we will work together sooner and not put our short term benefits over the long term health and safety of the human race.

Hi nephew, 
                         <br><br>
I hope this letter finds you helpful in writing your essay about the environmental change we have experienced since 2020. The world wasn’t always as it is today.. Many of our forests were in flames. There was more trash in the ocean than there was fish. Extreme weather became more prominent. Flus and viruses were more periodic. Hundreds of species were going extinct by the day. We were warned for years by environmentalists and climate scientists that human actions were degrading the environment and would immensely impact anyone and anything inhabiting the earth: rising sea levels, acidic oceans, health complications, increase in hurricanes, extreme droughts, earthquakes, heat strokes and more. But corporations were more interested in earning fast money that the coal industry offered. They were successful in discrediting scientists by reaching the general public the same way the cigarette industry was successful in assuring the American public that smoking did not cause health complications, perfectly knowing that wasn’t the case at all. Thus, the American public was once again blinded by critics that climate change was not real, that climate change was a hoax. Others argued that climate change was not human caused. Knowingly, many countries continued to burn fossil fuels, including the United States. 
                         <br><br>
I’ll never forget my college experience. About 60 years ago, various fires endangered communities and caused thousands of people to evacuate their homes. Species and indigenous tribes were dying or left without a home due to the Australian wildfires. A virus broke out endangering the lives of individuals who had weak immune systems, specifically children and the elderly. 2020 was the year I remember realizing just how fast we must have been reaching our tipping point. It was one catastrophe after the other. However, seeing the way that our government was responding to the virus began to give me hope that maybe we wouldn’t be too late afterall. Governments were quick to act and declared state of emergencies to stop the virus from spreading so fast. At the same time, the run for office as president of the US was also happening. As environmental disasters became more prominent, the American people had to vote for the best candidate who would take drastic measures to relief the impact our standards of living were impacting the environment. 
                         <br><br>
In the year 2019, an idea for a bill that would address the implications of climate change was introduced as the Green New Deal. This bill proposed that the US would spend trillions of dollars in promoting a sustainable environment by stopping all reliance on fossil fuel energy and moving towards a more renewable energy reliant economy. Additionally, the bill proposes free healthcare for all, access to food, clean air and water, etc.. As the biggest supporter of the proposal, Bernie Sanders became president of the United States in 2020. Action was taken immediately. Carbon taxes were introduced and the oil and coal industries soon began to lose profits. Subsidies on renewable energy were established. Other countries began to follow and we were making progress in rapidly reducing carbon emissions. Of course, the consequences from having relied on the burning of fossil fuels continue to affect us. 
                         <br><br>
It was not easy to get to where we are today where so many new policies have been put into place to resolve these issues. As part of the younger generation at the time who demanded changes in policies and regulations, we had a lot of work to do. Voting was the beginning and one of the most important steps to begin that change. At the time, the vast majority of people who were in office were part of the older generations and more prominent to disagree with the new proposals. It took political activism and spreading knowledge about what a changing climate implied on the well-being and future of the planet and its generations to come. Developing the Green New Deal into a viable plan took time. Through environmental activism, we promoted changes in everyday lifestyles to the public, we rallied outside governmental institutions to urge members in office to help pass the bill by signing. We drew petitions to pass regulations that wouldn’t just improve the well-being of the environment but would improve human rights. Sanders as president allowed for this change to begin. Our communities have improved because most of the following presidents have led similar agendas.
                         <br><br>
 Beginning at a personal level, I began cutting out meat from my diet, because eating meat was a more cultural dining it was a big change for me. I started eating more chicken until I finally switched to a vegetarian diet and later a vegan diet. For me, I knew the process was going to be slow as meat has been very popular food in my culture. I do not regret my choice at all, it has been such a great experience. I feel healthier. Many began to do the same. Soon I began influencing my friends and family to adapt to a greener diet. In addition, I performed community service hours in cleaning beaches during college as I lived right on the beach. I became more involved in community planning to improve a sustainable lifestyle amongst residents. After college, I began working for a nonprofit working in improving the lives of people experiencing environmental racism in their communities by creating more services and resources, primarily in preventing food insecurity and having affordable and accessible health care.
                         <br><br>
The most amazing thing that happened out of all this is that people stopped relying on their cars in their everyday life. Instead, many began to walk, bike, or use public transportation to get to work or school. The carbon tax was working as it should have. As a result, human health and development has continued to improve. The investment in infrastructure and technological advancements in promoting a greener environment continues to be developed. There will always be a struggle to continue to build our economy while living in harmony with the environment. There is still so much to do as we continue to adapt to our climate continuing to change today, I hope your generations continue to contribute to our greener planet.

Yesterday, my dearly, lovely granddaughter, Charlotte, was born, with the hope of our entire family. Now, at my 60, I am writing this diary to record this moment. 
                         <br><br>
This is the magic about life and nature. The coming of a new human being always brings you back to the very origin of everything. When I was little, I remember most of the buildings I see were relatively short. They normally located near lakes where fishes swimming happily with each other. It is such a pity that my Charlotte will never see a fish. Yes, the fishes, the entire species, died out a decade ago because of over fishing. 
                         <br><br>
Charlotte was born at the age of a horrible crisis. People are dying because of the shortage of food and overheating. We are fortunate, though. My husband, Thomas, works at climate science organization. As a data scientist, he discovered that the climate, not the weather, is increasing dramatically at a rapid rate because of the elimination of polar ice. As a result of that, we soon decide to move to Alaska where we can enjoy the cooler weather. 
                         <br><br>
Forty years later, the Green New Deal, set by people at my generation, start to function in the society these years as the democrats finally took back the White House. It is true that they take serious actions on reducing climate change, but it is just too late. It is too late for us to act. Data from the satellite indicates that climate change in the last century is just not going to turn back. 
                         <br><br>
Facing the shortage of food and biomass, our government recently set the “Black New Deal”, in which forces every citizen to live in the cities to minimize their carbon footprint. All huge houses are going to be abandoned. Department of Animal Protection will use them to foster wild animal with the aim to reserve the diversity of wild animals. As we are moving to Alaska, the regulation power is not so horrible to us. But what I have heard from Angela, my best friend, is horrible. People are being forced to leave where they have lived since they were born, only bringing necessary items. 
                         <br><br>
When Charlotte was at my age, what will the life at that time look like? How will she going to survive at that time, she is so small right now. How I wish people at my generation can set up a healthy environment for her.

Well, I need to reply, so I need to borrow this floor.

                         <br><br>

Today is 03/14/2060. The world outside is chaotic. People are fighting for limited resources since there are only a few habitable places for us. The population was decreased tremendously in recent 20 years. Some of them are killed by nature, while some of them are eliminated by ourselves for keeping the balance between population and resources. The governments still want to hind the crucial situation. We, the public, have already known it, but no one dares to shout it out. Estimating my position on the level of wealth, the end day is really close to me. Either by natural disasters or accidents.
                         <br><br>


Today is 03/14/2060. The world is more developed. The climate crisis has been solved already by applying renewable energy, environmental-friendly policies, etc.  However, there comes out more global problems, such as over-population, the conflict between the wealthy and the poor. There are many people standing up for these problems like the people who solved the climate crisis before. We can absorb the experience of the climate crisis. Maybe 40 years later or even a shorter time, these issues will also be solved, and people start to figure out some new problems.  

                         <br><br>

Today is 03/14/2060. The world is wonderful. There is no problem and conflict in the world. Everyone gets satisfied with his or her own life. It is just like a Utopia. Oh, this is just a dream. Never mind.

To my future:

                         <br><br>



2020 starts tough. An airplane accident took away my favorite basketball player, his daughter, and other 7 great people’s lives forever; Even worse, COVID-19 has spread over the world and killed people. Sarcastically, people are still unaware of the severity; They go to party, they make fun of people who wear masks on the street, and some even make racial comments. Yeah, people never realize severity of the issue until the heavy consequence falls upon them, and by the time they start to regret, there is always no remedy. So, I wish, by the time you're me, the earth is still well-shaped, and the grown-up me has educated a lot of people to be aware. 


                         <br><br>


So, what you, me, can do? Well, first, live happy. Spend time with your loved ones and do what you love to do. Be nice to people around you and live a life that maximizes your personal value. But, remember, don’t waste time, just like how you shouldn’t waste any food. Second, start from small actions that guard the earth. I want you to ride bikes more frequently because it’s fun and keeps you in a good shape; I want you to eat a vegan diet, because that keeps you healthy especially in your 60s; I want you to buy less no matter how much you earn because they’re not necessary and makes your life messy; Stop wasting food and starting compost, not only because it harms the environment but also think how some people don't even have food to eat…Third, educate the future generation just as how we’re educated by Ken; Let them know how climate change is caused and how it impacts our lives. Remember, there is one and only earth on which we can live. Also, let them know we have to treat everyone on the earth with a kind heart and everyone should be treated equally. When you and your kids see people in need, share what you have with them…


                         <br><br>

I’ll do best my to guard the earth, and when it’s your turn, I wish you can do even more. Live happy and make the Earth a better place!



                         <br><br>

Best Wishes!

To whoever might read this in the future:
                         <br><br>

 Hi there, believe or not this is a letter from 2020, and I’m a college student who is taking a class about the climate crisis. Climate crisis is the top concern problem at this time, and I hope by the time you are reading this it things are under control and you are also trying hard to protect our environment like we are doing now. It takes us a lot of effort to achieve what you are living now so value it and do not make the same mistake again.
                         <br><br>

 We did a lot of things since we realized climate change, such as reducing the burning of fossil fuels, walk or ride bikes instead of driving cars, eat plant-based diets and reduce eating beef and dairy products, minimizing things we have, buy less clothes, having no more than two kids, move to small houses instead of big houses, collect carbon tax, and most importantly, voting. Among all these things, I especially put in actions for not buying too many clothes. I used to be obsessed with buying clothes, but after I learned that the true cost of buying clothes is way more "expensive" than we think I rarely buy new clothes now. The tons of clothes we are producing are undecomposable, and the clothes we are donating eventually go back to those developing countries who made them, which form a vicious circle. Though not everyone is doing all these things but I see more and more people are influenced by people like climate activists and are following their actions. The person influenced me the most is my climate class professor Ken. He told us he walks to school every day though he does not live close to school, and I do saw him walking on the streets a few times. He once said, “I’m here to apologize for my generation” and this sentence is a warning to me, I can’t just live the present, I need to do things for the future as well.
                         <br><br>

 Anyways, my point is that our generation sacrifices a lot to make changes, and you must keep doing not for your own but also for the next generation. I believe, though the problem is not fully solved right now, the situation will get better and better and eventually be solved after the efforts of generations and generations together.
                         <br><br>

Sincerely,
                         <br><br>

A Letter To Myself-                          <br><br>

 I write this letter as a list of promises I make to myself, my future family, and mother earth, to hold myself accountable for what I believe in. I write this as a guide to myself for when I feel lost, tired, or defeated with the weight of the climate crisis. 
                          <br><br>
 Number One- I promise myself that I will try, every day, to be more cognizant about my impact and choices. Whether it be what to eat, what to buy, where to go, or the many other decisions I make on a daily basis, I need to remember that I need to think for more than myself. As small as it may seem, my actions make a difference and can impact the choices of the people around me.
                         <br><br>
 Number Two- I promise myself that I will fight for this planet. Social change is one of the biggest factors holding us back from making change in climate policy. I will go to every march, rally, and environmental rally that I can and make my voice heard. I will get involved with environmental groups on and off campus, because I believe action comes with partnership. 
                         <br><br>
 Number Three- I promise myself I will make green policy one of my leading factors in making political decisions. I believe the only possibility we have for successfully mitigating climate change is to push for large scale change to current society through policies and regulations. Whether it be engaging other citizens in climate issues through lobbying or casting my vote for a policy, I will show up and stand out in this democracy. 
                         <br><br>
 Number Four- I promise myself to frame my environmental journey in how it can benefit me. If I focus too much on my action in the scope of saving the planet, it can be depressing. However, I learned from this class was that being environmentally friendly can help you live a better life. I can be more connected with the land, food, and community around me, while aligning my actions with my principles. I believe if I focus on this, I can make the changes I want to in my life.
                         <br><br>
 Number Five- I promise to take this crisis seriously. Every day, new statistics come out telling us about how climate change is speeding up and becoming more devastating than ever before. People read it, post it to their instagram story, seem to care for 5 minutes, and then go back to their lives. I hope by the time you are reading this, that has changed. I promise to never act this foolishly. I promise to keep myself informed, updated, and prepared.
                         <br><br>
 So that's it for now. I have faith in myself to do the right thing and push for a better future. I hope that looking back on this, I can be proud of the choices I made and the societal changes made. Even though the picture ahead looks bleak, I believe that we as a society can change. In 2019 alone, we’ve seen a new push for climate action among citizens and politicians, for example the Green New Deal pushed for by politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and policy on climate change has become a platform that the candidates for the 2020 election must weigh in on. In the next few years, we can grow on this progress and make real, structural change. I can only hope that things have changed, the people on this planet have changed, for the benefit of humanity and all life on Earth. I hope that looking back on this, I am right.

With the upcoming presidential election, I am hopeful we can start getting some change done. If we are able to elect someone capable of passing laws that will benefit out environment then we will be one step closer to fixing what we have done. I think as a species we have raised more awareness to our current climate crisis than ever before. Yes, it has been talked about for years even decades before now, but somehow our generation has made it a priority to properly inform everyone about what is happening around us. Although I think we have done a great job doing this, we have so much more to do and I am hopeful we will accomplish it. We need to continue spreading awareness along with the truth on climate change, as well as being the change we need to see. By this I mean we need to make different life choices in order to help slow down the ever-rising climate. These choices can start off small like giving up beef, then becoming vegetarian, and ultimately vegan. The point is we do not need to cut off all bad thing’s cold turkey, no we need to adjust properly in a way that we will stick with for the rest of our lives. There are many things we as individuals can do including having less children, walking or biking to places we need to go if needed we can use public transportation like busses and trains to get around. We can make our homes more environmentally friendly by installing low flow water systems, double paned windows, solar panels, and so much more. Another thing everyone should start doing is becoming zero waste, this is essential because the more this becomes the norm the more companies will have to start adapting. This means by in bulk, bring your own containers to stores, and try to limit the amount of single use plastics and packaged foods as possible. The less waste you create during the day the better. Once we have slowly but surely eliminated everything in our lives that are creating unnecessary waste and energy then we can start pressuring large corporations to do the same. Big corporations like Amazon, Walmart, Disney, and oil companies are the main reasons why we are in the state we are in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Their practices, shipments, production, waste, packaging, and everything you can think of all contributes to the reason why our planet is dying. Our oceans are becoming hotter and subsequently more acidic which is killing off marine life, oil spills pollute the water while also killing many species including birds. Plastic from various companies get consumed by marine life, chokes them to death, or ends up floating somewhere in the water to be forever lost. I would like to note that these are just the things happening to our oceans, there is so much more happening on land all around the world due to these types of corporations. If we do not find a way to stop and limit the things they are doing then in 40 years I see no future. I do not want to even try to imagine what our lives and beautiful planet would look like if nothing changes because it will be devastating. The way I like to explain it to others is through this comparison. Imagine your favorite place as a kid, let’s use Six Flags New Orleans as the example, it was fun and full of exciting things. Oh, you don’t remember six flags in Louisiana. That’s because it shut down after Hurricane Katrina hit. Now I could go on to say how hurricane Katrina could have been influenced by climate change, but for the sake of my point I will leave it at that. Six Flags New Orleans is now abandoned, at one point in life this was a place for friends and families to get together and enjoy the park, but now it is depressing, vandalized, and broken. You can look online to see what the park once looked like, but your also shown pictures of what it looks like now, a side by side comparison is shocking because how does something so magical turn into what appears like a pile of garbage? Well at the rate we are going this is what our future looks like. In 40 years, our great grandkids will be looking up photos of what our planet used to look like and ask us what it was like. We will have to explain how and why earth is the way it is now all because humans could not change our selfish ways. Now I hope our future does not turn into an abandoned amusement park, but it is clear now that if you ignore something long enough, it will turn to rubble. Six Flags New Orleans closed in 2005, it only took 15 years of negligence and trespassing vandals to turn it into what it is today. Therefore, we need to not give up on our planet and we need to come together like we never have before to right the wrongs of our past. The time is now, I hope 40 years from now I can read this and smile because we were able to accomplish our goal of saving the earth. And or laugh at myself for thinking the planet could ever look like an abandoned theme park, either way I really hope our generation made a difference, instead of contributing to the problem.

The year is 2060, and I am now 59 years old, an age I might not have thought I would make it to,  by the time you read this your children will most likely be older than you are writing this, it's almost crazy to write that. As I write this, it's a bittersweet experience as I fear for the future but so look forward to the amazing wonders adulthood will bring me, and the hopeful joys of becoming elderly as i/you am now. Of course you know all that has happened and all that you are now, one of my hopes is that I was able to make a difference. Grow out of my selfish youth and go onto educate the young and hopefully make some impact in their life. 
                         <br><br>


As you know, I'm writing this for you at the request of my English course, an interesting assignment and I write to you in hopes that you can loo upon yourself as you were in this moment, and that everything I hope to do and achieve will happen, even in some miniscule way. I hope that the democrats take back the house and make as much change as possible, especially concerning the climate. I hope actual law and legislation actually passes so that my children can live in a world not dominated byt he fear of the future and their own childrens future. Maybe its my naietivity wishing this but I want others to grow up in a world where there has been change and I will be happy. I hope you have made yourself in to a successful and helpful tecaher in educating them not only in your subject, but in life and give them a hint to what it will be. All i want is to have  asafe and secure future for yourself and our future generations.

It's finals week, Winter quarter 2020 at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I completed my undergraduate degree. I'm sitting at the library, my normal 1st floor spot, and writing this letter in a world of terror, anxiety, and fear, as the coronavirus (COVID19) is taking over, making our Dead and Finals week all online and for transitioning the entire start of the following spring quarter online as well.  This fear I feel right now about this virus only feed more into the fear I've had this whole quarter learning about climate change. To sum up my feelings: I'm disappointed with the inefficient steps we've been taking and terrified that we won't fix our mistakes. With climate change, my mind is always on a roller coaster. Sometimes, I'm hopeful, and think about all the good in the world and how someone is bound to hear the loudest voices, but other times, I'm so utterly distraught, reasoning that the voice of reason will never be the loudest above the scream of fossil fuel industry, corruption, and greed. I wanted to write this letter to my future self and to my kids (again, if that pans out) showing the dichotomy of what goes on in my brain. 
                         <br><br>


Let's start with the bad. It's 2060, disease has hit our planet multiple times, summers are getting unbearable as temperatures rise and never seem to fall back down, and our government has chosen to do nothing at all to hold each other accountable in the Paris Agreement. Climate change just has never been our priority and it shows in how much suffering we have felt. Our country never went to renewables, people never explored new energy possibility in the sector. We are just unhappy as a civilization and species. We have all this stuff accumulated, but the disparity just grows. These materials mean nothing to us, but just a collection to show our "wealth" when we remain poor in health, wellness, and being content with our lives. I'm surprised to have survived all the poor conditions for so long, and I just want to say, I'm sorry to my kids for all the terrible actions of those in my generation. I'm sorry we all spoke but no one listened. I can't say it'll change in your generation, but what I can say is, keep trying. Don't live your life complacently, because what makes you different is that you tried and did everything you could to bring power back in your hands. 

                         <br><br>

I hope that this previous paragraph is far from what happens. It is a manifestation of my biggest fears and brings me only sorrow. Let's put some positivity into the universe. The government shift to renewable energy has lifted such a weight off of the country's energy debt. I'm glad that people are now realizing that they only need a few things to be happy in life and that they should be living and eating cleanly in order to be happy. I'm excited to see how people now think it's cool to be living better. It's truly shown how happy people are, and it's infectious. We've finally learned our lesson. 
                         <br><br>


I don't know what the future holds. All I do know is that I can try my best to fight for what I believe. I think our diets should be flexible and should be mindful of the climate, emphasizing a cleaner, plant based diet, with lower amounts of beef. I think we should live humbly and modestly, never having too much unnecessary stuff, but a few things that we cherish and use daily. I think we should focus efforts on community gardening and community building. I'm excited to see what other new, innovative initiatives we can come up with together. Let's keep going.

A Message From the Future

                         <br><br>

The year is 2060.  It seems like yesterday that I experienced the crazy year that was 2020, especially because without that year there is no way the world would look as it does today.  The rainforests have been restored, the human population is stable, once endangered species are now safe.  Fossil fuels are illegal, roads have been replaced with bike lanes, public transportation is now as popular as consumerism was back in 2020.  It’s crazy, because when it began, I thought 2020 was going to be a complete disaster.  I had just started school at UCSB when coronavirus first popped up.  At first, I did not think anything of it; it seemed like something that would be rapidly contained and have a minimal impact on the human population.  However, shortly after the primary presidential election, the virus had spread to nearly the whole world.  Entire countries were on lockdown, people were getting infected by the second, and UCSB transitioned to an online spring quarter.

                         <br><br>

When this happened, I remember feeling a great sense of unease.  I still was not too worried about the virus as I was told my generation was safe from the illness; I was more worried about having to be home for the entirety of spring quarter.  I had just switched dorm rooms, was finishing up my online finals, and calling everyone I knew to see if I could live with them for the rest of the year.  Eventually, I headed home and made it about two weeks before deciding to spend the rest of the quarter in the mountains.  It was absolutely incredible; I hiked parts of the Pacific Crest Trail I had only dreamt of.  I truly learned what it was like to live in solidarity, completely at one with the earth.  However, I was not aware that the world around me was completely collapsing as I was enjoying the beauty of nature.

                         <br><br>

In June of 2020, I emerged from the wilderness after having minimal human contact for several months.  Although I was somewhat aware of the changes occuring throughout the globe, I was not prepared for the rate at which it had happened.  Every major company was shut down, no large events were being held, the entire world was practically on quarantine.  It was absolutely insane; humanity was forced to return to a more natural state of existence, coexisting with natural life instead of acting superior to it.  Communities became closer, many wars ended, and people started to remember why the earth was so important.  Globally, billions of people realized they were happier with this simple state of being and committed to minimalism, owning only the basics and borrowing or sharing when needed.  I joined this and have been living as a minimalist for the last forty years.
                         <br><br>


In the 2020 election, Trump was massively defeated by the democratic party and was kicked out of office.  With an amazing lead from the new president, the United States became pioneers of sustainable living, drastically reducing carbon emissions and inspiring other nations to do the same.  With so much of the world shut down, people eagerly contributed by planting trees and growing fruits and vegetables and herbs.  The consumerist culture fell by the wayside, quickly replaced by thrift and second hand stores.  Overall, the world experienced a massive revolution.
                         <br><br>


Once coronavirus died down, many people were disappointed to return to their old way of living.  Many of my parent’s friends decided to quit their jobs and continue to spend time with the community and furthering their own interests.  The majority of people realized they were a lot happier living with a lot less and dismantled their old way of life to pursue a more sustainable way of living for them and the planet.  As for me, I went back to school in the fall and graduated three years later with a bachelor’s in psychology.  Throughout my life, I have watched the planet return to its natural state.  I have visited the rainforests and glaciers and seen several species that almost went extinct; when I took my kids to see the glaciers, they were even more intact than when I saw them as a teenager.  The natural earth is preserved and considered the most precious luxury of the human species.
                         <br><br>


It is crazy to think that none of this would have happened without coronavirus, once thought to be the biggest disaster in hundreds of years.  In my opinion, it was the earth’s last warning to change our way of living before it was too late.  I am so grateful we chose to heed that warning and can continue to seek residence on the beautiful planet we call home.

In 2020, I took climate crisis 101 and became aware of human's impact on the planet and learned multiple things we can do to mitigate the crisis. I learned not only technological solutions but more importantly cultural and societal problems that are preventing us to make a move and how we can overcome those problems. As the course ended, I was convinced that the world will be doomed unless we start to take actions. A strong sense of urgency and anxious took over me as I saw no large scale changes in people and feel helpless to only take actions myself.
                         <br><br>

Few years later, as natural disasters and financial costs to fix them increased, policies on stopping the climate crisis had finally been made and enforced strictly in all around the world. We stopped being so materialistic and unhappy. Instead, we adapted a much simpler and happier lifestyle where we focus on bonding with members within our community. It took us some time but we finally let go of the obsession with materials.
                         <br><br>

Just as there is time delay on seeing the affects of fossil fuel burning in the 1960s, there is time delay in seeing the results of changing our lifestyle. As be became simpler, the natural disasters kept occurring as the planet needed time to calm down. This boosted the confidence in some who were against the change to the simpler lifestyle and claimed it won't work. However, as we all know this was our last chance to save the planet, the majority of us kept living the simple life and the planet was able to be peaceful again.
                         <br><br>

Recently, as the planet calmed down and the crisis doesn't seem to be that urgent, the industry of completely environmental friendly technology has boomed. Scientists are working on stuffs we can use to make our life a bit easier but don't hut the planet at all. 
                         <br><br>

I think the climate crisis has taught us human race a big lesson and for a long time we won't do anything to hurt the planet.

Dear Future Self,
                         <br><br>

The year is 2060. I have no clue if the earth is still inhabitable at this point. I'd be surprised to see if we pulled off the discontinuation of climate crisis. Sure, we had tons and tons of people taking action against this battle during my youth, but not quite enough to reverse the damage that has been done in decades before me. A very crucial time for our society took place during the Industrial Revolution. It paved the way for how our world works. Let's take the steam engine for example. The steam engine revolutionized the way technology was invented. We were no longer using clean and renewable sources of energy and transitioned to mainly using coal which is a main cause of greenhouse gases. Before the steam engine, we used renewable energy that is promoted today as a solution to this battle against climate crisis. If only we can back to using eco-friendly resources just as easily.
                         <br><br>

Growing up during this time of the climate crisis, I have realized how important my impact on the world is whether or not I believe it. The smallest changes can make the biggest difference when it comes to my footprint on the earth. Throughout this course taught by Ken, I have made both, large and small changes to my life that have not only benefitted myself and my health, but has also benefitted the earth. Some of the biggest changes I have made since the start of this course have been the reduction of meat I consume, fast fashion, and CO2 emissions. I am highly cautious of my habits and what the repercussions will then follow. I want to know deep down in my heart that I did my part to prevent the world from becoming uninhabitable in just a few decades to come. 
                         <br><br>

One recommendation that Ken stated was to limit the amount of children you have. Unfortunately I cannot say I will limit the amount of pregnancies I will have due to climate crisis, but I can definitely rest assure you that I will raise my many children in a productive manner regarding an eco-friendly lifestyle. I will also make it a priority of mine to make sure my children have the mentality of living a minimalist life and being conscientious of their carbon footprint.

The year is 2060, a year like any other.  This year I look forward to celebrating my 59th birthday, and with another year under my belt, I like to look back on the past and what it was like back in 2020.  Back then was when the mounting problems of the complex climate crisis issue truly became an issue that the world was worried about.  We would look around, unsure of what was to become of this planet, and unsure if we had what it takes to make the necessary changes to preserve a world for future generations.  There was much debate with Democrats in full support of the Green New Deal, pushing for it to be passed and sweeping changes to be made.  Fossil fuel interests fought their hardest and they put up a very tough fight.  Climate denial was made a rampant issue, but with the efforts of my generation, a generation of climate vanguards, we were able to overcome this obstacle.  Despite our low voter turn out in the primary elections, we came in full force during the November elections.  We saw the chance, and we took it.  We educated not only each other on the issues at hand and the various solutions people can implement to combat the climate crisis, but also all other generations.  We made it known that the climate crisis is here, it is destructive, and everyone has the power to make a difference.
                          <br><br>

With all of this effort, my generation was able to be the change we want to see in the world and taught others to do the same.  Therefore, not only did we have my generation backing the vital legislation for sweeping change, but those of other generations stepped up to the plate and delivered the home run that this planet needed, the election of a candidate who would provide the United States with the sweeping cultural changes that we need.  No longer would we be stuck in the era of destructive economic growth, inequality, and environmental destruction among other things, and instead we moved to an era of degrowth, equality, climate justice, and the movement we needed to make changes to preserve the world for future generations.
                          <br><br>

In this moment, education swept the nation and people we correctly informed about the climate crisis, how it was being anthropogenically caused, and what we as humans could do to minimize our impact.  Without the influence of the powerful fossil fuel interests overpowering science, the truth became a widely known fact and people were able to see what was really going on.  The Green New Deal was another integral part of this sweeping cultural change because once educated, people were provided with the framework of how to proceed and ensure that they were able to make the best positive impact possible.  Industries, such as the fuel industry, were redone, eliminating fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energies.  This process has taken years, but it has been worthwhile change that provides humans with sustainable energy sources.
                          <br><br>

Another change was the diet of humans.  Prior to the sweeping changes made, people ate way too much meat and they were wasting the majority of the food that was produced.  Later, people switched over to plant based diets as they are able to provide great nutrients and health benefits, while vastly reducing people’s climate impact.  As for food waste, people began growing more of their own food, really developing a connection with it.  With this, they used every part of the food they produced whether it was eating it or composting it in order to use as nutrients to help the growth of their food.  The destructive monocropping farms were a thing of the past and people built a connection with what they grew.  They grew a variety of plants with different uses, such as medicinal plants, fruit trees, berry bushes, root vegetables and so many more.  It was a time of true change, and this change was beautiful.
                          <br><br>

Also with the decline and eventual minimization of the fossil fuel industry, government funding into car infrastructure declined, with the rise of funding for mass public transportation.  People no longer would drive their cars everywhere and anywhere as this funding allowed for the vast improvement of public transportation, especially trains, where across the US the technology that we already had was implemented and available for all.  People were also able to ride their bikes safely places and this was now the new norm.  Those who had cars stood out, but even then, those vehicles were electric vehicles that had been specially made to minimize their production impact and they were run by solar panels.  This application of technology that we had already discovered became commonplace and a rising movement starting in 2020.  With all of this improvement of the transportation of the US, people stopped flying around the US as the trains were a much less expensive option that was just as fast.  The slow travel movement also gained traction as people started riding bikes more, and taking trains and buses.  People also tended to live near to where they worked, therefore allowing them a short commute for them to ride their bikes.
                          <br><br>

Another component of the changes made in 2020 was equality.  For so long had men and women been treated differently and offered different opportunities.  However, now, they were offered the same opportunities that were ensured through the cultural changes made in response to the climate crisis.  Women and men were now offered equal education, they got paid the same wages for completing the same job, and women were informed about their right to their body and access to contraception.  Women now had the real opportunity to be whatever they wanted to be without facing all of the difficult hardships as suffered by women in the past.  Now, with women gaining positions of power in this country, young girls were able to see who they could be and the potential they had for achieving great things.
                          <br><br>

And last but not least, in 2020 the American Dream and what it means to be happy was redefined.  No longer were people looking for meaning and worth in money and the stuff they could buy.  People now were learning about how with less, their lives can be more meaningful.  With this, people downsized their homes, some moved to cities, or some moved into cohousing with others.  As for the stuff they had, people turned towards the minimalism movement and only had the things that had value to them and were their favorites.  People became happier and it showed as the US moved up in the standings for happiest countries in the world.  Making these simple changes in how they lived their lives, people found community, meaning in what they did, and happiness in the important things.  There was no longer wasteful shopping sprees because people were sad or buying meaningless stuff in order to fill space in their homes.  People acted with meaning and intent and this mentality allowed for people to become happier.
                          <br><br>

All I can say is that looking back on what life was like in 2020 really reminds me of how this was the beginning of an era of change.  This was the movement that our planet needed and it couldn’t have come at a better time, with just the right conditions, it was able to spark a climate revolution and in the end, this is what preserved a world for future generations.  This year we look to celebrate the 40th anniversary of this revolution and continue to practice our climate conscious ways so as to ensure a sustainable future where not only the people of the US are happy and sustainable but so is the world.  Once the US made all these changes, it led the world as a developed country making strides towards the solutions that we had to see in order to save our planet.  Other countries followed suit and developed countries then helped those undeveloped countries with any issues or growth they desired to achieve in a sustainable manner.  With the world changed and a world saved for future generations I look back with great pride knowing that I was part of the generation that was able to change the world and achieve a climate friendly path we continue on today.

My children, before there was all this destruction, this struggle, and this farce within the world, there was a time…. A time where happiness and prosperity ruled. 
                          <br><br>
Many decades ago, humanity was at its peak. People had the freedom to travel anywhere they wanted, eat and drink however much they liked, and could even choose their jobs or work! During this era, Democracy reigned supreme, as it guaranteed any man or woman the right to live whatever lives they wished. People could drive cars to the places they wanted, buy the most delicious food, and even buy the most blissful of items. Life was like this for many, many years, even before my time, until it started to become ugly, as all good things do. As more people were being born into the world, and the more Capitalism and Democracy spread, the world too started to drive anywhere they wanted, eat the most delicious food, and own any item they wanted. Soon the entire globe became enveloped in this way of life, and soon, we would pay the price for it. It didn’t take long for some to notice that disaster was coming. That the divine way of life would soon crumble. But the leaders around the world didn’t listen. Instead they let the problem fester, as the Earth slowly suffered the consequences. By the time people started to wake up and realize that our lavish way of life needed to end, it was too late. Powerful storms started to wreak havoc on our country. The oceans rose to engulf homes, communities, and even cities. The final blow, however, was when the capitalistic system collapsed. The massive conglomerate rose so high, yet it fell even harder. Once the stock market crashed, pure panic thrust our country into a state of anarchy. It was chaos, much like today, before our new government took over. Ran by the military, resistance stood no chance, and the order took back against the mayhem that was created. Soon, our overlords owned every aspect of our lives, and resistance was futile. While our Earth is slowly healing today, it comes at the cost of our own lives. Our food is sanctioned, we cannot travel anywhere, and every aspect of our lives is built around efficiency. While the world heals, this is how we must live, as we should have many years ago…

The year is 2060, and my how things have changed.
                          <br><br>


Back in 2020, I was a freshman in college, and didn't quite know what I wanted to do with my life, which was pretty normal for my age. A lot of the people I was surrounding myself happened to care a lot about the planet, which is something I'd obviously always cared about, but never really thought about protecting. It wasn't until I got to school at UCSB that I really started to feel passionate about protecting our great earth. I decided to take a class in my second quarter called The Climate Crisis. Let me just be brief in saying it did a lot for me. At the same time, I discovered how much I deeply loved the outdoors. Growing up in Seattle, our summers were beautiful, but the rest of the year, it was hard to be outside sometimes due to the weather. Because of this, I didn't get to truly appreciate the great benefits of being outside so much of the time. Living in Santa Barbara, though, I got to experience it in the most beautiful place. This newfound love coupled with the climate class really showed me that we needed change, and we needed it quick.
                          <br><br>


I never fully understood why people were so hesitant to make change. I know it's crazy sounding now, but a lot of people didn't believe in climate change back then. Despite whether they believed in it or not, they should've been okay making positive changed for the environment regardless. Even if we weren't killing it, which we were, there's no reason why we can't at least be nicer to it. So that was a struggle we had to overcome together. Honestly, it was around this time that I was starting to get really fed up with the US. We simply had no regards for how our greedy actions were leaving the rest of the world in turmoil. I'm happy to say that at this point in time, 2060, we've truly achieved a global friendship. The world should've been able to get along this whole time, because it's truly better for everyone, but we haven't always been like this. Anywho, it was then that I also decided that traveling was something that I needed to do, but also I didn't want to be flying everywhere, so it was a bit of an issue. Fortunately enough, it was soon after that we developed the most high speed and environmentally friendly train system, which made travel more plausible. 

                          <br><br>

So we finally got people on board. It was a movement towards climate protection, and we had full force. By the time we got everyone invested, we really had to work quick, and that we did. People overhauled their lifestyles for the planet. Obviously not everyone, there were still people who were too stubborn to stop eating beef and such, but the majority of people made enough change to save the planet, and make it a livable place for all the future generations. I don't know about you, but I can't even imagine eating beef anymore. Now, farm animals aren't raised for slaughter. So we changed our food habits. We also changed our transportation habits, as I mentioned with the high speed trains, but also with a decrease in cars. A fad came around soon after 2020 that put electric bikes at the top of everyone's list, and thus cars went out the window, and thank goodness for that. The next step was changing the mindset of Americans. We had to somehow get everyone back to their roots, and realize that luxury didn't mean happiness. Materialism was reaching an all time high, and not only was it detrimental to the planet, but to peoples' wellbeing as well. It was a false happiness that Americans were obsessed with chasing. But again, we did it. It took a LONG time and a lot of effort, but thanks to our amazing activists, we got, again, the majority, back to square one. We realized that life is so much better when we're all more equal, and once we'd established that is when we got into a more friendly relationship with all the other countries. We lent out a hand to the struggling countries, and got us all on the same page.
                          <br><br>


Along with all of the positive change happening down on earth, we were also expanding quickly in our space exploration. The universe is so vast that we knew there had to be other inhabitable planets out there, and that there must be other life as well. And we were right. It's nothing as crazy as the stories we were told as kids about aliens, but it was pretty spectacular when we discovered the first life. Obviously, we couldn't communicate at all, but we're making progress with that. We did also find other planets that we could live on, which we thought we'd need for a little at the height of the climate crisis, but luckily we saved our own planet so we didn't have to, but people are starting to consider moving to another one. It's very cool, honestly, the idea that the human race could be on not just earth. You have no idea how many cool jobs we have now, too. I think that the climate crisis actually ended up being a good thing, because it did so much in the long run to the benefit of the human race. We shook our materialism, made friends with the rest of the world, discovered new life in space, and created a vast network of new jobs that people actually enjoy doing. I'd say we definitely came out the other side happier. I hope we never face another climate crisis, but I can't say I don't think we could handle it if it were to arise again.

This is you in 2060. It's a late suggestion. Now the world's few remaining natural resources have been polluted and can no longer be used. All of this is because there are too few people willing to protect the resources and  environment. I also agree that many people in the world used to think about how to protect the environment and reduce carbon emissions by doing small things. But when it comes to big plans, many people will think that it's too time consuming and energy consuming, and the little things we each do will not have much impact on the overall human behavior, so not many people are willing to reduce their own carbon emissions to protect the environment, but to be honest, there are many small things we can do, and these things will not affect It will affect our life, but if everyone does this little thing, it will reduce a lot of carbon emissions. For example, from my point of view, I can choose to travel by bike rather than by car when the distance is not far away. Then, when the distance is not very long and the time is not very urgent, choose to travel by train instead of by plane. Then, try to eat more vegetable based food and less beef without affecting your mood. And it's very interesting. We can also call on other people in the community to join us in this way and advocate carbon emission reduction. That's what we can do. If more people were willing to protect the environment at that time, the world's environment would not be as bad as it is now. There would not be enough clean water to maintain life, and the air would smell bad. If I knew it would turn out like this, I would certainly appeal to more people at that time for the importance of protecting the environment.

This message is from human 2893289:
                             <br><br>
  Hello and good day from the year 2060. You might find it hard to believe, but there is still life on Earth today...though it’s circumstances may not be ideal. Compared to the early 2000s, our planet is almost entirely submerged under water as now 90% of Earth's surface area is now ocean. We weren't quick enough to stop the rapidly escalating climate crisis before it caused too much damage to our poles leading to an excess in sea level rise and and more warmth being absorbed into our oceans. The land that we do inhabit is overcrowded and can barely sustain its occupants. Despite the efforts of the climate activists to push for renewable energy, most countries chose a short cut. Their answer: nuclear power plants. Environmental racism still exists as most of our power plants are located in residential areas that housed poor minority groups. Although we haven't experienced too many spills of the nuclear waste, it's evident that the chemicals are affecting our environment and people. More and more cases are coming up where children are being born with side effects you could probably only imagine; I will spare you the details, but know that these situations are nightmareish. I once had hope that humanity would come together and realize the seriousness of the climate crisis, but was ultimately proven wrong. The world powers did nothing meaningful to help its people and now we are reaching an inevitable end to the human race. I wish for mother nature to take over after we have gone but sadly I think she left us a long time ago. I have nothing left to say besides don’t give up, you have your chance but you have to act now, you need to fight harder for your future or you will end up where I am now. Don’t wait. Please.

I first became aware of the climate crisis in 2016, my freshman year of high school. It was at this time that I was first introduced to Thoreau's Walden, but just like most high school freshman I could not vote, did not know what to do, and as such didn't really think much of it. In reality, I felt lost. 

                             <br><br>

About a year later was the climate rally in Oceanside San Diego. Talks of banning plastic straws and other single use plastics began to spark up. Furthermore, a mandatory 2 month climate unit was incorporated into the schedule of every Junior and Senior at my school. Although I was a sophomore at the time, I began to do some research and began thinking more about trash and tried my best to reduce my own waste. I began buying less stuff, avoiding takeout, and some other smaller changes like turning the shower off while I soaped.
                             <br><br>


During junior year of high school, we were the first class in my school to take this new climate pathway so in a way there was a lot of pressure on us to become invested in it. Overall, I don't know if it was because we were the first class or because the teacher seemed upset to be mandated to teach this new unfamiliar unit, but I felt like I got very little out of it. I learned a lot of statistics about the climate change and that things needed to change, but without having the slightest clue on how to change them.

                             <br><br>

Senior year was when I started to become informed on how to take change. Some volunteers on animal rights and planetary justice came to speak to us about the gruesome conditions that livestock live in and the negative impacts that the dairy and beef industry has on our ecosystem. It was at this time that I first started transitioning to a largely plant based diet. It was a slow start, switching from hamburgers to spaghetti and meat sauce (which contains 1/5 of the beef content) and eventually switching that out to marinara and chicken and then simply marinara, but by the time I finished high school I was on a largely plant based diet. It was also during this year that a great leap was taken, Styrofoam was banned in San Diego and any form of single use disposable plastic, including straws and bags was outlawed in California.

                             <br><br>

Freshman year of college, I took English 23, this course expanded my knowledge on the climate crisis exponentially and convinced me that the best way to fight the climate crisis was through political action and activism. While taking this course I voted for the first time in my life and for a pro-climate candidate at that. I voted for Bernie Sanders at the presidential primary, a known climate warrior and for several local officials who promised to do things such as restrict the implementation of new offshore drilling facilities and reduce the amount of parking spots available.
                             <br><br>
Despite our best efforts, president Trump was re-elected which unfortunately meant 4 more years of no climate action.

                             <br><br>

During those 4 years we had 2 more super storms costing the US thousands of lives and trillions of dollars in damages. Climate activism grew and with it a demand for change from the public. In 2024, a Democratic candidate, inspired by Bernie won the presidential election. Adopting a similar platform as Bernie, he was able to put the Green New deal in motion and join the Paris agreement with amendment for more concrete guidelines. In 2026, the Democrats took back several senate seats after pressure from several heavily climate change affected swing states such as Florida and Maine, but republicans still held majority at 50-48-2. 

                             <br><br>

Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez was elected as house speaker in 2028 and upon the democratic reelection of our 46th President, we introduced the first global carbon tax on gasoline and oil in 2029. It was a groundbreaking decision with a tiebreaker vote needed from the vice president in the senate. Additionally, the federal transportation budget was re-adjusted to cut funding for roads and implement new infrastructure such as high-speed rail and bus-only lanes. Rather than cutting the military's budget, a compromise was made with the republicans to mobilize our military force for climate action. Missile and satellite testing facilities were refitted to track atmospheric CO2 and ground temperatures from the stratosphere, the corps themselves were put into action in reforestation and habitat restoration efforts, and former experimental chemical and bomb facilities were began researching new renewable energy sources including more efficient photo-voltaic panels. 

                             <br><br>

In  2030, the US faced a major trash crisis. With the carbon tax fully in motion and less roads, driving cars became almost impossible for most Americans. This led to cars being abandoned on the shoulder of the streets. Additionally, many energy intensive activities such as flying, air conditioning and machine drying became obsolete. The Military once again absorbed this and metal recycling plants were established across the country. A federal system was put in place where abandoned or donated cars could be turned into windmills. The successful transition into renewables led to public satisfaction which gained the democrats back the senate in 2031

                             <br><br>

With a democratic senate, house, and presidency, the most controversial and difficult change was implemented. Effective in 2032, a decrease in 80% of beef, dairy, and all non-aviary, non-fish animal products was put in place. This was an unpopular but necessary change which cost the democrats the 2032 presidential election, but they still managed to hold on to congress. The results of these changes however were mixed. On the one hand, it led to a massive boom in chicken and duck consumption which have a very low carbon footprint when compared to beef, but on the other it only worsened over fishing. 
                             <br><br>


Seeing over-fishing as a problem, the republican president challenged the new law in the courts. In a landslide decision, it withstood. Having no choice, the new administration put in place a series of strict fishing laws in place with military patrols to enforce them. Although not nearly enough, the US by this point, had managed to cut its carbon footprint to a fifth of what it was in 2020. 

                             <br><br>

With the groundwork in place, the following 10 years were a slow crawl of regulation being slowly passed. New National Forests were established, a biomass cap on livestock was implemented, and renewable energy became more and more prominent. The US faced many natural disasters and lost thousands upon thousands of lives which only reinforced the need for these measures.

                             <br><br>

Now, the year is 2045. I am 44 years old. The US and China have managed to lower their emissions to well below that established on the Paris agreement. The North pole has been lost and the Earth continues to warm, but society continues and with the decrease in emissions there is hope for the future. Models predict that at our current emissions, we might expect sea ice to start forming again in the arctic by 2150. Now the great challenge is to modernize developing countries in an Eco-friendly matter. 

                             <br><br>

To all of you reading in the past, keep fighting. Eventually, it all pays off. Without you, I'm sure I would not have a livable world. So, thank you and take care of our planet.

Dear Future Me,                             <br><br>

Sometime has gone by and I hope that all is well. I hope that you have graduated college, gotten married, bought a house, and have a child or two. However, the real reason i am writing to you is not to catch up. As I am writing this to you I am finishing up the climate crisis class you took your sophomore year of college with Ken Hiltner. Throughout the course of this class I have become very aware of the crisis that our planet is in and that we need to put a stop to it. This attitude that I have regarding climate change is strong and I am wondering if I still feel this way down the line. If so, what did I do to make a change after this class. My goals are to eat less meat, drive less, and buy less clothing/unnecessary things. If you have a child are they going to be safe on this planet once you have died? Has this child been educated on how to live a sustainable and eco-friendly life? These are the thoughts that are going through my head. As of right now, the current state of this world is so poor that I would be scared to bring a child into it in fear that it would potentially see the end of the world. I know that sounds dramatic but it truly is how things are looking. Sea levels are rising and the earth is warming up. I just hope that when I am writing this to you, everything has halted. I hope that whoever is President during your time actually cares about the environment and spends money fixing this issue. I just do not want our child to have to deal with this problem when s/he is older. I want him/her to enjoy their life without the fear of the end of the world.

Dear self,                              <br><br>

It was early March in the year 2020. I was a freshman in college at the University of California Santa Barbara, pursuing a major in Environmental studies. In the United States, the democratic presidential primaries were taking place. My generation, those who were fighting for the protection of the planet were rallying in support of the  Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, because of his major endorsement of the Green New Deal, the first resolution calling for widespread cultural, economic, political and social change to stop the climate crisis. The battle between the two leading Demoratic candidates,  Joe Biden and the democratic-socialist Bernie Sanders wasn’t going as planned. The progressives of my generation thought maybe Americans were finally ready to act on climate change, maybe we were ready for a paradigm shift to completely unroot the American way of life. Sadly, the longer the race went on, it was clear that Democrats were not ready for such sweeping change, it was clear that Joe Biden was going to represent the Democratic party and was going to be our best hope in replacing Donald Trump as the new president of the United States. 

                             <br><br>

But I remember when everything changed. It was late March of the year 2020 when the Coronavirus (COVID-19) was finally recognized as a major national threat. On March 13, 2020, the current president of the United States Donald J. Trump declared a national emergency in the United States, and from that day forward I knew everything was about to change. All over the United States, universities, schools, and almost all organizations were completely shut down in fear of spreading the virus. When we first heard of the virus spreading in China, no one thought this would signal the start of a climate revolution. We were all told that the virus posed no real threat to the US, and that the virus was similar in severity to the common cold or flu, that only the elderly, the sick, and compromised were at risk. 
                             <br><br>


In the following months, millions upon millions of the older generation died from the Coronavirus. As my generation grieved for the loss of parents and grandparents, many of us completely lost track of the presidential election and politics in general. But as it turned out, because of the diminished “boomer” generation, American politics saw a dramatic shift to the left. As the more moderate and conservative elders of our nation were now a minority in the national population, my generation finally had the opportunity to spark the climate revolution. 
                             <br><br>


Bernie Sanders was elected in November 2020 as the new president of the United States. The US rejoined the Paris Accord and eventually advocated for a new international agreement to be made on climate change, one that followed the basic concepts outlined in Alexandria Ocasio Cortez’s Green New Deal. The US entered a period of economic stagnation, allowing for developing countries to boost their economies, ensuring that all of humanity had enough food to eat, a safe place to live, and had everything that they needed to pursue a truly happy life while valuing Mother Earth and her finite resources. Meanwhile the US turned toward a plentitude economic system, creating more jobs, growing the middle class, and reducing workers hours dramatically so that people could practice sustainability and build stronger communities. The US turned to 100% renewable energy, stopped producing single-use plastics, reforested the nation… and the rest of the world was quick to follow in our footsteps. Who knew the planet would be saved by a mysterious virus from China?

Now is the year 2060, and I'm writing this message to you all not on the Earth, but on a spaceship instead. The Earth has been destroyed by human beings due to over mining and the burning of fossil fuels. Although people have known that this action is detrimental to our planet, however, some fossil fuel companies and governments united together to make legislations that were unfriendly to the environment. Because of that, the global temperature rapidly rose to about 4 degrees Celsius on average. Droughts and hurricanes frequently affecting most of the areas, and most of the landmasses became deserts that are unable to grow crops. Like a vicious cycle, animals, including humans, were starving and dying. In order to obtain those limited resources, wars were everywhere around the globe.  Some smart governments knew the situation is not going to be reduced or returned by attending wars, they sent citizens to other planets.

                             <br><br>


My purpose for writing this message is to ask you to act and save our planet NOW in 2020. Although the global climate was already changing, you still can take action and prevent all these from happening if you act NOW! Reduce the consumption of meat, especially beef, and change your diet into a more sustainable one. Drive less and take subways and buses instead. It is going to be too late and there would be no way to regret it in the future if you do not act.

A message from the future:
                             <br><br>

At the start of 2020, about forty years ago, I was a sophomore at the University of California, Santa Barbara and I was taking an English course called Climate Crisis 101. I was 19 just turning 20 still at the start of my adult life, and I learned the importance of the climate crisis and how we needed to act urgently on the matter. I year pry to me taking this course at UCSB freshman House Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a Senator partnered together to introduce the Green New Deal, a plan for how the United States should switch our country away from fossil fuels and towards a greener more climate-friendly country. Learning about the Green New Deal inspired my 800 student class to make some radical changes and actions in order to save a livable future that we are entitled to have just like past generations before us. The difference though between older generations compared to our present younger generations is that we wanted to make a future that was not only benefiting the human race, but all living species currently inhabiting this earth with us. 
                             <br><br>

The first couple of years after 2020 were bleak, let me tell you things got worse before it ultimately got way better. AOC was right, democrats did take back the White House in 2020, but unfortunately not the Senate. It was four years of struggling to get climate legislation passed, and even more protests from younger generations to have a better future than what our parents, grandparents, and great grandparents were handing us. It wasn’t until Governor Gavin Newsom first banned fracking in the state of California in 2022 than in 2023 he passed a climate bill that stated California's goal to have net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2045. To do that he promised to create more jobs, job training, and housing for our homeless and low-income communities. That was the spark this country needed because when 2024 came around the United State elected its first female president of the United States. It was one of the happiest moments of my life, but democrats barely controlled both the House and the Senate with the democrats occupying 54% of the seats in the House and 52% seats in the Senate. This though gave Madam President even to start implementing climate policies right away. First, she implemented Healthcare for All and created new jobs by changing our infrastructure to better public transportation and bike-friendly infrastructure. One of the hardest things to implement was fair trade with our trading parts. That took many years and for most, in the United States, it didn’t seem like it was going to happen. Then finally we were able to help our partners of less developed countries to start implementing their own climate-conscious laws so we can all fairly trade with each other without hurting the environment. 
                             <br><br>

In her second term, Madam President put a tax on carbon and the beef industry which resulted in drastic changes away from any and all products that were connected to them. Currently, my family and I eat a plant-based diet as well as my neighbors and community, and we also support local farms and products. I myself am very proud of how my future has turned out. In my youth, I worked with a private company that used technology to take carbon out of the atmosphere. As of right now, I am nearing retirement and I can proudly say I am optimistic of my children's future and I know without a shadow of a doubt that my daughter and my son can accomplish anything because the people of my generation were able to do grassroots things to ensure our planet could have a livable future. Since our very first woman president I have seen two more women serving 8 years for their country, as well as our first indigenous American president, and Latinx president. 
                             <br><br>

If I could talk to talk to my generation back in 20202, I would let them know that now is the time to fight, and be aggressive, not violent, but aggressive with our actions, if we can’t be heard by the people in government that is meant to represent us then we need to elect better ones that will hear us. We should not have to bear the consequences of actions that we either didn't make or had no control over when they were being made. We also have to know that there is a point of no return when it comes to the climate crisis and we should do everything in our power to not let it get to that point. In conclusion, I would like to thank my generation and the ones that came after because we fought for what we wanted and we were able to achieve it, but we also know that we could never let it get that dier again. Thank you to all of you who stood beside me and fought with me.

Dear friend,                             <br><br>

Long time no see! I know we haven’t spoken for a while, but I just stumbled on some old schoolwork from college, and thought of you. Do you remember when we took English 23 together our 2nd year, Ken Hiltner’s class?? That was almost forty years now, if you can believe it. I’m reading through all of my notes (everything I can make out from my messy handwriting, at least) and it’s all coming back now. The fear, the anger, the disbelief, the motivation we felt to make a difference… I’m sure glad we took what we learned and actually did something. 
                             <br><br>
Back in 2020, we were all so uncertain. Collectively, humanity stood at a crossroads: developed nations could implement a radical plan to change how we lived in order to save us from the worst of climate change’s effects, or we could carry on with business as usual, dooming us. I remember the discussions you and I had in the library after everyone else had gone home, debating whether or not we as a species could actually pull it off within the decade.
                             <br><br>
Back then, it seemed like there were dozens of news articles a day announcing that a new species was endangered, or another community in a developing nation was beginning to face the consequences of our greed and ignorance. These days the news isn’t much cheerier; afterall, the planet is still in recovery… but at least I can sleep at night knowing that the worst is behind us. 
                             <br><br>
The more I think about it, the more I realize that everything Ken taught us was a really helpful guide for the last forty years. I just found a list I wrote down way back then, titled “20 Things that Each of Us Can Do to Save the Planet”, and… wow! You and I along with our entire generation became the leaders of the climate crisis movement by implementing a lot of the solutions on this very list.
                             <br><br>
Just a few years after taking English 23 together, you and I hit the streets along with millions of others in protest of the government’s repeated decision not to pass the Green New Deal. We went door-to-door asking local folks to vote for lawmakers who would support progressive climate policies, and even put our jobs on the line by participating in the National Work Stoppage Strike for the Climate. Those were wild and exhilarating times, but it felt good to be doing something we knew was important, and to be doing it together.
                             <br><br>
Our work finally paid off when congressmen finally felt enough pressure from their constituents that they passed the Green New Deal, which put in motion the craziest period of most young Americans’ lives. The carbon tax quickly curbed fossil fuel use, pushing many people to turn to public transportation. Pressure was once again put on lawmakers, this time to improve buses, trains, and bicycle lanes across the country, and introduce the nation’s first High-speed Rail project. The next wave of change came quickly, as the fossil fuel industry began to collapse, and many Americans were left looking for work. It was rough going for a while in that economy, but just as we suspected, the growth of industries in renewable energy, including solar photovoltaics and wind turbines, quickly took in most displaced workers. 
                             <br><br>
In our own homes, things began to look much different as well. My own growing family could no longer ignore the effects of food waste and other unsustainable eating habits, and so, like many other families, we shifted to climatarian diets. I remember clearly now: English 23 was the first place that I had ever heard of a climatarian diet! Who knew back then that the small movement would soon grow and grow from a niche group, to a popular fad, to being the norm across the globe. Now we eat in-season fruits and vegetables that are grown locally, and largely stay away from meat and most animal products. 
                             <br><br>
It’s strange to think that, although our lives are much different now, we both started our activism journeys in Ken Hiltner’s classroom. In fact, our entire generation shares one experience in common: the exciting, terrifying, and at times wonderful journey to save our planet. I’m sure that you’ll agree with me that even now there is much work to be done, but thank goodness we learned from the inaction of generations before us, and set to work way back in 2020.

To whom it may concern,
                              <br><br>

It is currently the year, 2060. The United States has finally admitted its fault in contributing to the climate crisis. However, the environmental destruction caused by fossil fuel companies has left irreversible damage to our natural ecosystems and atmosphere. The air conditions are very poor, and there is an increase in respiratory disease among the population. Soil conditions are also terrible, making it almost impossible for crops to grow. 
                             <br><br>
I am especially disappointed by oil and petroleum companies for refusing to change their operations and help the environment. Oil and petroleum companies release so much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, warming our earth and creating devastating environmental effects. Accepting that you contributed to climate change is the first step to seeing change. 
                             <br><br>
2020, please acknowledge your fault in contributing to the climate crisis. I know it is a lot easier to throw everything under the rug, but the future generation needs you more than ever. We are suffering, and we don’t know how much longer we can survive without a sustainable food source.

<p>

When looking back to the past, you can’t help yourself recall the memorable moments that brought happiness, personal and cultural growth; this is ever more relevant when discussing the path we, the human race, have come to prioritized when combating the climate crisis of the early 2000s. 
                             <br><br>

It might be helpful to start right from the beginning. In 2001, environmental scientists all came to the conscious that the world was undergoing radical geographical changes due to the ever-increasing climate and furthermore predicted that if nothing was done to minimize the natural greenhouse emissions that were the root cause of climate change, the entire world would feel the repercussions. The consequences varied from acidification of the ocean affecting oceanic wildlife, rising sea levels that would flood coasts all around the world, to higher intensity hurricanes leaving behind a path of destruction and death. Although scientists were setting off the alarms warning people of the reality of the situation, the majority of society deemed it a hoax whereas the rest did not see the immediacy to take action.
                             <br><br>

We flash ten years further down the timeline, where the exact predictions regarding climate change once dismissed were coming to life before our eyes. The acidification of the ocean has largely impacted the coral reef by killing the majority of all coral reefs in the ocean which had devastating implications to the ocean life that depended on the reef for protection and home security. We also witnessed the flooding of villages near bodies of waters in developing countries, these residents then migrated inwards leading to overcrowding and chaos in many cities. The weather forecast also worsened by the hits from Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Andrew and more, that cost millions of dollars worth of damage and the lives of hundreds of people. These were not the only natural disasters that would have these types of effects, wildfires in the United States, Australia, Poland, and other regions have scorched thousands and thousands of acres of land, insinuating everything that came across. Although all the nations were experiencing these catastrophic events, the general public still couldn't connect the link between these natural disasters to the climate crisis. 
                             <br><br>

The movement of awareness and nature conservation was brought about in the 2020s where the youth and politicians began to draw attention to the climate crisis. The establishment of the Green New Deal prompted effective measures to minimize the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel companies and methane from the beef and fracking industry. The carbon tax was also an incentive for the public to minimize their individualistic carbon emissions, therefore promoting a more thoughtful and conscious way of living. Once having a significant impact on culture and society, then infrastructures were created to maximize the amount of electricity being stored so that all countries around the world could have the basic necessity of heat, light, and so forth. A lot of technological advancements have also been put to work to solve the climate crisis, yet it is important to note that everything began with cultural change. 
                             <br><br>

We now live in a better world, than it was decades ago. We see the beauty of nature, we smell the fresh, clean air, as a society we feel healthy and happier, and we have developed a more connected relationship with mother Earth for all of our efforts to save our only home. This is our home, and we will do a much better job of taking care of it.

The anthropocene, previously defined as man's dominant impact on the environment, led to a series of multi-scale problems known as the climate crisis. To succeed in mitigating the effects of Climate Change, urgent and unprecedented collective action is seen as necessary to limit global warming to 2c by 2050 by reducing carbon emissions, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Before his election, Bernie Sanders promised to implement the strategy outlined in the Green New Deal to do what was necessary to mitigate climate change while providing opportunities for economic growth and social justice.
                             <br><br>
To limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, President sanders is calling for a shift in our economy toward energy efficiency and decarbonization, including a rapid transition from fossil fuels as an energy source. Under sanders' leadership, mitigation relies on a multi-pronged approach that expands renewable energy in the nation's infrastructure and funds innovation to improve energy efficiency.
                             <br><br>
To foster innovation and empower the shift, sanders proposed a combination of economic incentives and tough environmental regulations to force the industry to adapt. As industries were forced to comply with these restrictions, companies began to invest in innovation to improve business competitiveness. In addition, by incorporating the cost of ecosystem services into new products, industry has made more prudent use of resources, thus preventing a sharp rise in consumption rates.
                             <br><br>
The dramatic economic shift has not led to mass unemployment or industrial losses that have damaged public livelihoods, as many had feared before Mr Sanders was elected. As President of the United States, Bernie Sanders has prioritized the concerns of social justice by protecting jobs and providing opportunities to adapt and thrive in a changing economy. The "green New Deal" fully considers the interests of individuals and families by ensuring employment, public employment, vocational training and universal health care. Those who work in industries that rely on fossil fuels have experienced a career transition to sustainable industries and new industries that disseminate technological innovation. Those who still need work find jobs in businesses that rely on renewable energy and acquire the necessary adaptation skills through educational opportunities and vocational training.
                             <br><br>
In the end, President sanders became known as the politician who changed the outcome of the climate crisis, leading a social and economic environmental revolution that was one of the world's (formerly) leading emitters of greenhouse gases.

At the beginning of the 2020 decade, I took a life-changing class on climate change. Before this class, I thought I knew all there was to know about the topic, little did I realize as you do now just how serious the crisis has become. Ken, our professor, introduced me to the ideas of personal action and activism, basically, he taught us to take initiative. Before this class, I just blamed a faulty political system and climate deniers for a lack of change, however, this class made me realize that I needed to act alongside others in order to produce any change. So to my future self, here's what I want to do. 
                             <br><br>


During Ken’s course, I took a number of small actions that allowed me to get to where I am today. For starters, around the 4th week of class, I decided to cut out red meat. Around the 7th week, I decided to give the Climatarian diet a shot. This Climatarian diet was new at the time, and it meant little meat and local environmentally-friendly produce. Also, as a 20-year old, I had the power to vote. As I learned in class, voting is one of the most powerful ways to create change. We are privileged to live in a democracy and should always vote when we can. This class convinced me to take voting seriously. I researched candidates and made sure to choose people who were true environmentalists and had a track record to back their word up. Lastly, I started to spread the word about my feelings for the climate crisis. I decided to start actually caring and to talk about the crisis and spread awareness. I no longer feel silly expressing my concern for our planet and taking actions that reflect this concern. 

                             <br><br>

Currently, I’m still a second year in college, still stuck in the dining commons and dorms, and still working towards that CS degree. That being said, I somewhat have a plan for the future. For one, I plan to live a semi minimalist lifestyle. I have learned that stuff isn’t everything, and even if I make a lot of money in the tech world, I don’t need to use it on stuff. Also, as my CS experience grows, I am looking for ways in which I can bring software technology into the environmental world. Software has the ability to both improve technologies that slow the crisis, and technologies that can produce cultural shifts in society. Further, there will be personal changes I need to make. As much as I love driving, I will hopefully use public transport to work. I will also not be flying whenever possible, and definitely won’t be owning a mansion. In the future, I also want to participate in activism. Specifically, I think it would be important to partake in real-life protests and find climate organizations or communities in the bay area to join. One thing I would like to see in the future is for education on climate change to be more widespread. I believe that if everyone knew what I did thanks to Ken’s class, the world could ban together to end the climate crisis. Lack of education is what I believe to be one of our biggest setbacks, and hopefully, I will do something in the future to change that.

                             <br><br>

So to my future self, who will likely be reading this in his 60s. Did I succeed in my goals? Hopefully, I can look back on this assignment, and this class as a whole, and know that it changed me for the better. As easy as it is to ignore this problem, easy is not always right. Life is more satisfying when you take a challenging but fulfilling approach. My plan now is to go down that more challenging road, and hopefully, it brought me lots of happiness.

Hi!                             <br><br>

I know that you are probably thirty or forty while you are reading this. I am 18-year-old you, who has just finished a two-quarter study of UCSB and are quite and inspired and certain about changing lifestyle to a more sustainable and “green” one. Here are some goals that I really wish that I succeeded in when I reach your age.
                             <br><br>

Firstly, having a little garden. I know you are a romantic person since you are a little, but, rather than being romantic and planting roses and lilies in your garden, I hope you can plant some vegetables that you love. I know that buying things from supermarkets is convenient, but you will lose the feeling of having a gift from the soil and the connection with it. Trust me. The feeling of watching those plants growing will be an incredible feeling. I think it would be better if you can generous enough to give some of the vegetables to your neighbors as a gift and try to feel the feeling of offering something that you gained with consistent efforts and the connection with others. You can also have some animals in your garden too. You adopted three homeless cats when you are young. You can do that too in your garden. You don’t even have to buy fertilizer.
                             <br><br>

Secondly, don’t have a baby. I think this is the easiest thing for you to do since you don’t like kids since you are born. Having no children means something more. You will have more time to educate yourself, dig deeper into yourself and find more intrinsic value. You love reading myth. Spend more time in them. You love playing the piano and composing. Spend more time in them. You are a beautiful and powerful woman, and you don’t need a baby to define you or make you whole. (I am not saying having baby is bad.) Just a reminder, in case you will forget this after so many years. Our earth has a maximum carrying capacity. While you were at UCSB, you have learned in EEMB and English class and many other courses, that reaching or exceeding the carrying capacity is a scary thing for a specie. You need to make a contribution towards slowing down the population growth and influence others maybe.
                             <br><br>

Thirdly, try as much as you can to reduce the use of packaging in your life. You can bring your own glass bottles to the shops and filled them. You can bring your own cloth bags to the shops instead of using plastic bags. Go to those food markets, like IV food cooperation, that don’t use plastic wraps to package their goods. This is not limiting your life, this makes your life freer. You don’t have to choose between which pack is better. For example, you can choose whichever the apple you want from the shelf if they are not being packed before putting on the shelf. These little things matter. 
                             <br><br>

Finally, go to travel with bikes. I know you love traveling, but have you ever notice that you need to spend a lot of time in planes and cars while you are traveling. You have never tried traveling by biking because you are too lazy and you think you are not going to make it. However, think about the regrets that left on your European trip because you are in a car and you cannot stop when you saw some stunning views. If you bike, this should not be a problem. Furthermore, the carbon footprints for a long-distance journey is just too much. There is a win-win solution that benefits you and the earth.
                             <br><br>
I hope you have the patent to think about my advice and do it, please.
                             <br><br>

Sincerely.

To My Future Self:

                             <br><br>

The date is March 13, 2020, and the world is amidst a pandemic. Super Tuesday was just 10 days ago and I'm glad to say that Bernie Sanders won the California primaries because he is one of the most progressive democrats concerned with the climate crisis. Being in college during a time when it seems like the odds are against us is tough, yet empowering because it's causing students to get together to find solutions to mitigate the climate crisis and also find power and empathy in solidarity. Even though I’m growing up in a generation that has seen some of the most unprecedented disasters including environmental ones across the globe and social ones like mass shootings and crime, I still feel proud to be apart of this generation because we continue to stay strong together and be resilient in the face of adversity.

                             <br><br>

The norm among many people, but especially young people is to be at least somewhat environmentally conscious. We bring our own bags to stores to avoid the use of plastic and we've made metal straws mainstream to keep plastic straws out of the oceans. Shopping second hand has also been made popular to help ease the harmful effects of fast fashion. Although plastic packaging surrounds us, we try to buy products with biodegradable or no packaging. This is all to say that the climate crisis is prominent in our daily routines and is something we actively try to assuage.
                             <br><br>


During my first quarter at UCSB, I took my first environmental-based class, English 22 which was called “Literature and the Environment.” What would’ve been the first day of lecture was canceled because it happened to be the day of the Santa Barbara Climate Strike. That was the first day I had ever participated in a strike and it was amazing seeing everyone who came out to support and take part in the strike. I held up a huge cardboard sign with a friend that read “NOTHING MATTERS IF THERE IS NO PLANET” while marching down the streets of Downtown Santa Barbara. Because I knew about climate change before the class but had never taken an actual course on it, it was very eye-opening to be taught by Ken. That being said, I had to take his class this quarter and although the politics surrounding climate change are difficult, learning the most I can through this class is so beneficial. I’m an English major and going into UCSB I knew that it would be quite a broad major, but luckily, I found the “Literature and the Environment” specialization. Because of the state of our environment, I feel it’s important to focus my studies on this and hopefully find work after college related to this field. 

                             <br><br>

When I’m 60-years-old, I hope to look back on this year 2020 and say that I did my best. I want to be able to say that I stayed empathetic and found compassion for people, even if I disagree with them. I want to be able to say that our generation is the generation that fueled environmental activism. This is the decade we make a change. I wholeheartedly believe that it’s gotten worse before it will get better, but the light at the end of the tunnel is that it will get better. Collectively, we have to make the shift.

My Kiddos,
                             <br><br>

Sadly I have to write you this letter as a way to explain why your life has to be lived the way it does and why your mom lived the way she lived. When I was a sophomore in college in the year 2020 I took part in a class called The Climate Crisis, one that educated me and fellow students on the climate crisis that we were going through at our time. That was a long time ago and quite frankly, a lot can change in the 40 years that have passed by. My professor did his best to educate us on how this crisis began and what we personally could do to create a change in our world. While it was helpful for us and the majority of our generation it was too late to stop the inevitable end that our world would see. We were taught about the detrimental side effects of fossil fuel emissions and how cruel the agricultural industry could be when it came to maintaining said industry, it was shocking. We were taught that we must find ways to produce energy that was not harmful to our planet and find ways to sustain the growing population of people that made up our world, 97% of the world. We were taught ways to personally sustain the world and how to advocate for political change as a way to bring change amongst the world. As we were being taught this though we were also being educated on the vast amount of people who believe climate change is a hoax, a belief that was allowed to be taught and spread, particularly among our people, the American people, leading to detrimental effects.
                             <br><br>

As you both know the North Pole and the vast areas of ice that had been a part of our planet for centuries is now gone. You both know that some countries have become completely desolate as it is not sustainable to live amongst those lands anymore due to lack of water and extreme heat. As you both know, migration has occurred worldwide causing most people to live in overcrowded cities in the few countries that can still sustain life. While our population has gone down it was not due to the education of women and the conscious minds of couples to have fewer children, but is due to the immense heat that has taken over the planet and has killed millions of people. You both are extremely fortunate to live in this world that my grandparents, your great-grandparents, generation ultimately destroyed many many years ago. Did you both know that at the time I took the Climate Crisis course America was responsible for 1/4th of all greenhouse gas emissions? 1/4th. While you both are fortunate to live in this country, it was because people lived in this country that millions of people suffered and perished due to the climate crisis as the poorest of the world accounted for 1% of all greenhouse gas emissions, so pretty much none. 
                             <br><br>

As you are aware, you grew up in a household that grew their own food in our garden out back. While we did not live in a city like most people and like my professor recommended to me many years ago, we made sure that our location was a short commute to anything that we needed. While your dad could not help but drive a vehicle due to his profession as a police officer, his department switched all of their vehicles to electric, which while they use more CO2 in production, they produce almost none throughout their lifespan. I on the other hand, as you both know that I was a teacher, tried my best to limit my car use by riding my bike almost everywhere I needed to go: the school, the grocery store, friend's houses, etc. As a family we switched to an electric car so that, when I did need to use a vehicle, we could do so, remember going to visit your grandparents where your mom is from? As you both got older and wanted to go places on your own or visit your grandparents on your own we put you both on the train so that it was more efficient. You both probably never thought twice about the decisions we made, but we made them not only for you both, but for the planet as well.
                             <br><br>

Sadly, while me and your dad were conscious of our actions and did our best to create an environmentally friendly lifestyle for you both, the majority of the world, particularly America, did not do the same. While you dad and I create a household that used environmentally sustaining energy, implemented solar panels, switched to more efficient refrigeration methods, and, in a way, lived as minimalist as we could, most people continued to desire more and enable the still growing consumer culture. You dad and I voted for politicians that would advocate for the Green New Deal and policies that would benefit the earth, but like we saw every single time, they would focus more on their other policies than on the one that really mattered. We as a nation failed to rid ourselves of the corrupting law that allowed people to falsely educate people on the climate change hoax and by failing to do so it made it extremely difficult to create change in a timely manner. I mean, we have started to change our ways, but that change should have come when I was 19 years old sitting in that classroom at UCSB, not when you both were 19 years old. The change that came was too late and now is redundant to helping the cause. 
                             <br><br>

When I was 19 years old it was dire for change to come within the next 5 years but it could be stretched to the next 10 if more people were becoming conscious of their actions. When you both reached the age of 19 it was well past that 10 year stretch and, like my grandparents generation did, it was too late to fix what had already been done. I had a hard time having children when your dad and I decided to as I knew that our world was going to fall apart within a matter of time and I did not want my children to have to suffer from not only the impacts of my grandparents from from their own parents as well. At the time I had you both I had hope that our world could potentially change their mindset and create change amongst the people, but as you both grew the reality of the situation set in and I realized that no, our world was not changing and there was absolutely nothing that I could have done. While I tried my best to provide you both with the best life and with the most sustainable lifestyle, what I was doing was only one drop in a bucket of few others who were doing the same...isn't that just sad?
                             <br><br>

Now, my babies, I am so sorry that you have to live in the world that you do and that I brought you into a world that I should have know would not change. From now on you both will most likely not be able to have children of your own, and while that saddens me immensely, I hope that you make the conscious decision not to as they will not be able to live a long life. You both have to be conscious of any fossil fuel emission that you participate in as now more than ever even the slightest emission can warm the earth to a point of no return. You both have to suffer extreme temperatures and unnatural weather events, yes, unnatural because trust me, we never went through most of these events. Neither of you will ever understand what it was like eating cow meat, which do not get me wrong, was absolutely delicious, but was not at all sustainable for this earth and its industry caused a lot of grief and catastrophe throughout the world. You both will never experience flying to another country only getting there by ship, which takes a lot longer, limiting you ability to explore the world and see all the beauty it had. But that is the saddest thing. This world has lost most of its beauty due to the actions of us humans who have killed millions of species, destroyed the absolutely vast and stunning ocean, have exhausted the earth for everything it has due to our greed and selfishness. I am so sorry that I had to write you both this letter as, like I only slightly understand, the world you both will continue to live in will truly have only a few years left and I apologize for the actions of the generations before me and my own generations actions which have led you both to live your lives under restrictions.
                             <br><br>

With the utmost love and immense sorrow,
                             <br><br>

Dear future self, 


It is now the year of 2060,                              <br><br>

Reflecting back on my life, so much has happened since I was really informed about our climate crisis and how our individual actions greatly impact our environment. The year was 2020, stepping into a class called Climate Crisis 101 with Professor Ken Hiltner. Before taking this class, I knew about climate change, but not enough to fully understand the consequences of my actions as an individual in a developed country. From eating meat almost everyday, traveling via car everyday, and buying clothes every so often, every single one of these actions greatly contributed to my individual carbon footprint. How was I so clueless about my actions, not thinking about how such small actions can greatly impact our environment. After taking the climate crisis class, there’s so much I have learned that I still apply to my life today. I vote for politicians who put the environment before corporate interests. I made the conscious decision to make a change in my lifestyle and influence others to do the same. Looking through the lens of my future self, my meat consumption has been cut drastically, I consume no meat. I travel via public transportation because it has become our norm. Crazy how we were able to change our ways! I now shop at thrift shops or buy from companies that invests back into the environment. 
                             <br><br>


Looking back on the year of 2020, I think it was a lesson for me in general as a victim of capitalism. It was so crucial for me to self reflect on my actions as an individual knowing what I know now about our climate crisis. I am so grateful for Ken, teaching us about how we can individually navigate our way through this; how we each can make a difference as individuals in a developed country. 2020, in general was a year that captured the attention of everyone. From the outbreak of the coronavirus, affecting everyone globally, it was crucial as to how we attacked the issue that is our climate crisis. Taking preventative measures to stop the melting of the permanent frost so that thousands of year old viruses and disease won’t impact us the way corona has. Taking preventative measures to stop mankind from ending mankind and the entire world through their actions. 

                             <br><br>

Today, the carbon tax exists, people use public transportation, city living/co-housing is a norm, growing our own foods to prevent food waste, etc. All the alternatives Ken has stated that allowed us to imagine a world without fossil fuel are now our realities. Although it took time, it was so crucial for us to make the transition as fast as possible to preserve and save what was left of our world. Although it’s not much, we did what we could to save it. I’m writing this to let you know that you should be the change you want to see in the world and that it’s not too late to take action now.

As I am thinking about to what to write for my English professor's final comment assignment, a vortex open up and spits out a 60 year old me from the future. He is sweating, panicked, has minor bleeding; It's clear this is a pessimistic, not joyous encounter. Instead of making this a meet and greet, my future self says "come with me" as he grabs me and jumps through the portal. We are teleported to an unfamiliar place that looks like the movie 2012: gray skies, dark clouds, flames, powerful winds, shaking grounds like an earthquake, and more extreme weather patterns to come. He says this is Santa Barbara 40 years in the future, even though it feels like another planet. My future self explains to me how we got here and how it got this bad…
                             <br><br>

"By every country putting their own agenda's and short term gain over the climate crisis, no one was able to come together to face this apprehensive catastrophe. Instead of uniting as humans, nations came into more conflicts with each other. The terms of the climate summit were never enforced, and the Green New Deal was never signed because environmentalist never made it to politic power.  Diffusion of responsibility and skepticism prolonged activism, and companies paid off influential people to advance the interest of the fossil fuel industry. As the weather patterns worsened coastal cities flooded and dry areas burned, leaving hundreds of millions of people lost and trying to immigrate to already over-populated places. Diseases and crime rates rose immensely by over-crowded places. Terrorism increased from aggressive patriotism. Governments could not function with problems and tensions rising too quickly. Chaos and wars descended, both civilly and between countries, brutally solving the population problem quicker than mother nature. All societies lost their culture and identity, and the world became a dark place. As the years went on, the world regressed, becoming less advanced and less civil. All luxuries we take for granted now, like being well-fed and using transportation, are long gone. The main enemy in world war three are not humans slaughtering each other, which expedites fate, but global warming, which will inevitably end all life. "
                             <br><br>

My future self shows me all these things in a Christmas-Carroll like fashion to emphasize that this one future is not the only future. There is still time to act and reverse the affects of the climate crisis; there is not time for our future self's future generations to do it. To progress the human race and save the earth, mankind has the power to conquer such an ambitious, daunting task. My 60-year-old self is making sure I don’t snooze this call to action, like I did by zoning out Mr. Hiltner's lectures. (keep in mind this literary work is fictional, of course I paid great attention in all of my English 23 classes). This future is over-exaggerated within a 40 year span, but if we do not accept the call to action soon, whose to say a number of these things won't come true.

The year is 2060. My family and I had recently moved from Atlanta to Nashville due to the consistent rising sea level threatening the city as almost quarter of Georgia was experiencing constant flood, and half of Florida was under the water. Natural disasters are no strangers on news stations, as a severe and unexpected tornado had just hit Savannah, Georgia 3 in the morning and destroyed half of the town. Since most people were sleeping, everyone was caught off guard and a few had lost their lives in the storm. The hashtag #prayforSavannah is trending on all social medias and people are volunteering to help rebuild the town. This is the 3rd town being torn down in the US due to unexpected natural disasters, and we are not even half way through 2060 yet. People were becoming numb to these news reports and numbers, as few of my friends couldn’t care less. “We are all gonna die soon anyway, might just as well live it up” quoted from my friend. 

                             <br><br>

I have to admit I’m one of the few lucky ones. After graduating from UCSB, I tried to start my own business back in Atlanta. At the same time, I had decided to gradually transition to a climatarian lifestyle as I wanted to start the change from myself. I started practicing vegetarianism once a week, 2 days a week, until I had become a full time vegetarian. It was hard kissing goodbyes to Kbbq, what I believe was worth it for the generations coming behind us. Meanwhile, I have been living in the city ever since due to its convenience to my business and its lower impact on climate change. Everyday I take shuttles to commute despite how poor the transportation system is in downtown ATL. I knew bunches of people in the office were trying to allocate more funding in public transportation, but thanks to big car ride service companies acting behind the scene, that dream never came true, and now Uber rides are now dominating on the streets. 

                             <br><br>


Although my career with my business wasn’t a smooth sail, I had accumulated quite a few fortune at the end of the day. And I have to admit that I was lucky to be financially equipped enough to avoid the first wave of climate disasters. Around 2027 or 2028, massive Earthquakes hit the Chili coast, not only shattered the whole Bay area, but also caused a massive Tsunami that wiped the coast clean. Early warnings were issued, but not everyone was able to make it out. Meanwhile, Famine and Death was raging in African continent as the weather had been consecutively hitting record highs, killing both people and crops, as annual food production was quickly spiraling down. Numerous countries had to rely on the UN aids for survival, as tension built up in the region due to the lack of resources. Local skirmishes were broken out and casualties were high, yet UN could do nothing about it since each country had already been busy struggling with the Climate Crisis by themselves.

                             <br><br>

Looking back at it, I believe things could be a lot better if we had put our focus on the issue of climate change earlier. Despite the growing voices of the scientists and the activists, the US government just wouldn’t pick up the call as ocean and atmospheric pollution kept hitting record highs. It wasn’t until the mid 40’s that politicians and the people were starting to take Climate Change seriously and act upon it. Against major fossil fuel companies strong opposition, the Congress had finally passed the Green New Deal. The government decided to quickly transition into clean renewable energy production. The sudden action of cracking down on oil drilling and fracturing made these fossil fuel companies take a huge hit, as few of them quickly declared bankruptcy. However, all the actions were inevitably too late, as global temperature had risen substantially in the past decades and reversing the change took an absolutely enormous amount of effort. We could have been voicing our opinions better and acknowledging the harsh reality we were facing, but we were too late to make the change.

<p>
Dear future kiddos of mine,                             <br><br>

Hey future kids! I am writing to you from the year 2020; A time when I was 18-19 and a freshman in college at UCSB. I’ll try to leave some pictures in the capsule for you to see how everything looked like, including myself, before it got better. I’m not sure how many kids I decided to have but this goes out to all ya’ll or to you. 
                             <br><br>

It all started freshman year in college, I was ignorant, yes mommy was ignorant. I did not fully understand the magnitude of the crisis we were in. Two things: one-the word ignorant has such a negative connotation but it should not because it literally means lacking in knowledge and there is no shame in lacking knowledge as long as you keep learning. Plus, no one is done learning so don’t be afraid to admit to ignorance. And two, I will refer to climate change as a crisis because in current times with me it is by all means a crisis and I’m hoping that is not the case for you/all. Anyways, I thought I knew about climate change and that I was doing my part to combat it. But fuck was I so wrong. Essentially, I came into college all doe eyed not really aware as to what journey I was about to embark on. The start was learning how Eco friendly UCSB is. UCSB composts, there are plenty of recycling bins around campus, there are clubs dedicated to environmental preservation around Isla vista, and did I mention the bicycle culture here? It’s huge! We have bike parking everywhere. But the best part was yet to come. I decided to take a course for winter quarter called “The Climate Crisis” (English 23). The course description made it seem like it was going to be a really good class and kids it is: which by the way I recommend taking a class similar to this one about the importance of environmental preservation. The class consisted of lectures, films/videos,student discourse with an in-class mic to speak and comments made on videos. The rising ocean temperatures, melting ice caps and permafrost, dying corals, deforestation, increasing forest fires, chaotic weather, cheap labor, education system, fashion industry, meat industry, single use packaging are all just a few issues we learned about.
                             <br><br>

This class motivated and moved students to become political and exercise their political power. Politicians who believed in the green movement, it was a mixture of Democrats and Republicans took over all levels of government. The Green New Deal was revised before it could be considered to pass as legislation and be enforced. Slowly and steadily the changes have started to show; to be honest not many changes could take place because of a certain virus going around. I will continue to add pages into this capsule to continue to update on the changes going on. I’ll keep you/all updated.
                             <br><br>

Lastly, I want to finish this. I love you. No matter what happens whether you live in a 100% renewable energy, waste free society or one that has completely gone to shit knows that I will be proud of you for being empathetic,compassionate, caring children. Remember to keep taking care of the earth. The Earth is a strong force, we are minuscule compared to such power and beauty. Like Gould, Stephen Jay said, “She holds all the cards and has immense power over us—so such a compact, which we desperately need but she does not at her own time scale, would be a blessing for us, and an indulgence for her. We had better sign the papers while she is still willing to make a deal. If we treat her nicely, she will keep us going for a while. If we scratch her, she will bleed, kick us out, bandage up, and go about her business at her planetary scale.”

To my future self,                              <br><br>

It is 2020 the school year just ended because of an out break of the corona virus and drastic measures are being taken, however this isn’t the most catastrophic event happening at the time. Climate change is rapidly occurring and as of now we are reaching the 2 degree Celsius that the Paris Agreement warned us about. If it exceeds this amount we will have disastrous events occur such as fires, droughts, rise in sea level, famine, conflict, and extinction of humankind as we know it. I’m telling you this now to change your habits!! This is not a warning it’s an order from old me to to you. If you want a life full of well life then start changing and implementing a  climate change aware lifestyle. Tell your friends, family, someone you just met an hour ago, anyone matters. The more people are aware the more they will attempt to change their lives and one by one we will have an army of climate change activist that will single out the climate change deniers and those who just decide to ignore the climate crisis. Think about your kids, our kids! Do you want them to live a life full of famine and uncontrollable weather that causes uttermost destruction? Educate them and they will educate their friends and the generations to come. The previous generation from mine didn’t do a good job and now we’re in this mess together and they don’t have to worry about it. We however have this on our hands and it’s our job to do what they couldn’t. I hope my kids get to see this and realize that all the effort the people from our generation put we’re not for nothing but that my kids can actually enjoy all outdoor activities we did as kids. I hope my message will be seen one day and you’ll remember this for a lifetime, till next time future self.

As I finished my last surgery, I went to the patient’s family and told them that everything went okay. I feel a great satisfaction when I see their big and bright smiles across their faces. The patient’s daughter hugs me and thanks me for my work, and I head to my office. The surgery lasted eight hours as there were complications along the way. I sit down on my chair and look across the window just to realize that it is raining. Before, I would be puzzled as it would never rain during these months, but the climate has changed so drastically in the past two decades. While I was looking at the rain, I received a notification on my phone from my best friend at UCSB telling me that a former English 23 professor has passed away. My best friend, now a renowned professor at UCSB, and I both had professor Hiltner for different classes. This message struck me, and it made me think about the time I took English 23 40 years ago. I put my phone down, turned back at the window and I got lost in my thoughts while I watched the acid rain pour.
                              <br><br>

I was a sophomore back in 2020. A sophomore that knew little to nothing about climate change. I was a sophomore that was trying to survive through the toughest quarter of my college career—spoiler alert: there were harder times. As I was picking my classes for Winter quarter, my best friend suggested to take English 23 with Professor Kenneth Hiltner as she said,
                             <br><br>
“he is a really good professor and the class is a really good opportunity to learn more about the climate crisis.” Encouraged by her, I decided to take this class. I figure it would not hurt to take a GE in the midst of all the stem classes I had already scheduled. At first I thought this class was going to have the same structure as a normal English class, yet I quickly realized that It was not. From the very first lecture, Ken had my attention, and by the end of the quarter, he had changed me. The class had a focus to inform students about the imminent threat of climate crisis in our lives and what each one of us can do to mitigate such problems. Ken did not try to convert us to radical environmentalists or anything like that. He just tried to make us aware of what was happening in our world. He blamed his generation for failing so horribly to reduce climate change as they did not do anything to stop it. It was now our time, my generation’s time, to take the lead for a better and greener future. From this class I learned some ways in which I could help the planet. Of course, I was a young student at the time, and I failed from time to time to stick to my environmental goals, but I never gave up. Some of the ways I helped reduced my personal carbon footprint was to become a climatarian (a person who limits food waste, and avoids eating meat products as much as they can with the goal of reducing CO2 emission), to vote as much as I could about greener policies and spread them to those near me, and also by giving up flying as much as I could. This last one has been the hardest one because, as a surgeon, sometimes I need to be in helicopters with patients or be transported to far places to help people in critical condition. Other ways I have contributed to a reduction in emissions, are by biking and walking to work and educating my two wonderful children about the importance of taking care of our planet. Following the two years after this course, I participated in some campaigns to promote politicians who wanted to help the planet, and some protests as well.
                             <br><br>
 
After my graduation, I went to medical school where I had one of the hardest, most stressful yet fascinating times of my life. While I kept implementing the things I learned from English 23, I failed sometimes due to all the worked and sleepless nights. However, I did not give up. When I turned 26 years old, I graduated from medical school, and I was now planning to do my internship and then my residency to become a surgeon. Something I forgot to mention was that democrats had lost the presidency in 2020 due to their disunion. This election was a turning point for the next decade as we needed to change the structure of our government and allow for a greener and more sustainable nation. However, republicans did little to nothing to stop fossil fuel industries from polluting our planet, and instead of implementing regulations, they allowed them to become more powerful. By 2024, our CO2 emissions had gone from 415 parts per million to 515 in four years. This of course had terrible consequences across the world as many people perished due to hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis. I was devastated that this had happened to our planet as I was hoping for the future I had imagined back in 2020, but this did not stop me or other environmentalists from doing our work. Ken became more influential as he started to become more recognized by other countries while still teaching at UCSB. Going back to when I had just graduated from medical school, the situation seemed to be getting worse. There was still a republican president sitting in office. Anyways during my residency, I met the love of my life. We met in the hospital when I was heading out for home exhausted, but I heard someone crying. As I followed the sound of her sobs, I found her crying, alone. At first, I thought of leaving her alone, but then decided not to.
                             <br><br>
I approached and asked, “Are you okay? Is there anything I can do for you”?
                             <br><br>
and she replied, “I am not okay. I just saw a little boy die. He was not under my supervision, but I was helping the lead surgeon, and we just lost him.”
                             <br><br>
To that I did not know what to say. I knew that losing a patient is really traumatic. So, I did not say anything. I sat down beside her, put my arm around her shoulders and stayed there while she cried her heart out.
                             <br><br>
Following that incident, we started going out and we realized that we had both gone to UCSB and taken English 23. We both shared our frustrations with what had been happening after that year in college. We eventually got engaged and got married. At first we decided to not have children as we had worked a lot and opted to adopt children in the future. However, we changed our mind and had two children. This was in 2032.
                             <br><br>
 
Moving forward 20 years from that date, now is 2052. It has been 32 years since I took English 23. At this point in my life, democrats had taken over the presidency following the 2032 elections and had not lost ever since. In fact, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez became the first woman president in 2032. That year, there was a major change in our government to become greener. Sadly, it was too late to reverse climate change. We had gone too far. Earthquakes became as usual as rain; floods were a monthly thing and the air quality had become so poor. However, we did not give up. Democrats and environmentalists worked really hard to reduce greenhouse emissions. It was hard at first, but it seemed that we all wanted the same thing: a better future. I know, we should have done this way earlier, but we ignored all the signs and warnings. 22 years after AOC’s election, the world was becoming a better place. We still had to work really hard to change our planet’s direction. Ken became the new UN messenger of peace and was awarded the Nobel prize for the environment. He became a really strong advocate for climate change and certainly changed our lives.
                             <br><br>
 
My children were educated to help the planet and take care of it. My wife and I taught them to be the change they wanted to see in the world. I was…. “knock, knock.” I come back to reality--back to 2060--and realize that someone was knocking at my door. It was my wife. She came in to tell me that we received an invitation to Ken’s funeral. She approached, kissed me and left. I realized I had been thinking about this for about an hour and that the rain had stopped. As of now, democrats have nominated the house and presidency for quite some years as people realized that republicans were not doing anything to change the climate crisis. While I felt completely discouraged to continue with my environmental goals after republicans won the presidency for 3 more successive terms 2020-2032, I never give in. I still had hope that humanity would realize that this problem was imminent.. Yes, every year the government did not do anything to stop fossil fuels felt like a loss for me, for other people, and for the planet. Thanks to our perseverance and continuous support for the environment, earthquakes and floods had become less frequent. They still happen from time to time but not as often. Seasonal fluctuations are still out of order and might not come back to normal. Basically, every season on the earth moved 3 months from their place of origin. For instance, spring is now in June and so forth. We still have acidic rains due to all the pollution we had generated but we are seeing a reduction. It will take many more years before we get the planet back to normal, but at least it will not be destroyed by our actions. I am 60 years old, and I am so proud of having taken that class. It helped me become an advocate for the environment, helped educate my children to do the same, and ultimately allowed me to become a surgeon.
                             <br><br>
It’s time to go. My wife is waiting for me…

wow... this was a very creative and thought-provoking comment, good job.  It's pretty scary to imagine a world where earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and floods become a regular occurrence, but at the rate we are moving at now I think it could become a reality sooner than we think.  I really liked how you brought an optimistic outlook on a very depressing issue and topic and brought to light that there is a chance for us to make a difference now as well.

A letter to the future, 2060
                              <br><br>

Hello there, it is from me in the past, 2020. 
                              <br><br>

I wish in the 2060, the time far from now, the earth has already been saving by us, the human. We are the one who puts ourselves in the serious situation and the only one can change it. Just like what I say, I really hope that in the future, the technology can crucially reduce the amount of greenhouse gas in every industry, if possible, even reducing the level of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. 
                              <br><br>

For the daily diet, I hope that big portion of human in the planet will switch to the plant-based diet to eliminate the possible greenhouse gas generated by the livestock industry. Since some companies has already began to develop the cultured meat for the daily diet, it will be pretty stable in the future becoming the necessary part in the dining table. And the food trend at that time should be much simpler than now and healthier. 
                              <br><br>

The daily transportation will be majorly public transportation and bicycle. Less people take the air trip to other countries, the countries will have maglev train as the one kind of transportations that largely decrease the amount of carbon emission for sure. I believe the environmental problems can stimulate people to improve and innovate the technology nowadays. 
                              <br><br>

The waste in clothes will be abundantly eliminate by stopping lots of commercials. The fast trend will be largely decreased to save the cost for producing a cloth. The workers get the improvement in every part of the job, like limiting the work hours and getting safety working condition. People in 2060 will think about the relation between fashion industry and environment and take the action early than us in 2020 hopefully. 
                              <br><br>

But most important thing is people in 2060 will take action involving the climate change. Everyone learns from the tragedy in 2020, and gets into the action that can make the climate change slowing down. It includes the small things that person can do it in several minutes like stopping to waste the water and food, and the bigger stuffs, so as voting and becoming climate activism. I wish that people can change the situation in 2060 faster and more effective than now. 
                              <br><br>

By the last, I really have one big dream just for now: I wish I could see this letter four decades after, 2060. 
 
                              <br><br>

Best wishes For Me

<p>
To my future:
                               <br><br>

2020 only goes through less than a quarter. However, 2020 is a tough year until now. The virus spread the whole world and will keep spreading for a while. People are not aware that COVID-19 is a big deal until it explodes and becomes unstoppable. Is it similar to the environmental crisis? People enjoy their life until they figure out the crisis is a real deal. Then, they are also aware that they can not stop the crisis anymore. It is a paradox. People will never put the environment issue at the first place until the material desire of most people is satisfied which will never happen. The material desire of people always increases with the increase of ability. Thus, the day people put the environment issue at the first place is the day the environment crisis heavily influences the life of people. 

                              <br><br>

There are a lot of people who believe technology can save people in the environmental crisis. The Plague is an old, dangerous disaster for humans as a group. People believe advanced biotechnology can overcome it easily. However, the COVID-19 teaches everybody a lesson. The COVID-19 will eventually pass away. Luck is the most important factor for people to survive until today. However, even though we went through a hundred crises before, the chance of extinction next still is fifty percent. Humans are still really weak, but humans are really confident. We believe we can control our life, and we dominate the earth for reasons. However, it is all probability. Humans as a species are extremely lucky. Humans are possible to extinct in the future environment crisis or artificial intelligence crisis without any specific reason. 
                              <br><br>


So, what should I or you, the future of me do. Well, since you are the future of me, I assume you learn more than me. Thus, you can make a better decision than me. I just record what I will do in case you may forgot. I believe the best way to face the uncertainty of tomorrow is to enjoy today. Sounds cliche right? It is a little bit different. What I mean to enjoy today is not to party whole night and smoke until night. What I mean to enjoy life is to live hard, to burn yourself everyday. to enjoy the process and to expect the result. Everynight before sleep, you should have no regrets for today and feel ok never wake up tomorrow. If you do not die tomorrow, you should appreciate the good luck and input hundred passion in tomorrow again. Let us be more specific. You should eat when you eat which means no phone, no talk, no social and no thought. You should just enjoy the process of the eating. Every time when you repeat the process of eating, you should focus on how to improve your eating speed, if you do not eat for taste but for nutrition, or improve the quality of the eating process, if you do enjoy the food,  and so on. However, every second you should live hard, there is no moment that should be called boring. I do not how other people identify success, but I believe if you can achieve this situation one day, you are really successful.

March of 2060:                               <br><br>

We did not act fast enough or strictly enough in the past, and now it is biting us in the ass. Everything has taken a turn for the worst and the climate has gotten to a point where change is the only option, regardless of what corrupt politicians and business moguls may state. Hunger, dehydration, wildfires, hurricanes, storms, earthquakes, eruptions, pollution, and tornados are rampant. Action is not something that can be argued about anymore. Action is the only viable plan to partake in if we want to keep this Earth viable. We have hurt the planet to an extent that we KNEW was possible, and it is shameful to say that just 40 years ago, we were all completely aware of the implications of climate change. But yet, we still did nothing.

                               <br><br>

In 2020, i was a freshman at UC Santa Barbara. UCSB was one of the most enviromentally conscious and environmentally activist school in the US. Students tended to lean towards policy and legislation that increased the fight against the climate crisis and many students took action to fight for 100% renewable energy, less food waste, and cleaner practices on campus. I took a class in a huge lecture hall where we learned about the climate crisis through reading numerous scholarly articles, watching informative films, and of course extremely insightful lectures by our professor, Ken Hiltner. Ken really inspired me. Before the class I already was a huge advocate for preventing further climate change and was an advocate for clean living, but after taking the class, my eyes were opened. We tend to believe that this is a fight that cannot be won without the support of the people who lead our country, but in reality, people banding together is the most powerful root of change. I learned the importance of voting and using our voices to create changes like the Green New Deal. As I grew up and became an adult, one thing always frustrated me the MOST. How can politicians DENY the climate crisis when there are hard facts and real life examples showing how we are severely damagin our Earth? How can boomers DENY the climate crisis when they themselves have contributed the most to it?? These questions made me SO ANGRY, and hearing that people denied our reality was extremely frustrating.

                               <br><br>

2020 was the year that we needed change. There was an election for President of the United States in 2020, where many people hoped that a Democratic candidate would be elected and further implement changes. Change is in the hands of the people. The people have held the most power in the past when it comes to change, and it will always be the power of the people that creates the most change. So I ask of the new generation, what are you all waiting for?

It’s interesting when you mentioned that “change is the only option” because there is no more room for flexibility and we as a human race have finally pushed over a tipping point. It’s incredibly sad to face the truth when corrupt politicians have to come up with solutions to fight climate change because it’s the only way left to get the votes. These people should be the ones guiding us through this whole climate crisis ordeal, but instead they chose to partner with business moguls to earn some extra cash. It’s sickening to the core that there are people out there that could easily betray what had given us life that could ultimately influence our health in a profound manner. I hope the economy shifts in a way that favors the sustainability effort that had been implemented in recent years. Companies that support this practice should be rewarded perhaps through carbon tax deduction assuming that had been initiated. I do believe there are a small group of people that never stop fighting. However, their voice was too small to be heard. Personally, I think online petition is just as effective as any sort of physical protest since the internet has expanded to an intangible limit in this century. 
                               <br><br>

I applaud UCSB’s effort in innovating its campus into an environmentally friendly space. With that being said, so much more could be done to make the school standout even more. As a freshman and sophomore who relied on the dining commons for meals, I witnessed way too much leftover food being wasted. Even though my friend started the program that allows people to donate unused meal swipes (IT’S REAL!!!), but people who donated actually never even set food in the dining commons. In theory, it’s a great plan but it’s not beneficial to helping reduce food waste. What I propose is that the chefs and cook preps should only whip up delicious entrees when people are in demand. I do like the small portion size because it serves as a safeguard for those who never finish their food. The issue here is what if the person didn’t like the dish at all… Therefore, I think there should be some sort of tasting before someone picks up the plate to ensure they would enjoy the food and also prevent it from going into the trash.

A message from the future,                               <br><br>

This is a message for the future. Currently the year is 2060. I look around me and I don’t see the same world as 20 years ago. I remember the days when I was a teenager and you can look up to see the stars. I’d search for constellations or planets. Now the only light in the sky are planes. 
                               <br><br>
My favorite place was the ocean. My friends and I would meet up at the beach and watch the sunset while ending the day with s’mores over the Bonfire. This was back when the ocean was crystal blue and the fires we set didn’t spread across entire continents. 
                               <br><br>
No doubt, times have been bad before, but this is by far the worst I’ve ever seen. They said I was overreacting, that it wouldn’t ever affect us, that the facts were false. Now, as I step outside and look around me, I can barely see any color. I wonder to myself: where did all the green go? There’s no rain to water the grass and there’s no trees that are planted. I can’t even breathe in the air without a face mask. More than two thirds of the world doesn’t have clean water and wars have increased greatly. The United States now owns the lands with the cleanest water, and are withholding them from the other nations. It seems that people will never learn any lessons. 
                               <br><br>
All I have to say is I’m sorry. I did what I could. I went vegetarian, I switched to biking and public transport, I had led a minimalist lifestyle. However, one’s individual action was not enough. The sad reality of our world today is that we were warned, but we didn’t listen. I had even taken a course that warned us about the dangers of our ways, but it seems as if it’s too late.  I hope for whoever is reading this that your generation changes something or creates a movement that we never did.  Please tell me if things changed. 
                               <br><br>
I’m sorry.
                               <br><br>

A message for the past,                               <br><br>

The year is 2100. Although you're long gone I still feel the need to write this to you. I have good news. I look around me and I don’t see the same world as 20 years ago, I see a better one. I see one with stars and a clean ocean. I love the ocean too. Colors shine bright as ever and I see a lot of green. This is by far the most beautiful land I’ve seen. The air is even breathable! The reality of our world has changed.
                               <br><br>
 Don’t be sorry. This fight was a long one to win, but the movement finally won. Things have changed. The New Green deal has been passed and implemented. Everyone’s carbon footprint is half of what it was before. Very few people still eat meat and all energy is either renewable or nuclear. The battle that you fought for has finally been won. 
                               <br><br>
However, they weren’t wrong when they said we’re too late though, many lives were lost and the amount of species that have gone extinct has been detrimental. Entire governments have collapsed in third world countries. It will hopefully always be remembered, as they teach it in world history and plan to teach it forever. All I can hope now is that people will learn their ways, and this crisis can always be avoided. 
                               <br><br>
Thank you.

This is a message from the future. It must be hard for you to believe that you can receive a message from yourself forty years later. 2020 is an amazing and unique year for you, because after taking English 22, you are amazed by Professor Ken’s knowledgement and decided to take English 23 to learn more about the climate change and environmental crisis. These are all really popular topics at that time, because people are starting to realize that the environment is tightly bonded with every living thing on the earth. And no matter how rich or powerful human becomes, people will still die or suffer due to the change of the environment. It is very urgent to spread the message to more people and let them realize that everyone has to take actions right now in this moment to make a difference for the future generations. 
                                <br><br>

After attending the lectures, watching the films and reading articles about the climate crisis people are facing right now, you must be very worried about the future. But be hopeful and strong, because you and your classmates, the young generation who truly understand the importance of protecting the environment will do their best to make a change. People will change their habits to save the planet, such as driving less cars, eating less meat, buying less unnecessary clothes. Because most of you know the price and consequence people have to pay for those actions. 
                                <br><br>

You also learn the skills of communicating with people who do not believe in climate change, then use it in the daily to convince more people and let them realize the things they should not do to protect the Earth. Be patient and explain all the information, stories, interviews and statistics you have learned this quarter to the other people. You know the things you have to do, stop just thinking about them and start doing them right now. Do not wait until the environment becomes uninhabitable for humans, and then regret that people did not save the planet when they still can.

To those who will be 22 (my age now) in 2060,
                                <br><br>


Right now it is 2020. It is a confusing time. I am about to graduate college and am supposed to be excited about the future and my spot within said time. While I used to think that so many exciting things were on the rise, I am writing this letter on a particularly sad time in history. We are in the middle of a climate disaster that has failed to change the course of current policy maker’s mind. We are in the midst of a pandemic that has the capacity to spread to many people in the world; some will not make it. We are in the midst of universities being shut down, professional sports leagues halted, and events postponed. There are places where people are not supposed to touch each other or even be in close proximity to one another. Businesses are shut down. Many small businesses will be hit the hardest. Grocery store shelves are running barren on cleaning supplies and groceries are being hoarded. It is, like I said, an extremely confusing time to be a young person. A young person who has been shaped her entire life to believe that the next chapter was full of promise. Optimistically, I still think it will be, but it is times like these where I find myself thinking “Did people always have to navigate such catastrophic historical times?” I think the answer is yes. People have had to endure historical hardships, fend for loved ones, and sit with immense uncertainty for what the future would hold. Know that whatever history is being written right now will soon be that-- just history. You will get through whatever is thrown at you. It may be tough, but as a community you must stick together. You must fight for what you want. You must never let authority take your spirit, for it is when you shout together that your voices are heard. 

                                <br><br>

Some countries are doing a better job at combating these crises than others, specifically the climate crisis. Many developed countries are using hydraulic and even nuclear energy to substitute dirty energy from fossil fuels. Agricultural shifts are taking place. Sustainable companies are coming to the surface. Soon, some countries will have phased out cars that run on gas. New green-centric infrastructure is being built in cities. It is an exciting time for climate technology, as so many countries have turned their focus to help save this planet from complete demolition. Unfortunately, the US is not taking these threats seriously, and our policies, products, and patterns are reflecting this avoidance. Hopefully by 2060, you will not be saying the same.

                                <br><br>

I, myself, am currently enrolled in a Climate Crisis class where we are exploring how climate change is being catalyzed by social, political, and economic behaviors. I have learned so much and am hopeful that courses like this one are the key to helping equip people of all ages and backgrounds with the tools needed to combat the climate crisis. Right now I am excelling in limiting my purchase of clothes made in the fast fashion sphere and am solely buying apparel from thrift and vintage stores. God, please tell me Forever 21 is permanently dismantled by now. I am also shifting my focus to driving way, way less, participating in slow travel, and practicing a vegetarian diet. I am fully aware that these things alone will not reverse the climate crisis, but I would like to note that awareness is KEY to combating any social issue, and by starting small, you as an individual have the potential to enact major change. Do not give up, even when times feel particularly grim. As a huge inspiration in my life, AOC once said, “We can be whatever we have the courage to see.”

In the early 2000’s, most people had at least heard about the idea of climate change. Although it seems completely insane to think about, a very large part of the population was entirely convinced that the climate crisis was not real, and that all the disasters that we were seeing because of it were naturally occurring and humans hadn’t done anything to impact our environment. Everyone had chosen a side, either you believed that the world would not go on without fossil fuels and that scientists had created the hoax of climate change for profit, or you knew that the oil industry was lobbying politicians to have less restrictions on their pollution at the expense of the environment and human life just to keep their hoard of wealth. A Green New Deal was introduced to save our planet and protect working families, and everyone had very strong, polarized opinions about it. It seemed like we would never see the end of this issue.
                                <br><br>
But in 2020 after decades of stressful debating, the world was struck with a pandemic, Covid-19, or coronavirus. The virus was known to be fatal for those with compromised immune systems, which was generally people on the older side. As it spread rapidly across the entire globe, people over 50 were dying faster and faster. After a couple years, the virus was virtually gone, and our population was cut almost in half. The world was completely changed, and the generations older than millennials were virtually nonexistent, everyone had lost family and friends to the virus. However, we were finally able to work on climate action without obstacles. Once the pandemic was gone, the Green New Deal was met with almost universal support. Carbon prices skyrocketed and the oil industry plummeted after a few years. My friends all graduated with jobs in clean energy, sustainable agriculture, and eco-friendly fashion. Thinking back on it now in the year 2060, I don’t think I knew anyone who ate any kind of red meat, it’s hardly even seen in stores and restaurants now. Since then, I have sustained a vegan diet and I live in an apartment building in a city that allows me to get by easily without a car. Because of the changes we were able to make back then, our economy flourishes now, the air is clear, natural disasters are more predictable, warming has slowed to almost nothing, and the best part is that nobody misses the way we used to live.

Its been 40 years since I truly discovered what the climate crisis was and the impacts it would soon have on all of our lives. I could never have imagined that we as a society would come this far, but I'm glad that we finally decided to take action. This action may have been much later than many of us would've wished who were activists from the start, but hey we are starting to see what we have wanted for so long. This fight is far from over, but let us all take a moment and reflect about how we have actually improved our situation. I am proud of the work that I have accomplished and that I was able to see through the deception and start fighting for our planet and its people before many people knew the extent of the climate crisis. 
                                <br><br>

I started my journey in 2020 and I would not make huge adjustments in my lifestyle for several years later. I was thinking back on a the course that I took in college that dealt with the climate crisis, the media was now starting to recognize the threat and I could no longer sit idly by with the knowledge that I had gained throughout the course. I started to remember that every week I had placed comments on YouTube videos my professor created and these videos served as the spark that reignited my sense of activism. I would have never thought at the time that these comments I was writing in college would shape the way I would carry out the rest of my life.
                                <br><br>

When my newfound sense of activism became a reality I started to change the way that I lived most of my life. I started with some of the easier things. first, I moved my diet to a completely vegan lifestyle. This was due to the fact that the meat industry is responsible for so much of the pollution that has caused the problems that we are now combatting. After I decided to clean up my diet and start doing what I should have done years in advance, I decided to reduce my carbon foot print even further and I started only traveling by bike or public transportation. The hardest part of this transition was the pact that I made with myself to stop using air travel. Many people did not believe me at the time that this was such a huge part of the pollution that we need to get rid of and it was saddening, it made me realize that so many people were so uneducated on the subject. I would soon move my lifestyle into directions that would completely change how I ever believed I would live out my post-college life. The next phase of my life was when I decided to start becoming a real activist and started to spread the knowledge I had gained in college. 
                                <br><br>

I am proud to say that the activism I participated in was not in vain. Since my years of becoming an activist we have seen a drop in the purchasing of meat products crippling the meat industry and moving people to more sustainable food sources. This was a huge victory. I was more happy when the major oil companies announced that they would pledge to stop fracking and ruining our environment. They are finally having to pay for their deceit and lies that they fed the whole world, selfish ideals and materialism started to decline after this monumental event happened. These past few years have been some of the greatest of my entire life and I am happy that I was able to participate as a scholar activist.
                                <br><br>

There are still many things that we need to improve upon to lessen the dangers that we face as a result of the climate crisis, but I am so proud of the steps that we have taken to mitigate the immediate risk. We were late, but we did come together to agree to make a change. These next generations will be the key to the future of our race on this planet and I hope that they to continue to push the world into a more sustainable and desirable place to live. Let us keep this activism strong and reflect on the past as a lesson.

  This is your future self from the year 2060 and I come with good news.  The Climate Crisis is over and the human race lives to fight another day.  I know right now your thinking that it all seems hopeless as in 2020 the CO2 levels were only rising and natural disasters were getting more catastrophic by the day.  In 2027 it wasn’t getting any better, you had gotten off beef, then went back on, then off, then on again, and your car got good mileage but let’s just say public transport was not your style.  Then on June 9th of that year the world would be changed forever when on both coasts the most deadly natural disasters in the history of the United States hit the East and West Coast at the same time.  California was hit by an earthquake near the San Andreas fault and Yosemite caught ablaze the day after.  New York was hit by a category 6 hurricane, yes you read that right 6.  These three were one right after the other causing billions of dollars of damage and thousands of casualties.  It didn’t help that our President Eric Trump cut the Federal Emergency Management Association in half in order to increase military spending (I’m assuming you're not surprised).  This was our wake up call.
                                <br><br>

 These natural disasters were getting progressively worse and Climate Change was the clear cause of it.  The people finally had enough of nothing being done about this Crisis and started to make a change.  It started with the election of 2028 where the people voted for a president that supported the Green New Deal, Bernie Sanders, who was still going strong at the age of 86.  I was a part of the campaign which I still am proud of to this day.  The United States citizens start to switch the culture of what was and wasn't cool.  Someone driving around in their own car was seen as selfish and public transport was the first choice of many Americans.  I finally got over the dislike of public transport and thoroughly enjoy the train ride to my job in the morning as one the government made the Am Track wayyyy nicer and two I know I am helping the environment with my choices.  The oil companies were in a frenzy to change this dislike towards cars and tried their best to sway Congress as they did many times in the past with their wallets.  This time it was different as the elected officials that were most popular were those that promised they would not accept donations from big business so their efforts were fruitless.   With all the new infrastructure being built to accommodate the Green New Deal their plenty of jobs to go around. 
                                <br><br>


The world watched the United States people turn their economy from one based on Carbon emissions and greed into a eco friendly carbon free society.  And as they watched they started to follow in our footsteps.  The world never reached the 2C breaking point that we all desperately feared. Thank God!!  As for my journey that beef I struggled with I got off for good this time along with all other carbon heavy foods and commodities.  I am 59 years old with a family that I know will live on and have children that will get to enjoy our beautiful world and that makes me happier than anything else.  Our generation will come to known as the ones that stood up and fought for our planet.

A message from the future,

                                <br><br>

This is the year 2060 and I am writing about your future. It is raining outside, too. However, the world has changed a lot and the climate crisis has been improved. So, don’t worry too much about the future and do everything you can for the world.
                                <br><br>


In 2060, 70% of human beings become vegetarians. I am quite sure that you are surprised since being a vegetarian is difficult for you as a carnivore. I guess you may worry about the test of food. However, scientists have already created special flavoring agents to improve the taste of plants. I know the truth would be hard to accept until you first eat steak-flavored potatoes in 2040. 
                                <br><br>


Also, people in 2060 seldom buy clothes because the fashion industry contaminated air and water. I think you may feel a little disappointed about that since you bought clothes almost every week as a freshman at UCSB. However, laws about buying clothes were established in 2035 that people are now allowed to buy over 25 pieces of clothing. The law has greatly improved the effectiveness of every item we bought. Instead, people are allowed to redesign their clothes through special procedures in order to follow the trend. 
                                <br><br>


As an old generation in 2060, I still remember the climate change classes at UCSB at your age. I also remember that English 22 talked about the history of climate consciousness and English 23 included a variety of solutions toward the climate crisis in the early twentieth century. The meanings of the two courses went beyond getting satisfying grades. I learned a lot from the courses and expected more people around me to realize the negative consequences of climate change. I once thought that climate change is hard to accept by the public because of politics and literacy. However, our generations have pursued others to make a difference and finally controlled the situation. 
                                <br><br>


Thus, things will be better and you are going to make a difference.

The clock strikes midnight and the ball drops, signalling the turn of the decade to 2060. It's been 40 years since I took that little, insignificant English course in college, back when I was a naive, bright-eyed young man, ready to strap into his boots and change the world in whatever small ways he knew how. Little did I know, that course was the single most important, yet single most ignored well of information in my time. Things are different now. Countless cities have been lost to the rising tides, raging fires, weather conditions, agricultural shocks, and countless other disasters. The human populations that remain have congregated into a precious few cities that siphon the last of the lifeblood of the planet in an attempt to endure the storm so that we may start anew, begin again. Ken, I'm sorry. We couldn't achieve what you had so earnestly asked us to do. While your words and your information and your guidance worked miracles to ignite the fires of change, imagination, excitement, and urgency in our strong young minds, there was little us incited few could do. We stood together in the face of widespread ignorance and denial, forged towards truth and unity with non-divisive words and strategies, as you had taught us. We pulled back on the needless luxuries of our lives, we found new happiness and contentment in the treasures of the soul and of minimalism. We did what we little humans could do, with all the fire in our breast and lightning coursing through our brains. But in all honesty, we felt the impending doom. Too little, too late. Pandemics and political turmoil drowned out the conversation surrounding climate change; our planet's well-being became an issue to warm the back-burner of political discourse; our efforts removed but a few footprints from an avalanche of wrongdoings and missteps. We tried, Ken. We appreciate everything that you did for us more than you can ever know. Your incredible humility in trying to bear the weight of all the mistakes of your generation, your boundless patience in confronting the idiosyncracies of naysayers and deniers, your incredible foresight in empowering the minds and bodies of the young. All were incredibly noble, heroic, far-seeing. We still remember you as our Prometheus, blessed with incredible fore-sight, engaged in the cause of humanity. We still appreciate what you tried to do, what you tried to change. You fought for and with us against the dying of the light, and that's a beautiful thing. Thank you, Ken. We tried our best, as did you.

The future is incredibly hard to predict. In regards to the climate crisis, many people have talked about whether or not there will be a future if humans continue to live the way they do currently. "A Message from the Future" was an amazing film that gave me a new perspective from a future point of view. I don't want to look back years from now regretting my actions in the present. I would like to look back thinking that I did the most I could and with passion, because I genuinely care about the world we live in. The film made me think about what more I could do to contribute, small or not. The beginning of the film references the Green New Deal and the fact that we have the technology to make sweeping change but people are not ready for it yet, it's a scary concept. That makes me incredibly angry because it's true and everyone is so divided, because while others like me strongly advocate and want change, there are others who oppose it with just as much ferocity. The end result is just a stalemate and if it continues this way with no change, the climate crisis will only worsen. 

                                <br><br>

Ken's intention to upload these comments elsewhere so that if YouTube is not around in 40 years made me feel warm. YouTube is such a huge part of the world now as it is largely accessible to internet users and have millions, maybe even more, videos about anything and everything. It is strange to think that one day YouTube may not be the platform people go to when they need a tutorial on a recipe, or a makeup look, or simply entertainment. But it is a very possible thought as social media platforms that came before, like MySpace for example, are now dated to my generation and new apps have become popular. This makes me think about what will be trendy when I am 60 years old. Even thinking about being 60 years old scares me. I've always been afraid of growing old, even the thought of turning 19 at the end of this month scares me. So I hope that when I am 60 and I search on the internet for this comment, I'll find it and remember sitting in my dorm chair writing this comment and chuckle at myself for writing this portion in. I really hope that happens. Although my plans for the future are still unclear, if I do I have children and maybe even grandchildren by the time I'm 60, I hope I can show them this comment and go on a tangent about my days as a college student and how different it is for them. I hope that I can do that in a world that is still how I remember it, at least in some ways, because I know that changes in technology will inevitably change the way the world looks. But I hope that I will still be able to look out the window and see trees and flowers, maybe even have a garden of my own. The climate crisis threatens this though with the consequences of sea level rise, wild fires, and more. I have no idea what the future will look like but I hope I will still be able to see remnants of the way of it looks now. 

                                <br><br>

The climate crisis calls for change. But I'm so incredibly scared that the change needed won't come soon enough before it's too late. Even in the current state it is in now, which is bad enough, not enough action is being taken. It breaks my heart that humans cannot come to a consensus about the Earth. Will inhabitation of another planet happen in my lifetime? I'm not really sure at all. But I hope that we can bring about change and that it won't have to be an option because I love planet Earth. I know that I am not doing enough but I try. I'm trying to do something, whether it be by voting or choosing to not eat beef. And yes, these choices are great. But more needs to happen, on a grander scale, outside of people's eating habits and lifestyles. I hope to see that great change in my lifetime. I hope that when I am 60 I can be proud of my generation. But if not, I hope that the next generation will be able to make the changes that my generation failed to do. That sounds so incredibly sad because it seems like I am using boomer logic. I don't want to dump the problems onto the next generation and to prevent that, everyone must envison a greater world and act on it.

Dear Future Daughter/Son,

                                <br><br>

Today is March 12th, 2020. We are currently in a climate crisis, as well as a pandemic of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). Recently, we just had the primary election for the 2020 President. Bernie Sanders is the only presidential candidate that endorsed The Green New Deal. He won California, but he didn't win many other states. This is really unfortunate because other candidates (Joe Biden and Donald Trump) simply do not care about the well-being of our environment. Donald Trump, our current president, supports fossil-fuel companies and only cares about revenue for big oil companies. If a candidate other than Bernie Sanders becomes our president, I expect our world to worsen in its climate crisis state. I hope that whoever is your current president cares about our environment and the health of our planet rather than just the prosperity of our economy. I understand that our economy is important and must be protected as well, but we won't have an economy without our planet. I hope that by the time you read this, our environment is thriving and looking better than it is right now.
                                <br><br>


I hope that by the time you're reading this, young women everywhere around the world have access to basic education. As of now, many developing countries do not educate their women on contraceptives and reproduction. This has led to an increase in population, but not enough resources to feed them all. I hope that everyone around the world has access to healthcare and food. In the United States, healthcare is not universal. Many people do not have access to healthcare because of its high price and their inability to afford it. Many people are also hungry and don't have enough food to feed themselves. This is absolutely ridiculous when there are so many millionaires that have "McMansions" and flaunt their unnecessary wealth. I hope that when you're reading this, we have switched to a more socialist society and give everyone an equal chance to thrive and live. 
                                <br><br>


I am a little pessimistic that these things will happen by 2060, but one can only hope. If things continue on as they are right now, I don't think there will be a future world for you to live in. I hope that you are living in a greener world with more accessibility to basic human needs and rights. I hope to live long enough to see a mended planet and to have my descendants live in a healthy earth.

Hello citizens of the US. It is your president speaking. I would like to relay an emergency message. Everyone must get to the highest point they can. Due to our former administrations' complete lack of care for the climate crisis, we have multiple hurricanes closing in on the United States caused by the drastic change of climate. This will lead to immense amounts of flooding, and many homes will be lost in the wake of these hurricanes. Yes, we implemented a Green New Deal in 2050, but there was no stopping what was already done. Our permafrost is melting and leaking methane into our atmosphere that will continue climate change no matter what we do. This message serves as an apology, from the United States government, to its people we have betrayed, and to the people around the world who are suffering consequences that our nation has helped beyond proportion to cause. We sealed our fate in the presidential election of 2020 when we elected that president who failed to implement a Green New Deal when it could've had a fighting chance.
                                <br><br>
Two score years ago, I was a young man studying Economics at the University of California Santa Barbara, a beautiful campus located on the oceanside of Santa Barbara/Isla Vista. Ten years ago it was shut down completely, as many buildings have fallen into the ocean due to the erosion it has seen with the rise in sea level. It was there that I first learned about the dire situation we faced with our climate. At that time, it had been known for 60 years that humans were causing climate change, and we still were doing little about it. Now, 100 years after that, our time for action has passed. Our species will likely face our demise in the next few centuries. This is not a message to get complacent though. It is still essential to continue our actions in being as carbon negative as possible, in order to prolong our existence for our children and if we're lucky, their children.  After that, I'm not sure how much of the world will be left.
                                <br><br>
This message is being watched around the world. I would like to say hello to the peoples of other nations. We are sorry. It truly is the United States' fault that we are in this situation. Europe had executed a transfer to renewable energy and plant based food beautifully and managed to become carbon negative by 2040. China and the rest of Asia followed suit with the entirety of Asia being carbon neutral by 2053. In fact, the United States is the only major carbon contributor who has still not hit a carbon neutral point. While we should hit it within the next two years, all it does is lengthen our time on this planet shortly.
                                <br><br>
At my time at university I read an article by David Wallace Wells entitled "The Uninhabitable Earth." In it, he laid out potential scenarios our world could hit if we did not stop climate change. Many called him an alarmist, dismissed his ideas, and others lost hope reading his horrifying words. Well, today I have yet to come across a more correct piece of writing on how climate change is turning out, and how it will, inevitably turn out. 
                                <br><br>
To those of you who in the past ten years realized the situation we were in, and only then chose to support the effort to end climate change, shame on you. You have come too little too late. We needed your support when this was just beginning, and many of you shunned us. 
                                <br><br>
To those of you who have been working towards saving this planet for the past century, our hearts and the hearts of millions of Americans are with you. We are sorry that we did not unite in the way that is necessary. Please continue to spread the love you have for this planet to its citizens as many will need it in this hard time. 
                                <br><br>
That will conclude this message. Please stay safe and we will be updating the country as needed.

The year was 2020. I don’t think we fully realized how vital this year was at the time. We knew we needed to take action, and we knew we were running out of time. I should clarify though when I say “we”. Believe it or not, there was a wide population of Americans who did not believe in climate change at the time. One of them was our president. I know this sounds insane, but it was our scary reality. I wasn’t even fully aware of the crisis we were in until I took a class called Climate Crisis 101 in my freshman year of college. I quickly realized throughout the course the urgent and devastating truths of the climate crisis and how pressing taking action really was. Another wake-up call that happened that year was the fire that encroached close to campus causing classes to be canceled. Suddenly, before my eyes, I saw the reality of our lives in flames and the tangible effects of this worldwide crisis. I started to realize how many of the activities ingrained into my lifestyle were detrimental to our planet. I was a meat-eater, contributing heavily to the release of methane into the atmosphere. I supported fast fashion, having terrible effects on both human factory workers' lives and our planet. I was a frequent-flyer, blowing my carbon budget through the roof. All these activities enlightened me to realize how cultural this issue was. It was not purely scientific, it was political and cultural and needed to be seen as such. I’m just so thankful we took action when we did because if we didn’t, we would have betrayed your generation, bringing you into a world we killed. 
                                <br><br>
How did we do it? Well, I’ve introduced the climate crisis, so now I might as well tell you what we did about it. I can start with what I personally did, as personal action is the catalyst to worldwide change. Well as I already mentioned, my journey started in that first environmental lit class I took on a whim that winter quarter in 2020. Inspired by that class and moved to act, I decided to become an environmental studies major. I wanted to commit my higher education to learn about and acting on the climate crisis and everything it surrounds. Along this journey, I made many changes to the way in which I lived my everyday life. I started this by eating a largely plant-based diet with the ideals of climatarianism and freeganism in play as well. I wanted to eat in a way that was conscious of my health and my planet. I cut out meat and paid attention to what was in season, the sources of my nutrition, and a huge factor was limiting my food waste. I started composting at home and tried to limit my use of single-use plastics. I started to become more of a minimalist and I stopped supporting fast fashion. I realized that retail therapy was a very detrimental habit to fall into and I became content with what I had. When I really did need something, I would do my best to thrift or support local businesses and sustainable makers. I also coupled all of this with arguably one of the most important actions: Political Action. I not only voted for those with policies in favor of fighting the climate crisis but I also campaigned for those and spread information about how others could do the same. Another change I made that I have UCSB to thank for was riding my bike. I fell in love with riding my bike while at the school, and realized it would be very environmentally friendly of me to never give up this hobby. I ended up never buying a car, and getting around through public transport and biking. 
                                <br><br>
 Another greatly important aspect of action prompted in 2020 was political and societal on a scale larger than personal action. We all knew that personal action was great, but we also knew that it wasn’t going to be enough. It came down to widespread political and cultural changes implemented in developed countries to really make the impact we needed. A huge factor of this was the 2020 elections where democrats regained control, taking back the Senate and the Whitehouse. The Green New Deal was implemented as a first step and society were changed in many great ways. A carbon tax was put into play on all Americans which highly discouraged car use, flights, and fossil fuel mining. Our public transit system was improved in great measures and we got safe and reliable bike paths, so one could safely and realistically bike as a main form of transportation. We educated more girls in developed countries which was monumental for women's rights in general and for population control with sex education and access to free birth control for all. There were so many win-wins that helped mitigate the climate crisis but also just improved society for the better. We thought it wasn’t possible, but if we had kept that attitude it never would have been. 
                                <br><br>
 So, yes, we have made huge steps towards the dissolving of the climate crisis and the path away from mass-extinction. Am I saying everything is perfect and there is no more work to be done? Absolutely not. We still made irreversible damage to our planet and that is something that we will always have to be actively resolving. The moment we become complacent and think that all the work has been done, we are in trouble. We have come a long way but there is always work to be done and I am so proud of my generation for being the push behind the start of that change.

Dear future self,
                                <br><br>
I began my freshman year at UCSB uneducated on the depth of environmental studies and the solutions that are left hidden by huge companies. I like many others believed that I was saving the planet by changing my light bulbs, having a reusable water bottle, taking fast showers, and making sure to recycle. Little did I know the other lifestyle choices I was doing were causing tremendous impacts that greatly outweighed the others. For example I learned of a solution that began at the breakfast table. I was eating meat, dairy and other animal products that were causing not only horrible impacts to the planet but also my health. I did not know that I could eat lentils at a fraction of the amount of emissions of a piece of meat. This was a cultural aspect I had to shift. While at school it was easy for me to choose a diet that was focused around climate friendly foods. But when I went home for breaks I had a really hard time with my family. My dad was constantly buying “my favorite” foods and I kept having to remind him I was not eating them anymore. But he soon realized and when I would cook dinners he enjoyed everything I would make. 
                                <br><br>
  As my knowledge grew on the horrible impacts that my lifestyle had on the planet I began to shift my lifestyle. I had always been the one in my friend group who was looking for the best clothing deal. I would always show my friends all the clothes that I got and how I only paid this much for it. It was not that I did not like the nice quality items I just thought that I needed a lot of items, and to fulfill this they had to be cheap. But I quickly realized that these products were cheap in two ways, money and quality. Not just this but they created horrible impacts on the workers in developing countries. I quickly realized a cheap t-shirt is not worth the suffering of a poorly treated employee. I transitioned my spending habits and began only paying for items that were made sustainably or second. Doing this I would often save money, because I would think before I bought something. I would not just buy stuff and let it sit in the back of my closet. Instead I bought less and found myself wearing outfits I really loved and took care of. 
                                <br><br>
 Another factor I began to implement into my lifestyle was driving less. Again being at school this was really easy. I rode my bike or walked everywhere except when I would take the bus to the grocery store. But all of these are better options than when I was in high school and would drive alone to and from school every day. Having cars was another cultural issue I had seen myself tied into. I like many others felt a sort of freedom when I would be able to drive. But seeing the horrible environmental cost along with the annual cost that I would pay to drive does not seem worth it to me. This began to re spark my interest in moving to a city. Ever since I was little I had always dreamed of moving to New York or another big city. I now hope to do that when I graduate. I not only think it would help because a car would be unnecessary, but it also helps with the issue of huge houses. In many cities homes are much smaller when helps to reduce the environmental impacts as well.
                                <br><br>
The hardest issue that I do and am not able to overcome yet is travel. Like many other people I have always dreamed of traveling across the world. But I am taken back by the horrible impact it causes. I hope that soon I will discover that travel does not need to be across the world. That there are amazing places in towns not too far from myself that I am able to go and explore.
                                <br><br>
Finally, the greatest thing this class taught me is the importance of my vote and along with that communication. That I could make so many lifestyle changes, but the world revolves around fracking and it will not stop until people vote against it. I hope that everyone will realize this and vote against it. But I know one thing's for sure my friends and I will be voting for people who support green energy and environmental candidates at every level. I hope by the time I re read this in 40 years the world has changed. That most importantly the change comes from a shift in attitude. Hopefully everyone is able to agree on the FACT that climate change is an issue that is not going to stop if we do not change our lifestyles.

To my beloved kids,
                                <br><br>

It is the year 2060 and it has become clear that the world will never recover from the effects of climate change. Back in 2020, when I was at UCSB learning about the climate crisis, I was contemplating if we would ever be able to mitigate climate change. While I was hopeful, I knew that big change would need to happen all around the world for global greenhouse gas emissions to actually go down. During this time, many people were talking about climate change and there were many protests to curb it, but it was not a topic often spoken of when it came to the people in power. I remember taking part in the important Election of 2020 when America could have elected a candidate that supported taking great action towards fighting the climate crisis but instead chose Trump to take a second term in office. Following this election, it became clear that climate change would be giving us a hard time. Natural disasters and disease were rampant all around the world following this election yet the administration refused to address the possibility that these devastating disasters and diseases could be a symptom of climate change. Young activists like Greta Thunburg, whom I’m sure you've read in your history books, continued to speak out against leaders who were not doing anything. While she was able to greatly impact the media, it was not enough to actually convince leaders to implement sanctions on greenhouse gas emissions. While Americans were sympathetic to the cause and understood at least in basic terms the negative effects that climate change would spring upon them, they were not willing to truly make the changes necessary to combat it. To them not flying and eating meat was too big a sacrifice. Because Americans were not adamant enough to change their lifestyles, the rest of the world followed in our footsteps and likewise did not change theirs. To make matters worse, America emitted unheard of levels of greenhouse gasses in an attempt to fuel the economy and regain the country’s status of wealth and prosperity, which was taken away because of the diseases and disasters. Of course, as you know, this never happened. Because of the rampant disease and endless poverty, Americans no longer had the option to prioritize climate change because catastrophic hunger was ubiquitous. America’s singular focus was on finding new sources of food and cures for the deadly diseases that have been released as a result of Antarctica melting. In order to solve this problem, the entire Amazon Forest was deforested. Plantations for food were set up and millions of people were relocated because of rises in sea level that wiped out their homes. Today, global extinction rates are peaking and many species of animals no longer exist. It is heartbreaking to understand that you will never get to see my favorite animal from when I was a child, the giraffe, in person. While I did speak up about climate change and vote to support candidates who understood climate change, it was not enough. The majority of Americans just didn’t see it as a big enough issue. To me, there was nothing more important than being able to provide you guys with a world that was habitable and beautiful. I am so sorry that I let you down and now you have to live in a world that 2020 me would not be able to recognize.

For the future myself                                <br><br>

Well if you can still see this article, you have already been more than 50 years old, an old man. I am you in your 20s. I don’t know what the future will be like, not mine, but the fate of the whole generation and the fate of this planet. I can only do some prediction and the others are left for you to determine if I am correct Lmao. In 2020, democrats will be elected to presidency, and they will pass the green new deal and many other environmental protection laws. However, locally in places like Texas and Florida, local laws are not passing environmental protection regulations, and coastal areas will be submerged in 2030s. The coastal lines will be pushed inwards for more than 10 kilometers inwards, and the university you attended will be not there anymore, and no more campus corner, where you used to think about the universe and cosmology. I will be an astrophysicist, and I love my job. However, you have been keeping track of the environmental protection. I am a fatalist and never believe we humans can solve the problem. I tend to believe that the Fermi’s paradox produces an outcome that we all tend to deny: civilizations cannot be detected by us because they last for relatively short time, and there would be a turning point for all intelligent creatures that the exhaust of resources exceed the activity range and technological development. Or technology never matters. It is the intrinsic nature of humanity’s greed that leads to final extinction. Hope that will not be true. However, from my situation here, I would think that the future is harsher than ever. The cities are crowded with refugees, and area conflicts arise. There might be wars and people will have no time even to take action towards environmental protection. I will be an astrophysicist. Even though techs cannot save us, I would like to agree techs can save humanity as a generation, even if the chances are trivial. I would march towards it, and I want to know if it is still your goal for research. To push the boundaries of human’s recognition of the universe and the interstellar spacecraft, to the least and worst condition, leave a clue that humanity ever existed in this universe. We need to face the fact maybe at that time, and maybe you are designing spacecrafts and maybe like interstellar, the government needs to do it secretly. I want to know if you feel desperate, or everything is good and sustainable development isn’t merely  the words on congress documents. 
                                <br><br>
Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night. The words from interstellar and also the famous poet. For the old man, for myself.

To my kids 
                                <br><br>
If you are reading this, then that at least means my life is not so bad. I am going to have a family, a wife that love or loved me, and kids, for sure. What we can leave you is a hell. I feel quite sorry, because we humans do not want to act until the deadlines are approaching. Just like what you may do, finish the homework right before the due date. Or if you are good boys and girls, doing everything in advance. I hope even in my youth that the blue sea, bright sky, leisure life, you guys will experience the same. But I know it is not possible. Your generation will possibly be the last generation ever on this planet, this little miracles blue ball. It is too cruel to say this and you are too small to understand. The despair you guys will feel will be beyond my imagination. You guys may die miserably, which is a better case, or live till the last, witnessing the doom of our species, the worst thing I can dream about. However, I am not regretful, because I see so many people trying to save the planet and with my contribution, we can sustain the planet to your generation. There are so many trying their best or even sacrifice their lives for environmental protection. You shouldn’t blame us because humans cannot change, given the same situation, we do similar things. What I can say and do is to teach you astronomy. It is not to say that this can save the planet, but this can at least provide a bit of hope, the light among the shadows. So dim the light that we know it cannot be possible to save us. However, pursuing the light at least prevents you from sitting there waiting for your destiny.

Dear kids,                                 <br><br>

 You’re not old enough to read yet, but I feel like things are finally getting better. If I am being completely honest, your brother was a mistake. Sorry! A happy mistake, but nevertheless, a mistake. Back in 2020, the climate crisis was bad, but for some reason, the majority of the world wasn’t avidly taking action, which includes myself. Climate change was always something on the back burner for me. People who didn’t do anything either didn’t believe global warming was real (I know!! It’s crazy!) or gave up hope of saving our planet. I was the latter. But then, I enrolled into English 23, and my lifestyle/way of thinking changed. I learned about so many eye opening things, and I shared the information with so many people that someone thought I was an environmental science major. One of the reasons I never really took action in saving our planet was the inconvenience and downgraded lifestyle that I thought I would have to live. However, through taking English 23, I was surprised about what a practical and more happy life I could be living. For example, one of the main topics we discussed was consumerism culture. Bigger is better. More is better. One of our assignments pertaining to happiness around the world shows us otherwise. I really liked how my professor gave us realistic solutions, such as living in the city to reduce our transportation and housing carbon footprint. Thus, I decided to implement these actions into my life. I began to recycle more, waste less food, and eat more plant based foods. Every time I went online shopping, I refrained myself from buying anything, which was crazy considering how much I used to shop. I knew that I had enough clothes and stuff, and I should only buy things that I knew would be used often and last long. Every time I went to Starbucks (which was often), I would bring my reusable cup and straw to reduce my waste! I also decided to only have one kid too, so sorry but you really came out of nowhere. Lastly, I voted. I never registered to vote until my 20’s because I didn’t think my vote would matter. But after taking the class, I learned that if you don’t have a lot of time, you can vote which is what I told all my friends and family. 
                                 <br><br>
Finally, as I persisted with my own personal actions and activism, people finally came to their senses and did so too. Not everyone but honestly enough. Enough for something along the lines of the Green New Deal to pass! So now, we live in the city in a big enough apartment for the four of us. I emphasize on big enough because consumerism culture is beginning to die down. It’s great living in the city because all my friends live in the same building, and you know, sometimes you toddlers are too much. It’s also nice when dad and I go on date nights. Now that the public transportation system has upgraded a lot since I went to college, we never miss our dinner reservations. However, even though our public transportation has improved, I still would rather walk instead. Everything is so close, and the view walking is nice since they began “greening” the city. The US is also reaching out to different underdeveloped countries to help pave the way in helping save our planet. Anyways, I hope things continue to change for the better, and I’m happy that what I thought were small useless actions made a difference because now you don’t have to worry about saving the planet. My generation and I already got started. I also hope you kids become easier to take care of too. 
                                <br><br>
Love, Mom

                                <br><br>

The year is currently 2020 and the Green New Deal has not been fully enforced yet. You took this class (ENG23) your freshman year of college hoping to satisfy the GE requirement area E, but you have found the class more interesting and informational than you could have ever imagined. This class and all of its assigned reading, documentaries, and videos have affected you every single week when you complete the homework. I hope you still remember the effects of these documentaries and how you were motivated to change the way you live to cater towards the environment. Two weeks age from today's date (March 9, 2020) you decided to give up meat altogether to see if you can do it for a long period of time. Currently it hasn't been hard yet because I know that I'm doing it for a cause that is greater than my own self. But, I hope that in future, my efforts to try and save the planet has inspired others or even made a dent in the way the environment is advancing. 
                                <br><br>

I hope that in the future, people will wake up and realize that the world we live in is not a magic orb that just gives us resources whenever we need it. I hope that people will realize the situation that we are in right now and act so our future children can live comfortably as we did on fossil fuels. We should be selfless and create an environment where our children can enjoy their lives on earth just how we did, but with less fossil fuels, haha.
                                <br><br>

I hope the world is green as ever!

The earth you know today was not always like this. When I was young, the planet was beautiful, but in a different way. It was green, and flowery, and most Americans enjoyed the natural beauties of the world, like clean beaches and forests. Americans also chased the “American Dream” so they worked hard to afford large houses and expensive cars. They were proud of purchasing abundant amounts of clothes, shoes, and other unnecessary things. They didn’t really care much about their diet, cows overtook most of America’s land, and people threw out most of the food produced. No one worried about conserving energy or polluting the air, even though most people knew that our earth was in danger. More so in the 2000s, facts about the climate crisis became more widespread. I first heard about it when it was still called “global warming” so us kids thought the earth was just getting hotter. Many denialists including Trump, made fun of the climate crisis, pointing out how regions were still cold, so that somehow made the climate crisis fake. When I reached highschool and even more so when I began college, the climate crisis became one of the most prominent issues of debate. Many Americans refused to understand how the climate crisis was real and was putting the entire world in danger, and instead they focused on partisan politics and made the environment another topic to argue about. They didn’t want to realize that we had no time to argue; catastrophic effects were already happening and more were to come if we didn’t do anything.
                                <br><br>

Greenhouse gases including CO2 and methane were the ones to blame, but behind them us humans were actually causing all the destruction. Humans were greedy, they knew these gases were detrimental for the planet, but they released them anyway in the pursuit of more money. Everything was always about money. Companies centered around fracking, coal mining, and raising cattle were releasing the deadly methane gas into the air; while Americans continued to purchase gas for their cars, use coal to cook, and eat immense amounts of beef, these companies continued running and earned millions in the meantime. Animals were dying and almost became extinct, disrupting entire ecosystems. Cities were flooding and people were also dying, and had to move their entire home and lives. Natural disasters like storms and fires not only became more frequent but more terrible in size and impact. Meanwhile, instead of coming together to save not only ourselves but our planet and other animals, many people tried to deny climate change was happening right in front of them, or they admitted they had to do something, but were moving way too slow to help. Denialists were trying to keep large fossil fuel companies afloat, making the rich richer at the expense of every living thing on the planet. They claimed climate scientists were liars, and decided the earth was fine and they wanted to keep their jobs and ‘free’ lives which only oppressed those in the poorest countries. The US, Europe, and Russia were producing ⅔ of all CO2 in the atmosphere, but people in the poorest parts of the world were feeling the climate crisis’ effects the worst. The earth seemed doomed, the U.S.was split in half on which side to take. Older generations were more reluctant to support sweeping legislations like the Green New Deal, and at the time the president of the most powerful country in the world decided he didn’t want to believe in climate change, because he too was only interested in money. People grew frustrated, it felt as if there were no hope.
                                <br><br>

And then, in a long, tiring, and almost endless year, Democrats won the presidency in 2020. I was in my first year of college, and most people on my largely liberal campus were stoked. The world was in shock, but most of America rejoiced. The Green New Deal was passed the following year after Bernie took his oath, and America began working hard to save the planet. We led the world with renewables, new inventions and technology such as top notch wind turbines, electric cars, effective fast trains, and refrigerants that greatly reduced our carbon footprint. Reducing the sale of beef was implemented, and a push towards a plant rich diet spread across the country and eventually the world. There were laws set in place to restrict cutting down rainforests, and birth control and abortion became available to women which helped keep the population relatively stable. All of these crucial changes and more weren’t easy though, and there was much backlash against the government. Americans are stubborn and rejected being told what to do, but they also had a right to be afraid. Thousands of people lost their jobs, but the Green New Deal made sure to protect them. And soon after its implementation, thousands of new jobs were created. The economic shift was difficult, but eventually America became accustomed to the changes, and other countries followed our lead. I am proud to say, we saved the planet, and I am happy you and future generations get to enjoy it.

To Whom it May Concern,                                <br><br>

If you open this letter, I think civilization still exist after all the difficulties the planet and the human societies been through. 
                                <br><br>
For my generation, the best way to positively affect climate crisis is to use knowledge to share and implement solutions to yourself and people who surround you. Small changes of lifestyle could add up as a great influence on climate crisis. For my opinion, a minimalist lifestyle is interesting to me and help the excessive consumption. 2020 is a tough year that starts with natural disasters and corona virus, many countries are suffering and struggling from plenty problems. For natural disasters, I think the campfire for months happened in Australia is an alarm to all people that the planet is under tremendous suffers. 
                                <br><br>


I hope the planet still has clean resources of air, water and safe shelters, if not, I hope there were solutions to ease climate crisis and rebuild human societies. Back to 2020, people are more aware of environment problems, but it could be too late. There are plenty serious difficulties happened for the last few decades and 2020 just one of the worst. I strongly recommend you pay more attention to long-term happiness instead of mainstream culture by exploiting resources. However, I believe the suggestions I gave are not for saving the planet but saving human from extinction. There was more extreme weather in the human history, but the planet survives and still feed many different species. Species besides humans adapt the environment to continue while human beings hardly evolve for the past centuries. Therefore, I think human beings really need to ease the current climate crisis to save ourselves from extinctions.

To whomever stumbles upon this letter,

                                <br><br>

It is currently 2070, and the planet has been so damaged by human actions it can no longer be saved. I am sending this letter back in time to the year 2020---the most important and pivotal election year in the United States history---in hopes of changing the future for the better. 

                                <br><br>

When I look outside my window now, I can only see grey, smoggy skies and people wearing industrial particulate-filtering masks. Blue, clear skies are a thing of the past now---in fact, I haven’t seen one since 2035. More and more babies are born with birth defects every year, cancer rates are sky high. The once beautiful and active oceans are now bleak and lifeless, as most marine life forms have gone extinct due to the increasing acidity. The increase of natural disasters and rising sea levels have forced humanity to retreat further in-land and build higher and higher in hopes of escaping the acidic sea. Many countries and islands no longer exist, and the fight for the remaining and scarce natural resources have only intensified. 

                                <br><br>

It is now too late to change our fate. Humanity’s numbers are plummeting too quickly and it’s only a matter of time until we face our extinction like the rest of Earth’s plants and animals. The rich---the people who caused this climate disaster in the first place---have already fled to Mars and escaped the full brunt of the damage, leaving behind the poor people who did nothing to deserve their current fate. This is the most infuriating fact of all: the people who perpetrated the climate crisis faced no consequences and the people who were innocent are now left to die.

                                <br><br>

I am writing this letter in hopes that humanity can realize the dangers of climate change and quickly enact changes before it is too late. While it is too late for us to change our fate, it is not too late to change yours. In 2020, elect politicians who believe in the climate crisis and most importantly, are willing to enact change despite opposition from “oiligarchies” and other anti-green corporations. In addition to that, try to convince the general population to lessen their carbon footprint by switching to a “climatarian” diet and using public transportation and bikes instead of cars. Maybe if all this is achieved, we won’t be resigned to the fate of a dead planet.
                                <br><br>


While this letter may seem unrealistic or maybe even a prank, I beg you and your generation to vote out the fossil fuel-serving politicians and elect in people with ideals like Bernie Sanders or AOC. We shouldn’t be focusing on trivial matters like gun rights when our planet is at stake.

                                <br><br>

Good luck and godspeed ahead

To my children: 
                                <br><br>

Hi there babies (even though you aren’t babies right now)! I’m writing this letter to you for two reasons. 1. It’s an assignment for a course I am currently taking, English 23, at UC Santa Barbara and 2. I didn’t really want to write to myself. So let me tell you a bit about this class (i’m sorry if you’ve already heard me talk about this class many times before). The class was literally titled “Climate Crisis 101.” In it, I learned the ways your grandma’s generation knew about the climate crisis and the ways they could have prevented it from getting as worse as it did when I was in my late teens to twenties. For instance, during my first year and first quarter in college, Santa Barbara was faced with one of the worst and largest in California in 2017. This fire did not start because someone’s bonfire accidentally went wild, the fire started because of high winds in the area caused power lines to hit against each other and start a fire. The fire ravaged a great portion of Ventura county. It was hard to breathe, the sky red for about two weeks. People, including myself, fled their homes (in my case, 3-person dorm) away from the fires. However, a little less than a year later, the largest fire in California history happened in Butte county killing eighty-five people. I share this with you as a reminder of how things once were, and how it inspired me and countless of others in my generation to create a habitable Earth for the future generations, plants, and animals. I share this with you because it is when I told myself I had to do something. 
                                <br><br>

By now, more people will have changed the way they live their lives as a result of the Green New Deal. One of those people who changed their living habits is me. I will be honest with you, my transition to my way of living and eating the way I do now did not happen overnight. It took coming to college, meeting people who did not eat meat, being faced with a wildfire, and taking classes centered around the climate and climate justice to reflect on my consumption of meat and sh*t I did not need. I tell you this as a reminder that with any change in life, change does not happen overnight and certainly not happen if there is no dedication and commitment for that change to happen. I am currently (as a 20 year old) beginning to weed out meat products out of my life for more plant-based options. It was hard for me to cut meat entirely out of my life, especially since many yummy Filipino dishes I grew up with include meat (like kare-kare and sinigang). However, I was dedicated to being able to enjoy Filipino food without meat included and went through many trial and errors of dishes to get to what we eat today. I use the car a lot less than what I used to as a 20-year old. I used to drive everywhere without thinking of the environmental costs of doing so. 
                                <br><br>

Aside from my personal actions, my generation was the generation that got their act together and tackled the climate crisis. We voted Bernie Sanders into office which led the end of Trump, which I am more than sure you have heard of his terrible four years by now. Bernie Sanders was the person we desperately needed in office then especially with the climate crisis at its tipping point. We had to act fast. Bernie backed the Green New Deal which helped it pass. 
                                <br><br>

I hope that this letter has been helpful in some way to see how things once were and how they should not go back to. I share the story of the fires to make sure that history does not repeat itself and your generation reverts the work my generation put in to save the world. I hope this letter inspires you to rethink your current living habits, and change in places where you see change possible.

To Dear Myself,                                <br><br>

How time flies. I cannot believe it is 2060 now. There are dramatic changes happening on the planet for the past 40 years. During 2030, the Earth suffered a lot, and finally to the bottom and rebounded. Human beings faced the punishment from the nature, a lot of people died. Tsunami, fire, typhoon, even virus all come. Fortunately, we finally stepped out from the miserable period. Because of this, the government rethink the importance of protecting environment and enact new environmental law referring to the Green Deal published in the past. It is a long-term process. The government increases the proportion of carbon tax in all taxes to limit the use of cars and planes. The public transportation become very popular now. They are convenient and become more comfortable than past year. Besides, Google had invented an amazing app which can record people’s daily carbon footprint and their maximum annul carbon footprint. It is something like Fibit which can record people’s health status. People can download it free into their apple watch or phones. I am using this app now, and I feel proud that my individual carbon footprint is below 4 tons, the global average carbon footprint. Thanks to the scientists, they put a lot of efforts in trying make the low-carbon vegetables have the taste of meat. It really saves people’s stomach and efficiently decrease the carbon emission from feeding the livestock.
                                <br><br>

Besides, people also pay more attention on the wild animals near extinction. It is so sad to tell you that the coral reefs are all dead in 2040s because of the oil pollution in the ocean. The extinction of coral reefs makes the marine ecosystem become chaotic. Huge number of species are going to the end.  For this, marine experts raise the deal that each country should totally stop fracking things in next 20 years to help the ocean be clean again. As a region already experience the oil spill, Santa Barbara support the deal strongly. At that time, I travel to UCSB and see a lot of students do the protest and collection. I donate some haha! At the same time, experts created artificial coral reefs, which imitate the characteristics of coral reefs for some small fishes like tropical fish to inhabit. It is really amazing invention. In 2060, the ocean is thoroughly cleaned up. I hope our future generation can remember how destructive the fracking is, taking this as a lesson.
                                <br><br>

Though humans made some mistakes in the past, people try their best to solve the evil consequence. I feel worthy that I have taken ENGL 22 and 23 in UCSB when I was a freshman. These two courses provide me too many reflection and thoughts about the climate crisis. I learned the darkness behind the fashion factory. I learned the huge amount of carbon emission of air travel. I learned climate crisis is just around us, everyone needs to take actions and everyone has the ability to take actions. Perhaps just starting from a vegetable-based breakfast, starting from taking bus instead of driving a car, starting from voting for the green policy, just do it. You can do it. Meanwhile, telling people surrounding you to join you. 
                                <br><br>

2020 is an important year. Protect yourself. Living splendidly. Doing what you want to do. Having a nice year!

In 2020, I took a class that changed the way I thought about the large impact humans have upon the Earth. I learned that we take the Earth's resources and beauty for granted, stripping from it and stealing what is not ours it until the consequences are too large to ignore. It is only when these effects rear their ugly head and begin to punish us when we will begin to ask the question of what went wrong, but honestly this is a question that needed to have been asked a long time ago to prevent these problems from happening at all. Fortunately for us here in 2060, we asked ourselves this very question right upon the cusp of disaster and took the necessary steps of tackling the issue of climate change. Now, we are leading better lives because of it. None of this could have happened if it was not for the persistence and activism of my generation and those who supported our cause, and it is because of our collective efforts that we have a clean planet capable of supporting life up till this day. No longer must we worry about our cities fading due to rising sea levels or underprivileged people working overseas to produce unsustainable clothing at the cost of their lives. It was a hard battle to get to this point, but we all did our part to ensure that the fate of humanity and all life on earth was a good one.
                                <br><br>

Personally, I think that I've changed the most ever since I left that fateful class. I recognized that for 19 years up until that point I had been filling up my life with useless, materialistic clutter that served no purpose in my life apart from emptying my bank account. Happiness sure as hell doesn't come from buying the latest style of jacket or the prettiest earrings and it took a long period of self reflection to come to this conclusion. I started small by slowly emptying my closet and miscellaneous items that were taking space of my room, either using online marketplaces to resell them to people who had more use for them or donating them to reputable organizations who would make sure that the clothes actually ended up in the hands of other people (and not festering somewhere in a landfill). I had to research these companies to ensure these items were in good hands, but I do not consider that time wasted because it was for a good cause and made me more well informed about who truly cares when it comes to things like donations/charity. When I did have to shop out of necessity, I preferred saving up for more expensive sustainable clothing rather than opting for poorly made fast fashion pieces. It felt good knowing that the clothes I wore were not only stylish but also untainted by the blood and suffering of another human forced to produce it for me who likely got a barely livable wage to support themselves. Knowing that good ingredients that did not damage the environment through contamination or resource destruction also made me feel better about what I was wearing. As it turned out, I also ended up feeling more of a connection and held value for the things that I continued to keep, which was better than hoarding a bunch of clothes that would never see the light of day once the initial excitement of owning them wore off. For me, this was one of the biggest changes in my life and one that corresponded with my ethics as well.
                                <br><br>

Another large change I tried to make in my life was being more conscious about the way I travelled and lived. My car stayed in the garage for a large period of time used only for emergencies or trips where there was a time pressure, but other than that my trusty bike was what I relied on the most. Growing up, so often I had seen my parents take the car to get groceries or household items at stores that were less than a mile away from where we lived so I had assumed that was what I would have to do as an adult too since there was so much to carry. However, it makes more sense to bike with something like a rear and front basket to carry things and reduce my carbon footprint. Doing this also forced me to think long and hard about what was absolutely necessary for me to buy and what I could live without since there was an obvious size limit of things I could carry on my bike. In this way, I was both limiting the amount of waste I produced (food and trashwise) and also reducing the amount of emissions I produced by reducing car use. Biking has also helped me retain a healthier figure at my age and given me a reason to stay active, which is beneficial for me overall. In terms of where I live, I made the conscious choice to not splurge out on a giant mega mansion like I had always dreamed of doing and opt instead for a nice small house like the one I grew up in. Less space for clutter to fill up means less waste, as well as less energy being used up to keep it  habitable. This leaves more money for other things that would have been swallowed up by a large mortgage/utility bills, such as paints and canvases for my free time or better quality appliances that will last a long time in my home instead of flimsy items that need constant replacement. All in all, my living situation is a happy one filled with less stress and more time for me.The way I eat, however, has been a rockier road to rectify. I tried veganism and vegetarianism and even watched documentaries about the harsh ways of livestock treatment, but every so often after strict dieting I always ended up falling off the wagon because discipline didn't work for me. However, I found solace in climatarianism which I didn't even know was an option before this class. By weighing my options and choosing the less environmentally costly alternative knowing what I knew about emissions, I felt better about my eating choices overall in terms of the environment. I have even begun to adopt a different discipline of having a mostly plant-based diet with occasional cheat days (always choosing the more environmentally  friendly choice even then). These things have all changed my health and life for the better.
                                <br><br>

These changes, although they seem small, really were the big things that I could personally do for the Earth aside from voting for environmentally conscious politicians and joining climate rallies (which I did too). It is collective action that really drives the large scale changes we hope to see when we make lifestyle changes. Although our actions seem meaningless, the more people we convince to take action alongside us and the more we inform others of the differences they could make is all that we need to turn our lives around. Thankfully, we did this and secured the fate of life on Earth for future generations, and it is up to us to continue this trend in the future as well.

To whom it may concern: 
                                <br><br>

I am writing to you from the year 2060 and let me tell you, it doesn’t get any better. We’ve made many attempts to defeat the climate crisis but we’ve fought to no avail. The ever-increasing intelligence of technology seemed to have been the evident solution to all of our problems, but lo and behold it was proven to be largely ineffective. The production of such equipment counteracted much of our efforts. For much too long we have placed our faith on our beloved technology and now it is far too late to defeat the crisis, even with the effort of every individual living on this planet. But you, being from the year 2020, have the power to change it all. You can change your ways for the better, you can fight for your planet and secure your future.
                                 <br><br>
I know I haven’t lived much of a sustainable life and my efforts have hardly benefited the surrounding environment (if they even did at all), but you can tell a different story; you can be the change.
                                <br><br>

Now, let me tell you a little about your timeline. In a few months from now you will find that Donald J. Trump will unfortunately win the presidential election again (yes I know, even today I still refuse to admit that he was my president). The Senate is still dominated by the GOP and have since killed the Green New Deal, despite the fact that it was passed by the democratic House of Representatives. Efforts to battle the climate crisis have seen a sharp increase, but Trump, being the fascist he is, declared a national emergency against it. 
                                <br><br>
He argued that every piece of evidence presented by climate scientists who have confirmed the existence of anthropogenic climate change is “fake news.” According to him, the climate crisis is a hoax created by the “radical left” and has only served to create mass hysteria nationwide. The dude even severely cut funding for public universities that have a blue history. Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Is that even constitutional?” No, but let’s face it, the federal government doesn’t care. Also, in case you were wondering, a vaccine is made for COVID-19, shortly after 70% of the U.S. population contracted it in 2021. 
                                <br><br>


I’m urging you to vote. Although the climate crisis should not be a political issue, it unfortunately is. I know that the voting stations may seem too far, but you must get your lazy arse off your couch and vote. Do you really want to end up with baby Trump as your president again? Yeah, I didn’t think so. The fate of the nation relies on you so please, I beg of you, gather your friends and family and vote for a candidate that WILL fight for the well being of our planet, or you will regret it. 

                                <br><br>

In addition to this, you must make an effort to change your diet and invest in used clothing. I know what you’re thinking but just trust me on this. No, it isn’t gross to wear clothing that has once been worn by others because washing machines exist (and no they aren’t better in the future, they just look prettier). Forget about those Yeezys, they’re all  just the same shoe silhouettes with different colorways. Oh, and Gucci, yeah it isn’t cool anymore. And no, beef isn’t your only source of protein, other foods exist. I’m not saying you should completely switch  to a purely plant-based diet, but at least consider switching the type of meat you decide to eat. Believe me, it does make a difference. 

                                <br><br>

I am aware that it seems like I’m asking way too much from you, but really it isn’t, not if it involves your future. I’m telling you this because I made the mistake of brushing off everything I was advised to change. I was aware that the climate crisis is very much real, but I just didn’t want to change my comfortable lifestyle. If I could go back and change my decisions (no time travel doesn’t exist yet), I most definitely would. Please consider all of which I have told you, for it will determine just how healthy and safe your grandchildren are. I hope this message finds you well.

We are living in a post-modern era. Choices we make now cannot be simply for our own good, but for the collective good of our communities and our world as a whole. Not only is education vital to these ideals that protect our species, but acting upon those ideas that we learn is what will be the catalyst for change that our planet needs from us.

                                <br><br>

Right now in the beginning of 2020, we are not doing so well. Emissions stay pervasive and we just can’t seem to find our footing with everything going on. Schools, amongst other large gathering places, are being shut down as a preemptive measure to staunch the every flowing damage of a new pandemic. The stock market is crashing with interest rates going all the way down to 0 from the Federal Reserve. People are panicking, buying enough toilet paper and canned goods to build their own quarantine forts. We are already living in a dystopia, it’s not some distant imperceptible fantasy. The good thing is, even in these times of crises within crises within crises, we as humans are smart enough to come up with some pretty great, and just as many not so great, solutions. 

                                <br><br>

In order to address the issue of the climate crisis, we have a multitude of different options when it comes to counteracting our typical damaging lifestyles. We have the ability, for the most part, to make simple choices everyday that can only positively impact the environment. For one, we can all stop acting like we’re going to shit our pants on the daily and leave some toilet paper and supplies like masks etc. to the immunocompromised folks who actually have a dire necessity for these things. 

                                <br><br>

It’s an interesting parallel to draw, that between the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis, however I think it’s entirely relevant. In both cases, there’s this issue that’s intangibly monstrous and threatening to our existence as humans that we need to solve. In both cases, there are plenty of preventative measures that we can take on a daily basis to protect ourselves/our planet, but only when there is incomprehensible fear are those things utilized. Even when the resources available to us are employed, they’re either abused or not made available to folks who need them most. In the case of COVID-19, it’s become nearly impossible for older folks (those most susceptible to the disease and death by the disease) to shop for the things they need or even be able to get face masks due the amount being used by people who simply don’t need them. 

                                <br><br>

Regarding to the climate crisis, we can make choices like buying local food, using metal straws, not using plastic water bottles, etc., when we feel concerned about the impacts our lives have on the planet, but folks in developing countries (who haven’t even contributed to the majority of the damage of the climate crisis) are not offered sustainable alternatives to their everyday needs. I want to recognize that having sustainable options isn’t of concern when you’re worried simply about survival - having access to food, water, shelter and healthcare are all basic human rights that we should be focused on meeting, especially in places that will have to bear the bulk of the earthly damage we’ve done. 

                                <br><br>

I hope that in looking back on this nightmarish time period in human history, we’ll see folks came together to build solutions not just for themselves or humanity, but for the health of our beautiful earth and everything on it. We owe it to all other life on earth and to all our fellow humans to take care of each other and the place where we all inhabit. I really really hope that will be reflected in the history we create henceforth.

Dear Past Self,
                                <br><br>

I am writing to you from the year 2060, and not to freak you out, but the world is sort of in shambles. I know right now everyone’s worried about the corona virus and you are probably worried yourself, however there are worse things to come. As most may know, malaria thrives in hotter regions because of the mosquitoes who carry it but also because every degree increase in temperature, the parasite reproduces ten times faster. In 2050, 5.2 billion people had malaria. Since the global temperature rapidly increased more and more each year, a lot of permafrost has melted. In 2053, permafrost in various areas in the world melted and this disease from the ice age era returned to earth. Unfortunately, people’s immune systems didn’t know how to fight back the disease and it became a global disease outbreak. Italy took a huge hit considering that their population is a decreasing population, having way more older people than younger or middle aged people. Essentially, many people in Italy died, it wouldn’t surprise me if within the next couple decades if the Italian, the language, diminishes. 
                                <br><br>

In 2040, we were officially able to sail over the North Pole. As per usual the US is trying to profit off of yet another environmental tragedy. The US is offering cruise ship history tours to explain the history of the North Pole that was once there, but is now just broken up small pieces of ice that will soon be gone as well. Unfortunately, glaciers are no longer a thing. I never did get to see one with my own eyes, and now it’s too late. I never got to show my kids what a glacier looks like. A couple of my grandkids don’t even know what a glacier is. All of our experiences were robbed from us because of the climate crisis, which was escalated by the human race. Sure the internet has pictures of the glaciers, but that does not truly capture the beauty.
                                <br><br>

 It is not just the beauty of glaciers that were taken away from us due to the climate crisis, but people’s homes, the cities they grew up in, entire countries, just gone. You see, there’s a lot of people’s homes that were by the ocean, but because of climate change, the sea levels rose so high that it wiped out these homes completely. First Bangladesh wiped out, then Miami, and other cities and countries didn’t take too long to follow. Hundreds of millions of people lost the place they called home, and those who survived the floods were forced to migrate somewhere else in their country, or to a completely different country all together. As people started to migrate to different places, resources became scarce, competition between populations grew, and overall it became a national security issue for many countries. We even had a war on water because of scarcity of resources. It still baffles me on how even after people knew millions would be coming into the US due to their home being destroyed, millionaires and billionaires kept their mansions with numerous rooms they don’t even use. Even if they got a big house instead of a mansion maybe we would have room to provide housing for some of these refugees. But instead, many refugees are homeless. 
                                <br><br>

This year, climate change will cost taxpayers an estimate of $44 trillion. People in power made bad economic decisions that negatively impacted our environment. After the war on water in 1945, people did not know how to react, they went into a state of panic. Our president at the time, Eric Trump, decided the best thing for our economy was to put more money into oil, coal, and natural gas industries because most of our economy is based on fossil fuels. Since most people were in panic mode, they did as Eric Trump said, people started using more oil, coal, and natural gas, and just completely blew their money on anything oil, coal, and natural gas related. However, this just added to our environmental issues, causing our global temperature to increase faster than anticipated. Instead of us reaching 4-8 degrees celsius by 2100, we just hit this year 5 degrees celsius. Some people already experience pain points from the heat alone. As time goes on, the population is increasing, but the amount of grains we have are decreasing. I know back in 2020 it was not exactly normal to ration foods in the US, but it is becoming quite popular for people to do so, especially in California where we have been in what seems to be an endless intense drought for the past 4 years. To make things worse, we just recently got through a recession that was 8 times worse than the Great Recession.
                                <br><br>

Sometimes I like to imagine what the world would have been like if Bernie actually won the presidential elections in 2020 and the democrats took over the senate. Maybe people would have taken the environment more seriously. Maybe carbon taxes and the Green New Deal would have been a thing. But now only older people like myself, know what the Green New Deal even meant and what it would have done for this world. Bernie planned on putting trillions of dollars into the Green New Deal, but somehow Trump ended up winning in the 2020 presidential elections and the republicans kept the majority in the senate. Because the coronavirus continued on into the rest of 2020, people were afraid, people became more nativist, more racist. People all of a sudden became on board to Trump’s building a wall idea, well enough people at least to make it happen. Our country at this point became so polarized on everything there was no way any environmental policies were going to be passed. 
                                <br><br>

Fortunately for you, there is still hope. That thought in the back of your head of one day becoming a politician after being a lawyer, do it. Try to influence environmental policy as much as possible. Don’t just share Ken’s videos to your friends and family, but actually implement it into your lifestyle. Try to do slow travel, get food that is made locally, adopt kids that need a home because in all honesty you don’t need to bring more humans into the world when there are already kids who exist that do not have a loving home and family, try living in a tiny home or cohousing, reduce your food waste. Raise your children on these values in order to have an even deeper influence on the younger generations. The future's not set in stone for you yet. Like Merida from Brave once said, “If you had the chance to change your fate would you?”

Sincerely,                                <br><br>

<p>
The year is 2060. 40 years ago I entered my freshmen year at UCSB and decided to take ENGL 23 - The Climate Crisis with Ken as my professor. Little did you know that this class would be your first step in changing your lifestyle forever. After finishing the quarter, you remembered all the different lifestyle choices you could make in order to save the planet. 2020 was the year I stopped consuming so much beef and switched to a larger plant based diet. All my life I have been so accustomed to consuming beef, but now every time I choose to bite into that hamburger, I am more understanding of what the true costs are and how I can help. I've added more chicken into my diet to replace beef and am slowly transitioning to adding more plant based items into my diet. In 2020, I also stopped using my car as much as possible and started to bike or take the bus to most places I went. In 2020, I voted for the very first time to support a president that actually supports the fight against climate change and that is committed to defeating big fossil fuel corporations. In 2030, I moved into my newest home. This home, however, is a beautiful, modern, compact apartment in downtown LA. I've gotten a job in the big city and choose to bike my way to work everyday. After work, I stop by my favorite vegan restaurant as I've committed to an almost fully plant based diet. On my way home, I pass by all the big stores (H&M, Zara, Forever) and don't even feel the need to walk in. I've chosen a minimalist lifestyle, buying high quality clothes that will last and that I will find much benefit from rather than filling my closet with low quality t shirts. In 2040, I am a father of 2 kids, enough to replace me and my wife but not exceeding our replacement rate. We live in a small house, in a neighborhood with a great transit system. Every morning, I take my kids to school either by biking together on the cities well developed bike lanes, or by taking the bus together and walking the rest. When they come home, we go to our backyard and pick some of our freshly grown fruits and veggies and eat lunch. The kids love fruits and veggies as they have been raised from a young age to consume a largely plant based diet. In 2050, you decide to go on a family vacation to San Francisco. Due to large amounts of carbon taxing implemented by the government, air travel has largely died down in recent years. Instead, the family chooses take the train to SF, stopping by locations along the way and enjoying all parts of the California Coast. In 2060, I go out to my garden, when I look around and see all the people in my community biking around. There are a few cars on the street (all electric) but mainly the roads are filled with buses. I am grateful that I'm currently still living on this beautiful green earth due to everyone's collective action to combat climate change. I look up into the beautiful blue sky when I remember Ken and all that he taught us. I go back to his website and read this exact message I wrote myself 40 years ago. Little did I know that at the time of writing this, my life, and the world, would change for the better, ensuring the safety and well-being of our planet. I appreciate all that the class has brought me and proud that I implemented Ken's teachings throughout my last 40 years of living.

Hi babies, if you are reading this letter this means that you have graduated high-school and are in college or doing whatever your heart desires. In the year 2020 I was roughly your age around 17-19 years old and lets just say our planet was in bad shape. Our oceans were warming, the ice caps were melting, our air was full of pollution, and the white house was filled with incompetent people who couldn’t careless about the planet and its well-being. But it wasn’t all their fault, my generation and the generations before me are also at fault. We were driving cars everywhere, buying oversized homes for families of 2 or 3, buying unnecessary crap just to keep up with the latest trends, and ate meat like it was candy. And I am here to apologize for the crap we left you to deal with, I am truly sorry that my generation barely our shit(excuse my language) together and by the time we did it was almost to late. Honestly if wasn’t for taking climate courses while I was in college, I probably would’ve never how serious climate change was. I will not lie to you after first I could care less about my carbon footprint and to be honest, I didn’t even know what it was at first. 
                                <br><br>
Anyways, I’m glad to see you and your generation doing better than any generation has before you. It’s put a smile on my face to know that we left the planet in good hands. I am glad you guys are taking action and actually making a change.

2060. Human nature is a funny thing. We have outgrown the Earth, we've started building colonies on the Moon and Mars and this is just the beginning, as humans try to harness the energy of our solar system, and beyond. For all our intelligence and application though, in exploring the most obscure realms of our reality, we couldn't act upon some of the most relevant and tangible problems that where waving at us through the window, asking for our attention. That our children today think of the if age polar bears, penguins, and so many beautiful and diverse life that where once thriving on this earth, as a sort of bygone era, the modern-day equivalent of dinosaurs, could have all been averted. That so many exotic islands have become our modern Atlantis', that our world in many ways is grayer and less diverse than ever before. It pains all of us now to look back, and see how much simpler things where than we made them to be. We just had to take action, right then and there, but instead we got caught up in the small things, the daily hustle and bustle, making sure we have a nice house and car, acing those quarter earnings. And just like that, we distracted ourselves from the real essence of things, what really mattered, for no matter how intelligent we think we are, we have this one bad habit that has haunted us ever since the dawn of time - we are still animals, we get caught up in our own small realities, we forget to think about the whole, about the one. Because we are one. 
                                <br><br>

Every generation has their climate change. Wether it's ice ages, or crusades, or world wars and atomic bombs, there are have always been some things, wether man made or natural, that pose a threat to our existence and well being, and that present sources of great potential harm for life on Earth. Unfortunately, humanity has been failing far too often in addressing these generational threats. While there have been some notable successes, the deescalation of thermonuclear war of 2040 comes to mind, for the most part we have failed to consciously register the threats and move as  a collective unit to ensure our well-being. Just like in every generation, we are now faced with a new threat - these machines that we're building. They are already producing most knowledge, and taking care of most of the decisions in our daily lives. They could be a few steps away from overshooting our own intelligence, what Nick Bostrom once called becoming superintelligent and rendering us to them what we are to monkeys. The threats have been well-documented. Produce something smarter than yourself, and you may run the risk that your destiny is no longer in your own hands. With the inevitable and perpetual desire of human for progress and exploration, comes the capacity to do more good, but also more harm. The potential of our actions to cause more harm to ourselves and the rest of the life that exists around us is now higher than ever. I fear though that it is also in our natures to ignore these threats. It is imperative that we look behind us to decide the path to lay ahead of us. If history shall be repeated, then there may well not be much story left after all.

Today I want to talk to you about how it’s possible that we are all still here today. Why we can still go to our small grocery stores and find healthy food, or visit our aunt a few states over.  You know, winter break used to only be two weeks, not two months. And only schools would have breaks, not the whole population. But the world is safer now, and it’s because of my peers, and it’s important that their efforts are not forgotten, as the new generation gets too comfortable. 
                                 <br><br>

I remember summer of 2020 as we geared up for the most important presidential election for our country, when most of my liberal Californian acquaintances and I rallied for any possible way to beat Trump. We knew we needed someone in our government to stop the course America was following, and pose as a good example to the rest of the world that we are more than our material values and fossil fuels. The generation before mine was so focused on economic success that the concern for the good of its people was buried far beneath the concern for the businesses they worked for. When I was in college, it was popular to deny plastics and compost, but it wasn’t a requirement. We still spent money on gasoline for cars. There was an oilrig offshore that I could see from my balcony, and some tar in the ocean, and a steady supply of fossil fuels to ensure personal transportation. Almost everyone had cars! It was unacceptable, but the economically concerned generation controlled the law, and it felt like mine and those younger that recognized the harm that was going on had no voice in the matter. Right before that summer, there was a medical scare; my first pandemic. A lot of people were supposed to die. But that winter was short, and warm compared to others. The virus cleared up with the weather and we all continued to watch the debates and proclaim Trump to not be our president. 
                                 <br><br>

Then came November. It got cold, and people got sick. The ease with which everyone existed in warm weather generated disaster: no one was safe from the illness. The election had a small turn out, but it didn’t matter. Politicians were dropping everywhere; the United States was utterly unprepared for the health care that the pandemic demanded. However, those that were not surviving all had one thing in common: they were over 50. The majority of our government disappeared. Everyone stayed inside until April. Trump died. So did Biden. The government shut down to allow for time to reset, and life became… weird. It felt as though we returned to primal state, electricity often off to save money and we had more free time than daylight. A vaccine was created that June. A new president was elected in August, after ten months without one. Our first female president, thirty-one at the time: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 
                                 <br><br>

Since then more pandemics have occurred, and hurricanes, and wildfires, and mass deaths. But the second my generation was able to take hold of the governments of the world, our planet became the main concern. Almost every continent came together to form the international union we know today, and collectively they took action to address the true concerns of our planet. With the global loss we all faced, the competition for world power faded away with the memory of those who came before us. Quality of life became a minimal concern. Coastal areas became unsafe due to illness and ocean threats, but this was much less of a problem with the smaller population the world had. The meat industry faded, as animal crops became too difficult to manage. The government focused on the widespread agriculture education we know today, and the entire food industry transformed. I know you all know our food used to come out of factories… nonsense! We were told that our cars were to become materials for infrastructure. Air travel industry was diminished except for military, government, and absolutely necessary issues, until our air powered train was developed. Plastics were banned and electricity started to become limited. It was a time of total reform. It was a time of retreat, and of stillness. The government began to watch the Earth instead of the stock market. The free market had failed, and unnecessary businesses began to be eradicated. Some business that had been discovered to have taken part in highly immoral actions were punished, and their work criminalized. 
                                <br><br>
The international union implemented our breaks in order to allow time for healing. Initially during December, January, July, August, and September we were to live with only 3 hours of electricity and absolutely no fossil fuel travel. The world shut down, for five months every year, for 20 years. In 2045, when the air train was developed, the world felt a little more normal again, but those twenty years felt to me like going back eighty. 
                                 <br><br>

Now with our breaks less strict life feels more fun, but you wouldn’t believe the amount of unnecessary stuff we used to have to fill our time. I can say the life we have prepared for you is absolutely better. We’ve returned to our roots and acknowledged the human within us all. The world is healing; the weather is SURPRISINGLY much better. Less of the world burns, and agriculture continues. Be thankful, and water your plants.

The year is 2060 and we have taken many good steps toward fixing the climate crisis issue. I am going to talk about my own personal actions, because I believe that starting somewhere small is a good step. Since 2020, I have reduced my meat consumption by a lot and made sure to have a more plant-based diet. It was hard for the first few months, but I got through it and I'm glad I did. I shop much less, compared to how I did before 2020. I used to buy new clothes and material things as often as I could, but now I know better and the fashion companies and other retail industries have started practicing more ethical and environmentally friendly ways of production. I use public transportation as much as possible, and surprisingly, more people do too. Since we pushed for public transportation to be better, it has and more people use buses and trains rather than cars which emit so much carbon. I've promoted this kind of lifestyle to my children and it has worked. Most people nowadays are more aware of their carbon emissions and we are on a way towards a better and cleaner planet.

It's 2060, and today marks the 40 year anniversary of the global transition to a more sustainable use of the planet.  Forty years ago the Green New Deal was launched, which kickstarted the global movement to start to control our greenhouse gas emissions and move the Earth away from a climate crisis.  I still remember much of that year, 2020, as it holds some of my fondest memories.  I was a second-year hopeful earth science major at UCSB and had just begun delving into many environmental issues and what it meant to be an earth scientist.  I was developing a fierce love for the planet, especially after taking a class about the climate crisis and what I could do about it.  That class taught me so much and helped shape the person I am today.  Taking that class taught me more than I ever thought I would know, and encouraged me to make the most out of the life I was given.  I learned what it meant to be a climate warrior, and how to live in a sustainable and fulfilling way.  I remember how big that class was, and how many people it was able to impact.  I took the things that I learned from that class and did my best to educate my friends and family and encourage more sustainable lifestyles.  My friends and I would bike everywhere, as did much of the Isla Vista community.  Isla Vista was full of very like-minded and environmentally conscious people, and it took a few years for the changes that the residents of IV adapted to start to be seen around the world.  However, it didn't take long after the Green New Deal was launched for much of the world to begin changing their lifestyles.  Soon enough, you started to see more people on bikes, and cities began getting redesigned to be more bike and walking oriented, as people began to stop using their cars.  New technology made high-speed rail travel possible and affordable, and these high-efficiency low-cost modes of transportation took over when the distance to bike became too great.  It took a good amount of time, but soon the meat industry also began to go out of business.  With the shift to a more sustainable and healthy lifestyle, people turned away from processed foods and back towards a more plant-based diet.  There was also a decline in fast fashion, and soon big conglomerates began dropping like flies.  Access to birth control became more accessible, and with that, the world's population stopped exploding and has slowly been moving to a more manageable level.  I remember watching the world transition away from consumerism, and watching the people of the world unite as one to collectively save the earth.  

                                 <br><br>

Now, the year is 2060, and I've been able to watch my kids grow up in a world that was not on the brink of destruction.  The world is a beautiful and happy place, and the earth's population is a thriving community of interconnected human beings who all share the same goal, protect the earth and its environments for the many generations to come.

I think your comment was very well thought out and you mentioned a lot of important issues that need to be resolved to stop climate change like the end or a high decrease of fast fashion, the meat industry, cars, consumerism and more of a healthy environment friendly way of living. I agree that efficient and affordable public transportation besides decreasing meat production is an important step in fighting the climate crisis.I like the very optimistic outlook on the future you describe in which we stop the climate crisis and you explain the solutions.

I believe that the future is always unpredictable, but it is somehow predictable based on our current actions. The same as the climate crisis, if we want to see a notable improvement on the environment in forty years, our actions and choices now are significant to the future change. In the past forty years, human beings had done a lot of things which were harmful for the environment. People at that time did not realize that because they didn't see a bad effect. However, they couldn't think about the bad effects coming with a time difference. The climate crisis we see today is the result of continuing combined actions people did in the past forty years. As a result, two time periods are related; in this way, the future forty years are closely connected with now. 
                                 <br><br>
2020 is a big year. Human beings had already experienced flood, fires, and virus. I think a lot of disasters are the effects of climate crisis. For example, flood is formed because the increased global temperature causes glaciers at poles melted. The ecosystem is unbalanced because of the human actions. It is sad that the situation will hold for a while until our actions are able to be reflected by the nature. It may require another forty years. If we are living in 2060, we will see the result. If we take the actions to lower the climate footprints, we will find that the climate crisis is improved, otherwise the Earth will be greatly worse than now, maybe human beings are not suitable to live on the Earth anymore. 
                                 <br><br>
The course mostly talks about how to lower the climate footprint we left and the factors of emission of greenhouse gases. Ken provided a lot of solutions on reducing the carbon emission. I appreciate all things Ken taught me. The actions suggested are approachable and possible for us to start today, including changing to a plant-based diet, living in a small house, taking public transportation, and being minimalism. These solutions all help to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. I image if most people living on the Earth taking these actions, the climate crisis will be largely solved efficiently. The situation now seems uncontrollable because the global temperature is increasing almost two degrees, but I believe the condition will turn better. As we take the actions now following the path, combined with the future thoughts and technologies, our Earth will be saved. We don't know about what will happen in the future, so all conditions may occur.

I write this in the year 2060. Many changes have been made and our Earth is far from the planet it was in 2020. It has been a tumultuous 40 years, and very little remains the same from our past. The change of our planet isn’t a positive or negative, although it is fiercely debated in today’s society. To travel back in time, the fear of the climate crisis was steadily growing in 2020. It seems ridiculous now, but the fight for the livelihood of our planet became intertwined in politics, and the wealthy fossil fuel industry pitted American citizens against each other through the different democratic parties, the Democrats and the Republicans. Both sides argued amongst each other, and little progress was made in the years following 2020, with the Green New Deal not getting passes and a Republican (pro fossil fuel) President being re-elected. However, while it seemed like all was lost, change was just around the corner. Unfortunately, this change was unable to occur before terrible effects of climate change struck in various parts of the world. Covid-19, a flu-like virus, spread globally, causing a pandemic that killed 0.25% of the population. A vaccine was formed, but Covid-19 was here to stay and now each year accompanies the flu in typical “flu season”, causing death rates to spike in young children and the elderly. Additionally, sea level rise began to truly affect the human species, causing total submersion of the Maldives and many Indonesian Islands, resulting in many deaths and the displacement of the populations of literal countries. In America, ⅔ of Florida was submerged, and a trillion dollars worth of real estate and buildings was lost all over both the East and West Coast. Even more seriously, heat surges began to increase in frequency and severity, famously killing the homeless population of Tucson, Arizona as well as severely crippling countries such as India and several African countries. Around this time, there was an increase of belief of climate change, and the support of environmentally-conscious leaders became popular, and a member of the Green Party was elected in 2028. However, conditions got worse before they got better. In 2035, the “worst” year of climate change struck, with a record amount of deaths due to climate change-related issues. After this year, it was an almost unanimous decision that change must occur, and all developed countries made the change to completely renewable energy sources, with select countries in Europe achieving carbon neutrality. Additionally, the effectiveness of renewables had steadily increased over years, so the change was not as drastic as imagined in 2020. With these changes, we were able to prevent any more increases in global temperature, but it had been too late and many species had become extinct. Additionally, society slowly became more environmentally conscious and less materialistic, although this was most likely due to regulations on individuals carbon footprint, as people were allotted only 2 metric tons of carbon emissions a year. Now, in year 2060, the planet feels healthy, and just 5 years earlier, the Great Barrier Reef was found to be returning, and slowly growing. Life day to day is very different. People just seem nicer, less consumed by their jobs, and wealth is no longer measured in income and the size of your house, or the car you drive. Green change made other positive changes in many aspects of life indirectly. The Gross National Happiness has definitely increased, despite the lows we felt in the late 20s and 30s of the 21st century. While I felt pessimistic in 2020, I have never felt more optimistic for the future than now in 2060.

Dear future family,
                                  <br><br>

As you are reading this it is probably around the year 2060, but as I am writing this, I am sitting in my college dorm room in the year 2020. I am currently a first-year student at UCSB, and I am currently enrolled in a class known as “Climate Change 101”. This class emphasizes the vast changes our society needs to make to combat the increasingly growing problem of climate change. As of now, our country and world has failed to eliminate vast fossil fuel emissions which is causing our natural world to deteriorate before our eyes. The saddest part of this is that the United States is currently one of the leading emitters of fossil fuels on the globe. Our ridiculous consumerist lifestyles have accustomed us to buying unnecessary amounts of stuff and supporting industries such as fast fashion. 
                                  <br><br>

Although the generations before mine have fallen short of implementing solid solutions to mitigate this crisis, I am optimistic that my generation can bring the change we need. Individual action in favor of the climate is becoming increasingly popular and trendy in society. There has been an increasing acceptance in vegan and vegetarianism. People are even beginning to adopt lifestyles known as “freegan”, “flexitarian”, or simply just eating in favor of the environment. These changes may not seem to make that drastic of a change, but collectively they can make a big difference. At this point in time, we cannot wait for a large piece of legislation or fancy technology to come and save the day. Our current president has made it clear that this crisis is not a concern through backing out of the Paris Climate Agreement and shooting down the proposal of a Green New Deal. Therefore, we cannot rely on legislation to get the ball moving at this point. I am optimistic that there will be officials elected in the future that will support our efforts, but instead of waiting for that to happen we must be proactive in other ways.  We have to start with personal action, and I believe our generation can prompt that change. Many other movements have begun to surface as well. Tiny houses, slow travel, and eating fresh local produce has become a lot more prevalent in the last decade than ever before. 
                                  <br><br>

Along with personal action, our generation has effectively raised lots of awareness for this issue through collective action. A young climate activist known as Greta Thunberg has created one of the most popular climate platforms in the last few decades. She has successfully gained millions of supporters. Her protests and speeches have united our generation on this issue as well as proved that the young people of America will not put up with destroying our planet as the previous generations have. People like Greta reinforce the idea that our generation will be the one to prompt change that the future follows. 
                                  <br><br>

I personally have begun to implement personal changes into my life as well. Recently I have adopted a vegetarian diet which is much better for our environment than a carnivorous one. I have also begun to see the value in purchasing fair-trade and clean products within the beauty and fashion industry. Spending just a few dollars more on a product can ensure that the product was made under safe working conditions as well as with eco-friendly products. As you can see, I have not completely transformed my life. My life has pretty much stayed the same, and I have not noticed these changes having any negative effects.  However, our environment will feel the changes. If every person decided to make one change in their life with the environment in mind, we would make a monumental difference. 
                                  <br><br>

I hope that as you’re reading this letter you are appreciative and happy about the action my generation took. I hope that we successfully made an impact on the climate crisis and have not passed on a greater problem to you and your peers. I hope that you are able to grow up in an era unharmed by the environmental consequences of global warming. However, if my generation has failed to make any impact, I am sorry. I am sorry that our selfishness has poured this problem onto your generation. I am also sorry that I chose to bring you into a world full of environmental turmoil.
                                  <br><br>

With lots of love,
                                  <br><br>

Hi, this is your mother at 18 years old (19 in 10 days) on March 9, 2020 to share with you all that I hope our future looks like. 
                                  <br><br>

Today I’m in a class called climate crisis, where i'm learning about all the things impacting our climate currently and what we can do to help. This class is showing me what previous generations failed to do in order to protect our planet and how it is up to us to protect it. Although that is a lot to bare, I hope my generation succeeds with our goal to reduce emissions and secure your future. I hate to know we could ignore our 2050 deadline and ruin your future. However, I have hope. I believe my generation will get it together and curtail the negative track we're on in our Co2 emissions and waste. I promise you, today, I'm trying my hardest to do what I can to reduce my personal footprint. The important things I can be doing is educating myself, voting in favor of politicians concerned for our climate, reducing my meat consumption, flying less, and so much more. 
                                  <br><br>

I hope your future looks like this: you're a bright young child living in the city. You take public transport, run around town with your friends, have a beautiful wardrobe filled with unique thrifted pieces that we bought together one sunday afternoon. You grab your reusable cup as you run out the door because you like getting a coffee after school. You come home to a beautiful smelling kitchen of me or your father cooking a meal void of animal products and full of the best produce. On the weekends we make it a point to go on hikes as a family in order to not only remain fit but connect ourselves with nature. Hopefully in that time there are the same amount of  national parks (plus some) in America. You are adventurous so you run all over the place and climb the trees around us as we make our way up the trails. I hope I see you happy and healthy. You have the right diet, you respect our planet and your surroundings, and you value everything you have. You know happiness comes within and you don’t require the next big thing to fill any hole in your life. I look at your future and I see you yearning to learn more about culture and the outdoors than materialism and vain.
                                  <br><br>

For you, I hope I’ve educated you enough on how valuable protecting our planet is and that you take my advice and run with it so you can, as well, create a safe future for your own family. I hope you engage in your own sort of activism and by this time we have gained a lot of momentum in the climate movement. In this case, I hope by this time big companies find alternatives to palm oil fields and return their farms back into beautiful rainforests again, have reduced our meat consumption, reduced our population growth, saved endangered animals, and so much more. I want you to experience the beauty of the world that I have. There is no reason you shouldn’t. 
                                  <br><br>

Dear 2060,                                  <br><br>

There is so much I want to tell you and so much I also want to apologize for on behalf of my generation and those before mine as well. I can only hope that you’re living in a world where things are actually going well, a world where all the animals I remember actually being able to pet and see for my own eyes in person still exist. I hope for you, that the beauty of the coral reefs are still around to purify the seas and be able to be seen by others. If this is not what it’s like for you guys then again I am well and truly sorry for what you are not able to behold due to my generation’s mistakes. All I can really do I suppose is to inform you that we tried our very best to save this planet...well I guess some of us tries our very best while those whose emissions and efforts truly mattered didn’t care at all about the destruction of our planet. 
                                  <br><br>

Unfortunately in my time that I’m writing from right now, there is a great struggle going on, a struggle that is looking quite positive as of now but can so very easily change for the worst. We have a man right now, by the name of Bernie Sanders running for president and giving the young generation hope that differences will be made. Differences that will come to fruition, and hopefully live on to the point where you guys will benefit from them. There is also the Green New Deal that we have going on right now, that if passed will start a cycle of only positive change for the climate and our surrounding global populations. As I’m writing this I’m hoping that all these things that I’m hoping for actually come to happen because if they don’t then I am genuinely terrified for what it meant for my future children who are right now starting their adulthood lives. 
                                  <br><br>

At the very least I want to tell you the story of me: a first generation Latina college student who since entering the class of Climate Crisis 101 has come to learn so much about what has been done to our planet and what continues to be done to it. Since the beginning of this class, I have started making changes in my own life that while may not seem that drastic in the bigger picture, are taking sacrifice to do and these sacrifices I will continue to make if it means that the people I’m writing to now are living on a healthier and more stable planet. This class was an emotional whirlwind for me but in the best way possible. I will admit that there were times where I was brought to tears watching some people lose homes and even relatives to natural disaster that when dissected weren’t actually all that natural. I cried watching what people around the world are suffering despite them not even being the leading cause of the greenhouse gas emissions that are a major contributing part of the climate change crisis. However, I have also smiled in this class when certain films have given me hope that we can change and reverse the crisis. I am writing this letter to you guys of 2060, to my future children, hoping that my generation did succeed and you guys have the beauty of the coral reefs still, the beauty of all of our current animal species, and the beauty of having a healthy planet once again.

From me to me: 
                                   <br><br>
If you’re reading this then congrats, you made it to your sixties alive! Obviously being 60 years old isn't old, but you used to joke all the time during your college years that you couldn't wait to be “there in life”, wherever “there” even was. Now look, you’re here and I bet you wish you were back in college having fun with your best friends doing who knows what (you know what actually hahaha)! Stop reminiscing now - you probably stopped reading this letter and started having flashbacks from the good old days. But hey, there are still good days to look forward to! I bet in college you wouldn't have thought you would have made it this far - what I mean by this is not being successful in life, no, you knew you were going to do great things no matter how many obstacles you were going to face. By making it this far I mean, our Earth made it through all the mess we put it through. As you might remember, or might not, considering you have selective memory and only remember what you want to remember, climate change was going to literally kill us all - but that's not the case considering our Earth is as beautiful as ever (who would've thought). 
                                  <br><br>
 We have made so much progressive change as a planet, I don't think many of us saw this coming, especially those who were very pessimistic of the climate crisis, BUT HEY, WE DID IT! Do you remember when all of this change started? Do you remember when you started to take individual action? You most likely don't because of your terrible memory haha but let me refresh it for you. You were 19 years old, it was your second year at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and you took an English 23 course called, “The Climate Crisis” during your winter quarter. Jesus Christ, winter quarter was pretty rough for you - you took a few classes that you didn't quite enjoy (poly sci 15 was one of them - man that coding class kicked your ass), but I remember you enjoying ENG 23 very much. You learned so much from that class and used your knowledge and acted upon it! Remember that one quote, “if acted on, knowledge is power. If not, knowledge is power squandered.” Man did you have serious epiphanies when you first heard the quote. You took that quote with you whenever you obtained new information, and even went out your way to educate others, no matter what it was that you were learning. 
                                  <br><br>
 But as I was saying, ENG 23 not only educated you on the climate crisis and what it was doing to our planet, but Ken, the professor, provided you guys with a multitude of steps that one can take in order to help mitigate the climate crisis. At first you took this class for a GE, but as time went on, you took the class very seriously (as one should) and even decided to take Ken’s advice and started to change for the better. You switched up your diet to a more climatarian diet (which says a lot considering you used to eat red meat EVERY SINGLE DAY and thought you couldn't live without it), you rode your bike everywhere, you hardly ever spent your money on useless stuff such as clothing that you did not need, you continued to educate all of your friends and family any time you learned new material on the crisis, and you participated in your first presidential election! Go you! All the little changes do matter. You used to say that all the time, and you were right, considering that our Earth is fine now. 
                                  <br><br>
 Now take everything in. Breathe in the fine air. Look at the birds flying through clouds in the sky. Look at the flowers and trees waving at you. Look at the people outside walking their dogs. Look at the beautiful families enjoying each other's company on this splendid sunny day. Remember when you would go on runs every single day and take everything in, you would always appreciate the beauty of nature. You’re doing the exact same thing right now - taking it all in. Isn't life just blissful? 


</p><hr>


<p>

I really agree with your opinion. From my point of view, I really appreciate to be optimistic about my future. However, during the period right now, people didn’t pay a serious attention to the climate crisis. The politicians didn’t pay much effort, too. People who has strong power in government and in business kind of ignore the problem and may even harm the earth by exploring. It is significant to act right now and to make some change to the environment. For most people, they don’t have enough power to change the problem. They can choose a way to vote so that the leader can take good control of this problem.

I didn't plan to have any children at this point when writing this message for the future. 
                                  <br><br>
But if here you are, reading this message, don't worry, you are likely not a mistake :D
                                  <br><br>

In 2020 I took the English 23 course at UCSB and truly started to learn about the causes of the climate changes and its delaying effects, the majority of the society still adapted an unhealthy consuming culture that was slowly killing this planet. For me, my instructor Ken's apologies for his generation still engraved in my heart. As much as his sincerity moved me, his regrets about not being able to do enough in his generations also scared me. I soon realized that, if any efforts were actually done from his generations could help to ease our task at that time, then our task was merely to keep ourselves survive. The delaying effects in climate change marked a dire future that was corresponding to the relative small signs we have today, by relatively small I meant wildfire, flooding, drought, and extreme weathers. Hundred of thousands of people died or lost their homes, these natural signs warning us were nowhere close to "small". Interestingly that year coronavirus, a highly contagious disease with an incubation period up to 14 days, was spreading. Even with delaying effects of about 14 days, the U.S. gov was still trying to downplay its severity at the beginning, and no effective countermeasures were taken fast enough. Sound silly and dangerous, isn’t it? But let me ask you what if it was a habit that we all have, but have a delaying effect of decades before finally came to the severe consequences? There was no time to wait around for the politics or the social norm to have a change of heart. When the threats have reached and started effecting their lives severely, which finally led them to a realization, all would be too late, we had to ACT at the moment, immediately. 
                                  <br><br>

And that was the moment when I decided that was where the turning point of my life would be. I have decided to start small, I tried to adopt a minimalist lifestyle, and went on a fully vegan diet immediately, sold my car, started to avoid traveling by plane. I was an international student and did not have any political power (At least in US), and did not feel too comfortable in participating in activist activities yet, partially because of the virus spreading at that time. I wanted to start as an individual so I could learn how living environmental friendly would be like. Then I could teach my family and friends once I got the hang of it. And as for the future, I didn’t feel very optimistic, but how was I able to describe some unimaginable horror, or predict something too complicated to fit in any mathematical model accurately. But of course, there are always hopes, I just didn’t want to emphasize it too much so it desensitizes me from focusing on doing my part. Hopefully, my actions would have effects on others around me, ultimately we would build a society that is more sustainable.
                                  <br><br>

Thus if I would have had children in the future, that would mean things were going well as time went by. If that would be the case in 2060, I wish I would be able to announce to you proudly that I feel glad I didn’t ruin this beautiful planet that is for your generation. 
                                  <br><br>

I may or may not be there when the time comes to 2060, but do know that I always love you.

<p>
Dear Future Generations,                                  <br><br>

By the time that you are reading this in 2060, I hope that things have changed. The good news is that if you’re reading this, then that means my generation succeeded in saving the planet, or at the very least slowing down the Climate Crisis. When I am writing this letter, there is a lot of uncertainty around the future of the planet. The global temperature is rising at an alarming rate and over 415 Parts Per Million are being released into the atmosphere.
                                  <br><br>
 However, all hope is not lost as AOC and the Democrats are attempting to push the Green New Deal, a revolutionary piece of legislation that puts policies in place that will help transition our country towards a better future. This letter is largely filled with my hopes for the future of the planet. Things that I now know need to change and that I hope to have changed by your generation. The best way to demonstrate this is by going through the major components of the Green New Deal. Most of all, I hope that you can see how these changes have been implemented in your own lives.
                                  <br><br>
Right now, we rely heavily on the use of fossil fuels. They power our cars, our homes, and our technology. My hope is that in the future we have succeeded in switching to a cleaner energy source. Maybe we switch to solar or wind turbines? Regardless, the fossil fuel industry not only creates a large number of carbon emissions but also causes environmental damage through the processes that extract them from the Earth. By finding alternative energy sources, the planet was hopefully able to recover from the damage that my generation has caused.
                                  <br><br>
As I mentioned above, right now my generation loves our cars. We love to travel and explore this enormous planet that we live on. The problem is that this freedom comes at a cost, as each of the cars emits around 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year. To put this in perspective, each person is only supposed to emit 2 metric tons of CO2 per year. Manufacturing these vehicles causes even more CO2 to be emitted into the atmosphere. In the future, hopefully, we have moved away from these environmentally disastrous practices. Maybe we switched to implementing public transportation across the country, maybe our technology has advanced past the point of fossil fuels. Right now, efficient alternatives such as biking or taking trains or buses exist but are not implemented or given the funded needed to be effectively used by the population. Regardless, hopefully in the future we switched to electric vehicles or at the very least have cut down on our car usage. 
                                  <br><br>
Another major component of the Green New Deal is to build new things to power the world. As I mentioned above with public transportation, for many of these changes needed to save the planet, we just need the funds and support of the government to implement them. Honestly, there is a neverending list of the things that can be implemented to save our planet. Maybe you have solar panels on every building, public transportation implemented from coast to coast, or even enormous wind turbines that power our cities. However, even the smallest changes make a big difference on our planet. Maybe the bike lane has finally been shifted to behind the parked cars or buses have become mainstream again. The possibilities are endless for things that could be created to improve our world.
                                  <br><br>
With all of these changes, many people likely lost their jobs. But hopefully, these new changes created new ones. Instead of hiring technicians to mine our coal or harvest our natural resources, hopefully, we hired technicians to maintain our new sources of power such as solar panels or wind turbines. Right now, we need more jobs that add sources of energy to the planet rather than take them away from the planet. The fracking and mining industries are a major part of the current economy, they provide many jobs and financially support many politicians. However, they are also causing large amounts of carbon to be emitted into our atmosphere. They are taking things from the planet rather than helping the planet. What I mean by this is that we shouldn’t hurt the planet to save ourselves. By implementing these new jobs, hopefully, society was able to continue to thrive while the planet recovered. 
                                  <br><br>
A major part of the Green New Deal is in the importance of moving away from Fossil Fuel sources as well as Natural Gases and Coals. It is too late for us to incrementally move away from these sources of energy. We need a hard and fast stop on the use of these energy sources. There needs to be zero usage of these sources. It isn’t just about the carbon that is emitted from using these sources, but also the carbon that is emitted from harvesting them from the planet. I hope that by your generation, this is no longer a problem for you. That in the decade of 2020, the government switched to more eco-friendly energy sources. I hope that in your time, these fossil fuels are in the past. That our country doesn’t rely on them or on the industry’s money. 
                                  <br><br>
Right now, we know that decarbonizing means that many people will lose their source of income but the Green New Deal is created with the goal of protecting the American people. We aren’t just trying to save the planet but also rebuild the economy to improve society. In my time, society is very self-centered they focus on what will help their economic industries and their own well-being. Hopefully, this has changed by your time. The transition was likely rocky and met with considerable protest, but I hope that by your generation everyone sees why it is necessary. 
                                  <br><br>
I hope that by reading this, you are disturbed by the environmental consequences of the practices of the past and wonder how it ever could have gotten this bad. Honestly, after taking Ken’s class I find myself wondering the same thing sometimes. I hope that you see the problems with my way of life and the solutions that your generation implemented.

 Right now in 2020, momentum for responding to the climate crisis seems to be picking up. Especially in my generation, there are many people that are passionate about saving the earth. There are still many large obstacles (mostly in the form of large corporations) but it seems like we can turn the tide towards responsibility for our emissions. I have not yet made many radical changes in my lifestyle to do my part but many of the ideas I learned in Climate Crisis 101 are staying with me. Combined with the knowledge that quality plant protein can be even better than meat protein, I have began to increase the amount of plants I eat and have forgone meat as my go-to food. I have not yet become very active but I will continue to strive to be more responsible for my part in fighting climate change.

Dear Future Me:                                  <br><br>

The date is March 9, 2020. The democratic primaries have just passed and let me tell you, the campus was buzzing. “Hi, do you know where your voting location is?”, “UCSB FOR BERNIE”, “Have you voted yet? If not, here are some helpful tips and a flyer” etcetera. While I can’t speak for everyone, I can say that I feel a sense of urgency from the general public. I can feel the desperation in the air just to get Trump out of office and to vote for someone that is at least neutral and not a climate denier. Alongside that, COLA strikes are up and going; the wildcat strike is now almost UC wide. Graduate students are fighting for a cost of living adjustment and undergraduates as well as faculty are striking in solidarity…. As they should. Graduate students are being exploited for the work they do so they have completely stopped holding sections, submitting grades, and coming to class. Unfortunately, over 80 TAs were fired but that only fueled the fire and created a new community amongst the campus. 

                                  <br><br>

Another current event and hot topic is the CoronaVirus; I will start by saying that I am extremely irritated that this is getting more attention than the climate crisis just because it is a virus. The people who are most affected are those who are older because they are immunocompromised as well as health care professionals in the hubs of the pandemic. However, if most would just think about it, if we don’t address the climate crisis, it will look a lot worse than Covid-19. This coronavirus pandemic is displaying how capitalism, as a site of ongoing crisis, positions poor people and those living in precarious circumstances in close proximity to illness/death. Those working under exploitative conditions cannot simply “self-isolate” indefinitely.
                                  <br><br>
Update as of March 10, 2020                                  <br><br>

I just received an email from Chancellor Yang that the remaining of the quarter including finals will be held online. This will continue through the end of April. 

                                  <br><br>

It was only two years ago where I really got a grasp on the climate crisis and its dangerous consequences. It first began in my Environmental Politics course when I laid my eyes on the Green New Deal. Then, in my Medical Anthropology class as well as my sociology class, I learned about climate refugees. Even in my genetics and biology classes, climate change was a hot topic. I personally wish I would have learned it earlier. This information wasn’t taught at my high school let alone my middle school and elementary school. Yet, this has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the industrial revolution. . 
                                  <br><br>


While I may have learned tidbits about climate change in various classes, not only my views on the climate crisis as well as my actions have beneficially changed since taking ENGL 23. 3 years ago, I really started feeling this sense of urgency about the climate crisis and honestly, I attribute that to my college experiences. Though I became a vegan in highschool, college was when I became an ethical vegan. However, since ENGL 23, I have achieved some other goals.
                                  <br><br>
-Walking and biking as much as possible
                                  <br><br>
-Getting rid of single use plastics and always bringing my own tupperware, silverware, and reusable water bottle
                                  <br><br>
-Voting (especially in my first primaries)
                                  <br><br>
-Communicating with the so-called Uncle Pete’s of my family (Those who aren’t really on board with the climate crisis) by sending them articles and videos
                                  <br><br>
-Using my platforms by spreading the word about the climate change
                                  <br><br>
-Urging people to vote, and especially against fracking and the beef industry
                                  <br><br>
-Consciously buying items, whether it be from a thrift store, used, etc. and reminding myself that I don’t need a lot to be happy. So far, living like this has rubbed off on my friends and family.


All I have known growing up was that everything can be disposable/replaceable. To those who had eco conscious parents, I envy. At the same time, I don’t completely blame my family and parents because not only was that how they were raised, they were also victims of mass consumerism; ads were purposely targeting people to buy, buy, buy. Unlike how I was raised, I dream of a different future. A future where the government puts the peoples’ happiness first. A future where the people have medicare for all and education for all. Minimalism would be the normal way of living and people living life that has a meaning. Transportation around cities and towns that have kick ass public transportation such as bike baths, buses, and trains instead of cars. I would love it if we got rid of the fracking industry as well as the mega beef industries. Also, let’s address the president situation, I would like a president that believes in climate change, who unites the people, focuses on injustices, and who isn’t just plain stupid. In terms of my own living situations and personal preferences, I want a small house (like the relatively tiny houses that have multipurpose niches). The roof would be topped with PV solar panels and my yard would have a variety of fruit trees along with a garden to grow most of my food. I am just hoping the future is better than now. I want people to unite to make this world a safer place.

A letter to my future self:                                  <br><br>

After learning about the climate crisis your freshman year of college, I hope you recognized that your actions not only personally, but collectively made an impact on the world. I hope you realized that you needed to change your lifestyle and not wait for others to action in order for you to decide that enough was enough. After all that has happened, from the fire near campus first quarter to the wildfires in Australia, what more would you need to understand the gravity of the climate crisis? You made personal changes by not only becoming a flexitarian, becoming more conscious about your food waste, and buying less, but you also took collective and political action by voting in the 2020 presidential primaries and election and convincing your friends to participate in “meatless Mondays.” But was that enough? What about the others who knew exactly what was going on and sat on the sidelines and watched the world deteriorate? Although your younger generation was able to grasp the gravity of the climate crisis and the doom that the future generations would face, not enough was done to make change in the government. The older generations who had the power ignored the problem only when it was too late, decided that something needed to be done. Hopefully at this point, both the government and the public decided that it was finally time to take action! Fossil fuel companies were shut down and the burning of fossil fuels was banned, and the government made big changes to try to save the planet. People became more knowledgeable on the topic of the climate crisis and decided to reduce their own personal emissions by reducing their waste, prioritizing slow transportation methods, buying less, and maybe even moving into micro-apartments or co-housing in cities. At this point, slow travel methods would become more efficient and there would no longer be a need to use planes to travel across the continent and bike infrastructure would be improved for the new influx of people who biked to school and work. Meanwhile, the Green New Deal had finally been implemented and people were starting to see a change in the US. Now that it is 2060, around 40 years after I am writing this, there may be not only increased temperatures but also a loss of some species of animals and land masses. Despite these consequences, you can find comfort in knowing that at least action was taken sooner than later. If everyone kept ignoring the climate crisis, there could be worse, like heat deaths, famine and climate plagues. The continuation of effective communication of the climate crisis and drastic changes to policies in the government will lead to a better future.

I loved your letter to your future self! I like how you stated all the things you're trying to do better, but still hold yourself accountable by asking yourself if it was enough. One of the many things I learned from this class is that no mattter what we think we're doing or how well we're doing, we always need to hold ourselves accountable by continuing to learn ways that we can help the climate crisis. I really felt like I was reading an actual letter from the future because you mentioned so many good points. One being that yes, our generation was able to grasp the gravity of this situation perhaps better than any other generation, but like you said, we could not make a big enough change in the government. This is something my letter included too as I feel like it is an actual possibility.

I am writing this letter to accompany the time capsule which will be buried here, deep below the bluff overlooking Campus Point at UCSB. The date is Saturday, March 14, 2020. The capsule is intended to be buried deep below the surface of the bluff as it uncertain how much of it will be left by the year of its intended recovery, 2060. I am burying this capsule with photos of the 2020 UCSB campus so that the future generation of students can have a glimpse of all of the things which will likely be lost in the coming years due to the current inaction in regards to the climate crisis. 
                                  <br><br>


To start, I have placed images of the bluff trail and the lagoon. It is highly plausible that due to sea level rise, the bluff trail where this capsule is buried will erode away from the edge of the cliff and eventually the lagoon will fuse with the ocean, the shoreline extending closer to campus. For future students reading this who may not know any of these locations, the bluff trail is a stunningly beautiful walk with all kinds of flora and fauna. The edge of the cliff is teeming with ice plant, its roots working in and out of the densely packed sand. There are all kinds of trees which tower above the trail, providing a place to climb and escape the bright sun. Students  stroll out with a group of friends to watch the sunset go down under the horizon. The lagoon is just inshore of the bluff trail and wraps around the lower part of campus, teeming with wildlife, with countless types of birds and many salt marsh species. 
                                  <br><br>


The next image I have included is of the stunning horizon that can be seen from campus. There will still be a horizon in 2060, however it is unclear if what currently exists there still will. Across the ocean resides the Channel Islands, with Santa Cruz Island front and center, proudly sitting atop the horizon. Even as the shoreline shifts, rocks come and go, Mother Santa Cruz is always there, calm and constant in an ever changing ocean. Some days are foggy, rainy, and cold, and Santa Cruz will dip behind the gloom. Yet, we always know she is there and will soon return to us on a brighter day. 

                                  <br><br>

Moving from campus into Isla Vista, I am going to include the final image in the time capsule as Del Playa, the closest street to the ocean and a cultural hub at UCSB. It is home to many of the students at UCSB, also housing a large majority of social gatherings. During the daytime, one would likely see students walking, biking, and skateboarding up and down DP. Houses are littered with bikes, surfboards, wetsuits, bathing suits, and happy people. There may be a few stray beer cans from the night before as well… As day turns into night, people fill the street to have a fun night with friends, dancing at a party, at a concert, and in the street. Due to the fact that much of the bluff is already eroded in 2020, it is highly likely that the entire street of Del Playa will not exist in the year 2060.
                                  <br><br>


I am burying this time capsule for the future students who may not get to experience these various parts of UCSB that make it what it is today. However, I have hope. I have hope that one day this time capsule will be opened by a future generation who walks out to the bluff together to watch the sunset, rather than being found on a far off shore. I have hope that they will open it and chuckle to themselves as they see photos of the bluff trail, the lagoon, Santa Cruz Island, and Del Playa, all things that still exist. I have hope that they will feel gratitude that their grandparent’s generation took action and mitigated the climate crisis.

In 2020, you became much better informed regarding both the climate change issues that plagued humanity and the solutions to these problems by taking Ken's ENG 23 course. Even with the Coronavirus spreading across the world, causing mass hysteria and paranoia as finals get cancelled and classes move online, completely changing how you went about your daily life, you still took action to save the planet right then and there; not in 2021, not in 2022, in the year 2020. You minimized food waste by refusing to buy more than you absolutely needed at the grocery store, preventing massive quantities of food from contributing to greenhouse gas emissions as they rotted in landfills. You chose to abstain from red meat and dairy as much as possible, greatly reducing your support of the release of potent methane into our atmosphere. You adopted a more minimalist mindset, giving away possessions you didn't really need or value and purchasing fewer items in general, shrinking your more costly, consumerist lifestyle and instead opting to appreciate the things you have now that allow you to live better and grow as an individual. For the very first time, you voted in the 2020 presidential primaries and the presidential election, and also managed to convince 4 of your housemates to join you in abiding by their civic duty as American citizens; all of us supported politicians and propositions that placed a large emphasis on climate change and enacting real changes in American society. Despite not knowing before, you continued to adhere to only flying when necessary, perhaps once every 3 to 4 years for say, your study abroad program. You never bought a car, since even electric vehicles can contribute to emissions, instead choosing to bike and take public transportation whenever possible; at your worst, you carpooled with your friends when using a car as a mode of transportation proved the more sensible option. You continued to live with housemates in a reasonably sized apartment. You practised safe sex by always using a condom, preventing an accidental birth that would have tremendously impacted your life at the time. All of these things, they all truly integrated into your life, all because of ENG 23.

By now, America as a whole stands in stark contrast to where it was 40 years ago. We have completely transitioned to renewable energy to power the entire nation, creating thousands of jobs by building solar farms, wind farms, and safer, more efficient nuclear power plants in the event both solar and wind weren't sufficient; your own home sports a roof covered in solar panels, a large backup generator and battery storing energy in case of unfortunate weather. Cars no longer dominate transportation, phased out in favor of high-speed railways that connect every state to each other, allowing for fast, affordable travel no matter where you live in America now, in addition to having a sophisticated public transit system consisting of buses and the like. For short distances, many can be seen riding a bike, electric or not, on dedicated bike paths that lead straight to many businesses, shops, and public spaces like parks. Many Americans haven't seen red meat on their plates in decades, considering the vast gastronomic advances in vegan alternatives that can't be distinguished from the real thing, despite originating from labs across the country; the average American diet looks much healthier and varied now. Accidental pregnancy rates are so astronomically low you forgot they even occur, thanks to widespread contraception available for free for anyone who needs it, not to mention a comprehensive, practical sex-ed curriculum now taught in every high school in the country. People don't really own that many things anymore. All of a sudden, that new iPhone doesn't seem that appealing to most people; they've been perfectly content with their phones for years now, replacing parts when needed rather than buying a completely new device. Instead, people choose to focus more on bettering themselves now, finding fulfillment in maintaining their mental, emotional, and physical health and supporting each other in their endeavors; this manifests in the form of exercising regularly, having open conversations with each other, and practicing mindfulness in their everyday lives, just to name a few. We've come so far, it's hard to think that you were worrying about the world your kid will get to see; they have it better than I did when I was the same age, and I'm eternally grateful for that, satisfied with how things turned out for the better. I couldn't have imagined us reaching this point, but we really stepped up to the plate and we acted before it was too late. Before everything spiraled out of our control. Congrats humanity.

 I first want to start off by saying that I hope everything in the future, hopefully around the year 2060, is going well for you. It is currently the year 2020 and I’m in my second quarter here at UCSB as a first year. I’m currently doing an assignment for my English course called “Climate Crisis 101”, which I absolutely adore. I can honestly say that I’ve enjoyed this class a lot and also learned so much, and this is taking into account that I primarily enjoy stem classes. It really takes me out of that environment, and puts me in a more humanities environment which is nice, because in this course, I get to talk about what I think and feel about our current situation, and I must say, it’s quite liberating. I hope that you have expanded your knowledge on the topic of our climate way beyond my current understanding today. 
                                  <br><br>

 As of today, climate change is one of the biggest threats to our world and the living organisms that inhabit it. Hopefully, in the future, that isn’t the case. In our English class we talk about solutions that would help stop the climate crisis, one of them being political action such as voting, which I find most important as of now. Right now, most people in our class, including myself, have already voted and want Bernie Sanders (RIP) to win the presidential election, he can implement the green new deal, which will hopefully bring climate change to a halt. As of the time of this message, unfortunately, Bernie is currently in second in the democratic primaries to Joe Biden. Even if Bernie Sanders isn’t elected for president, that shouldn’t mean that we lose faith in humanity. I know that we, as a species, have the ability to come together and find another way to stop this mess we have created. It can’t be all up to someone running for president, it’s up to all of us. 
                                  <br><br>

Though political action is just one of the many ways that we can take to stop the climate crisis, there’s other ways, such as individual actions and changes that we can implement into our daily lives. Unfortunately, I’m not doing so hot right now with making these individual changes in my life, such as switching to a largely plant-based diet. I hope that in the future I have already implemented a plethora of ways to reduce my climate footprint into my life, because right now it’s not looking so good. I always talk the talk, but never walk the walk when it comes to climate change. In other words, I know what I have to do to help stop climate change, but I’m not doing it. I wish I could make simple changes in my life, like switching to a largely plant-based diet, but if you remember me well enough from 40 years ago, you know that I love meat and I can’t get enough of it. I hope that as you’re reading this message that you’re thinking to yourself, “Wow, was I really this selfish?”, as you’re eating your plant-based meal for breakfast. I wish I could make such changes now, but in essence, it ties back to me being lazy. I say I care about the environment, yet I’m now willing to make the changes that would prove that. I hope that soon in the future that I’ll have a grand realization about the climate crisis, which would in turn lead me to immediately change the way I currently live my life for the betterment of our planet. 
                                  <br><br>

I hope that I have a beautiful, loving family which you have educated to about the importance of our climate and how our actions can negatively affect it. I believe that although we will obtain greater technological advancements in the future, I feel like they won’t be enough to stop climate change all on its own, and once most people realize that, they realize something else, and the something else is that it’s up to us, as the human species to communicate and work together to stop the climate crisis. 
                                  <br><br>

I’m feeling really optimistic about the future and can’t wait to see what wonderful things it’ll have in store. I really hope that I can start making changes to my lifestyle for the sake of the planet. As of right now, that doesn’t seem like the case. I feel like I’ll soon come to the realization of the impact that my actions have on the planet and then begin my transformation from there, but as of now it’s all talk and no walk. So I hope that, as you’re reading this message, Daniel, that you are walking the walk (i.e, letting your actions speak for themselves), which I’m sure you are. I hope this message finds you safely, and wish nothing but the best for you and the future of our planet and all those that inhabit it.

To whoever is reading this letter:                                  <br><br>

Hi, this is a letter from 2060. We have successfully resolved the questions about the climate crisis. Even though the cost is high. Because of global warming,  many viruses beneath the North and South pole was released. Thousands of people had died. Governments finally began to take action regarding it. Although it was a little bit late, it is still not too late. After 20 years, we finally solved the problem by registration the emission of CO2 and methane.  For anyone reading it, I hope you can understand the question about the climate is severe and urgent. If you are reading it, please begin to act in order to protect our earth and save the planet. Please eat less meat, especially beef, since it can produce tons of methane which is harmful to the planet. Hopefully, you can become a freegan or eat a plant-based diet. Even though it seems unreasonable and ridiculous, it can help the climate a lot. Besides methane, CO2 is a large proportion of harmful gas to the climate. I believe you know driving a car can emit lots of CO2. You may think in the future we developed cars that don't need gas. However, the factory can also produce lots of CO2 when producing an electric car. The most effective way for reducing the emission is not buying a car. In addition to cars, planes are also producing CO2 into the atmosphere. Even though planes are considered as public transportation, and we are taught public transportation is not that bad for the environment compared to cars. However, because the amount is too large, it still counts for a large amount of pollution for each individual. By telling you these, I hope you can understand how severe the question is, and hopefully, you can act right now. There are lots of articles talking about the climate crisis and feasible actions. By reading them and act as they say, you are saving the planet, yourself, and your children.

To my future self:                                   <br><br>

As of 2020, there is undeniable evidence of a climate crisis, it’s just a matter of what we do NOW that will determine how climate change will direct the course of human history. In a couple months, we will have a presidential election, and it’s scary to me how much the outcome will matter. Apart from voting, our actions are going to fall somewhere in the range of “we did absolutely nothing”, in which case we will pay the price for it, or “we did absolutely everything”, in which case we hopefully only have to deal with a limited number of consequences. I don’t mean to be pessimistic, but I don’t think we will be on the end of the “everything” spectrum. I have full faith we will be at the very least somewhere in the middle, which will hopefully buy us some time to look for more solutions. A huge reason why I feel this way is because of the sweeping cultural change that would have to be achieved in order to do “everything” needed, and that cultural change would be difficult to initiate. People would need to switch to a largely plant based diet, stop flying, adopt/have fewer kids, not drive, etc., and quite frankly, the vast majority of people, including myself, would find it extremely difficult to do all of those things. The only way that we would is if we were forced to in some way, which frankly seems to distopian to be realistic. 
                                  <br><br>
However, I do believe that we will be able to make significant change as long as the right people are voted into office. For example, environmentally friendly transportation requires infrastructure, which we can’t do much about individually. On the other hand, there are so, so many things we can do on our own, for example, flying less, eating as a climatarian, adopting kids, driving less, and buying less, as mentioned earlier. 
                                  <br><br>
I think most people could realistically do some or most of these things, but currently don’t because 1) they just don’t know about it 2) they are afraid of drastic change. We can change #1 by spreading awareness of not simply how horrible climate change, but the things that we as individuals can do about it. As far as #2, rather than telling people to stop driving and flying altogether, AND become a vegetarian AND not have their own kids, we can encourage them to ease into it. I completely agree that, assuming everybody did it, this would be very effective at mitigating climate change. But it’s not fair to ask anyone to do all these things on this level. As Ken has mentioned in lecture, it is much better for the majority to make some change to their diet, rather than a tiny fraction to be completely vegan. However, I do not think that it’s unreasonable to encourage them to take fewer short vacations or use alternative forms of transportations, eat as a climatarian, or have 2 or less kids. This does not sound nearly as scary and would likely be met with less resistance. 
                                  <br><br>
I truly hope that, looking back at this, I can say, “we did it”. I don’t want to our generation to be the one my kids look at and think “why couldn’t they do it when there was still time”. I don’t want my kids to grow up on a planet that is suffering, or to have to question if they/their kids/their grandkids will even survive. I really, really hope that we can pull it off. And to the 2060 version of myself reading this - I really hope we did.

We all thought 2020 was going to be a great year. You had so many plans for yourself. Eat better. Buy less clothes. I remember how you felt really depressed sometimes because you felt like you weren’t doing enough for the environment, despite what you have learnt. Where you came from, you couldn’t vote. You loved a good meatball sandwich. And the clothes, you couldn’t stop buying them, looking at them, admiring them because somehow you couldn’t get it out of your head that clothes somehow ties into your self-worth and the way you view yourself.
                                  <br><br>

Not only until the corona virus hit and school was closed down and you had to scramble all your belongings while also trying to decide between staying with your boyfriend or fly back to your family that it occurred to you, “Do I need two suitcases of clothing?” The answer was quite obvious, wasn’t it? It’s kinda sad that only during these shitty times that people stop and think about what truly matters. You were absolutely overwhelmed and terrified, because you didn’t want to throw all of that stuff away, because you spent so much money on them, but just looking at them then made you want to throw up.
                                  <br><br>

It’s 2060, and guess what, after much needed therapy and active soul-searching and self-flection, you’ll have managed to curb your appetite for things. And I’d like to think that it made you happier. You’ve decided to learn how to cook delicious vegan recipes and you love eating them very much and no longer crave pork chops. I’m so proud of how far you’ve come. I don’t know that it did anything to help though.
                                  <br><br>
Remember that musical you were in junior year of high school? Urinetown? Malthusian crisis, water runs out, can’t afford to pee? Well it’s kinda like that, but with paper. The government has decided that there’s not enough oxygen in the atmosphere and we can no longer afford to cut down trees. The printing houses and publishers went out of business; jobs were lost in the process. People now carry around a piece of cloth to wipe their asses whenever they go to the bathroom, then clean the cloth later with this chemical sanitizer. I know, iffy, but humans adapt.
                                  <br><br>

On the other hands, lands for other species have been drastically reduced; humans and their livestock comprise 95% of the earth’s biomass. The population has reached unfathomable numbers. Countless people are either homeless, sleeping on the streets, or packed into these housing units like sardines. You’ve saved up and gotten yourself a bedroom size apartment; it’s so small, but you manage.
                                  <br><br>

I know this doesn’t sound desirable at all, but let me tell you, people get used to things you know, and so do you. Perhaps when you’ve started making the changes, it’s already been too late, but at least you made it. It makes you a little happier and life a little more worthy of living, and that’s all that matters. You spend lots of time reading, playing guitar, singing, sewing, painting, and helping others. Everything might be going to shit, but at least that taught you to live everyday as it is, with no expectations, and just do your best.

Dear UABC board members,
                                  <br><br>

The year is 2060. 40 years ago, in 2020, was when the world ended (sort of). That was the year most the world was infected with COVID-19. However, this was just the spark that caused the collapse. Due to the economic uncertainty and political turmoil, more bad things happened. Some died from sickness, but more from hunger. Trade had stopped, millions went hungry. The US invaded Mexico. China took over part of eastern Russia, things weren't looking good.
                                  <br><br>

What ensued would later be called World War Three. It was a rather short war, it only lasted around an hour. No one knows who shot first, but the entire nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Russian Federation were unleashed upon the planet. Many people died, and the ensuing nuclear winter killed almost everyone. The population of the world was reduced to just a few hundred thousand people. For now, the warming of the planet was not a large issue. It was a frozen wasteland.
                                  <br><br>

I had managed to survive the bombs. Due to the economic downturn, I had been working in a coal mine as a summer job. For some reason, no one was hiring physics undergraduates in that economy. It was 6:39 PM, and I had forgotten my phone at the bottom of the mine. Everyone else had already left due to strict union laws that limited how late you could work, we had to leave at 6:30. I was on my boss's good side though, and he let me go back down by myself. While I was half a kilometer underground, the bombs hit. For ten years thereafter, I survived by living off the land.
                                  <br><br>

Using what I learned from reading the first two chapters of Walden Pond, I made a makeshift dwelling for myself. I survived off of termites and crickets, as well as mutated deer meat. My only friend was a three legged dog, who I named Shadow. My days consisted of fighting off raiders, and looting the homes of what was once Seattle. There were lots of raiders, people with nothing to lose, willing to do anything for some food scraps.
                                  <br><br>

After ten years, I had accumulated a fair amount of wealth. Gold bars, canned food, a greenhouse to grow crops. But, it was not enough, I wasn't happy. I needed a purpose in my life, beyond the mere accruing of more loot. I decided to help others, to help the world. I needed to unite the roaming gangs of raiders and squatters under one flag, and restore America to its once prosperous state. This vision was great, but it would not be an easy task, as these people hated each other. 
                                  <br><br>

Therefore, I did what any great leader would do, and found them a common enemy - North Korea. North Korea had largely remained unaffected from the rest of the world. Now that the other countries had collapsed, it began sending colonizing settlers across the oceans. They had established a settlement in what used to be San Francisco, and used this as their base of operations. They were heavily fortified, and after several skirmishes it became clear that it would be better not to mess with them.
                                  <br><br>

Nuclear winter had not let up, and it was still impossible to grow food outside. I decided that our common enemy would not be the North Koreans, it would be the cold itself, and who would know better about how to beat winter than me, someone who took English 23. Essentially, to save the world from nuclear winter, all we had to do was the opposite of what we were told to do in that class, and inject lots and lots of CO2 and methane into the atmosphere. Under this new cause the gangs united, and made me their leader.
                                  <br><br>

We began burning oil and coal just for fun. We burned plastic, tires, trees, anything we wanted for power. NASCAR made a resurgence, as well as flying in airplanes. We opened airline casinos, where the wealthy gambled as they flew from continent to continent. We made lots of money, carbon hedonism was all we had needed. After a few years the ice started to melt, but we needed to accelerate it. Using the frozen cells of cow fetuses, a bio-engineered cow was made to be 10X more flatulent than any cow had been previously. These cows were unleashed upon the world and their numbers grew exponentially. The more cows there were, the warmer the world would get. These cows were used to feed the coming generations brought up in the wake of nuclear war, and provided the embers that fueled a growing world economy. The lands that were once United States of America and Canada, had become the territory of the United American Burger Corporation, which spanned all of North America. I was elected by the UABC board to be the CEO.
                                  <br><br>

I have been with UABC for over 25 years now. As my days as CEO of the UABC draw to a close, I wanted to address the board members. The world is fine for now with global temperatures matching those of Earth in 2020, but in a few years, we will once again be in a climate crisis. In order to keep up our profit margins there will need to be some changes. This time, it will be too hot again, and if we want this company to stay afloat, we need to act now. Hopefully, you will be strong in those troubling times and make the right decisions.

This is you from 2020. At this time, there are still a lot of people who deny the existence of climate change. You, as a student who are taking a class about the climate crisis, are still struggling about how you can change more to protect the earth. In this class, you learned a lot about how climate change is damaging the earth and what factors cause climate change. Also, you learn what you can do in order to save the climate crisis. But you are still struggling. According to what has been taught in the class, You want to give up eating meat and having a eating habit better for the earth. However, although you want, you still do not start, because you like meat so much. You want to take public transportation, but you are still driving a car to school everyday. You want to take slow transportation rather than a plane, but you are still taking planes in order to save the time. I do not know at what time you will start to change. But I believe you will change someday right? You have learned a lot in class. You know what we are facing. You know what we will face in the future. Actually, I want to ask you. Do I change myself in the future? If I do, I want to ask, is the earth getting better now? Or do you see the big change about earth that was caused by your action? If you do not see, do not worry, you will see. If I do not change myself, well, I guess, the situation is much worse than now right. Because this is a tragedy, although for those who have taken education, like me, still do not change ourselves. I do not know what the future looks like. I just know if we do not make any change, the world will be destroyed by humans. If at your time, the world has conquered this problem, then I want to tell you, do not worry what you have experienced before. The planet needs protection. Do not hurt it again.

To my 18 year old self,

                                  <br><br>

The year is currently 2060, a whole 40 years after you took Climate Crisis 101. Lots of things have changed, some for the worse, but a lot for the better. The past 40 years have been hugely important for the human race, and I'm sure you're aware of this as you are studying the importance of Climate Change and the profound impacts it can have on our society. In the summer of 2020, numerous natural disaster shocked the world, enough to make climate change everyone's number 1 policy, and a bipartisan issue. In the presidential election of 2020, the Democrats won over the republican incubmant Donald Trump, and a whole new wave of Green Policy began to trickle into our legislation. No matter what party, green new deal legislation was beginning to take effect, and people realized the seriousness of the Climate Crisis. Millions of people started planting trees, eating largely plant based diets, and even switching to renewable forms of energy. Huge fossil fuel companies were destroyed by government restrictions on lobbying and subsidiaries, making the political and natural world much cleaner. It was like a veil had been lifted off of the public, and people began to think critically about the problems that everyone would have to face. Elon Musk actually created a renewable source of energy, able to be implemented in huge urban metropolis' to small, rural areas that hadn't even been developed yet. This was able to happen due to the governments of the world revisiting the Paris accords after the new democratic lead, and the United States began to take its lead in showing the world what a renewable future could look like. Developing third world countries followed our lead and were encouraged to do the same, completely skipping the steps needed for a traditional "industrial" society. Additionally, the US took note of countries like Denmark, where they were already 100% carbon neutral, and the happiest country in the world. Leaps in technology allowed transportation to become much more climate friendly. Bikes are now able to travel at roughly half the speed of a normal car, and all cars are fully electric. The US also implemented a whole new network of electric buses and trains, which are all available to the public and faster than ever. Airfare is a tough one as most of the planes have only partially been converted to renewable sources of energy, but the technology is rapidly evolving. Additionally, people were so scared about climate change that we actually began sending people to mars, and there is now a sustainable human environment on Mars, so I guess we are an inter-planetary species now. 
                                  <br><br>
In terms of food, people realized that meats were mostly bad for them, so agricultural scientists were able to genetically engineer sustainable vegetables that provide similar nutrients but able to be produced with only a fraction of the land and resources needed. This alleviated the damage on our oceans and water supplies, making drinkable water once again available to everyone on the planet. The additional evolution in water filtration has allowed the oceans to once again flourish, with coral reefs slowly regenerating as well.  
                                  <br><br>
All these changes might seem like something so radical that nothing would ever come close to them, but its the true human spirit that took your (our) generation by storm and demanded change that would save the planet. It was up to us (you) to try and do something before its too late, and everyone put aside their differences to make a change.

<p>
We’ve made a lot of changes in the world in the last 40 years. Because of the very politically involved youth who are motivated for sweeping systemic change, we were able to elect Bernia Sanders. From electing Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential election, where the Green New Deal was enacted, universal health care was implemented, higher public education became free and student debt was erased, we were able to make sweeping changes to not only the United States, but to the world. In works with many countries and communities around the globe, we were able to greatly reduce the negative human impact on our environment.
                                  <br><br>
Firstly, because of all these aforementioned policies implemented during President Sander’s two terms and carried on in President AOC’s terms , the average American’s stress level decreased significantly. As we saw in the film “Happy” and the readings and film about minimalism, people with less stressors on their lives can lead more involved, holistic lives and tend to have a significantly smaller carbon footprint. Because they didn’t have to overwork countless hours in order to afford the necessary medication their child needed to survive, to afford to pay rent alongside paying outstanding student debt, they were able to spend time developing themselves and creating healthier, happier habits and ways of life. 
                                  <br><br>
As a result of the Green New Deal, the fossil fuel industry was quickly put out of business, but not to worry, those put out of work were quickly put into well paying and much less environmentally detrimental jobs managing, facilitating, planning, and building new, efficient public transportation systems in many major cities in the US, negating the need for a car for almost every American family. Public transportation, similar to the subway system in NYC or the BART in the Bay, public high speed railways were finally implemented in Los Angeles, making the ever-famed LA traffic a thing of the past. 
                                  <br><br>
Alongside implementing public transportation in cities, we were also finally able to achieve making the bullet trains across the country that had been discussed for years. Now, instead of flying, Americans are able to travel by high-speed solar paneled trains to any major city across the country, majorly decreasing our cumulative carbon footprint as well as make a more pleasant and calm travel experience. Alongside that, trains hold way more patrons than planes do, so more people have been able to travel and for much less money. If that doesn’t appeal to you, no worries! Ken’s idea of slow travel was actually picked up by a large amount of american families- with their new, calmer, more environmentally friendly lifestyle, families have been traveling partially by bike on the newly constructed bike paths all around the country, then taken the bullet train when they decided to do so.
                                  <br><br>
The youth hasn’t only taken charge via voting, they also helped make fast fashion a thing of the past. With apps like Depop and Poshmark, resell sites and companies like Thredup, and the increasing appeal and interest in thrifting, fast fashion has diminished majorly. Thrifting has become the main source of clothing for most people, making fun, cheap, and unique affordable and environmentally friendly clothing the norm. Alongside that, people have seen more value in better made, more expensive items that will actually last, diminishing the need to shop as often as we once did.
                                  <br><br>
As a country, we’ve been able to decrease our average carbon emissions from around 20 metric  tonnes to 2 per person annually through these changes, very similar to as we saw with Peter Kalmus.
                                  <br><br>
But this hasn’t only happened in the USA, after rejoining the Paris Agreement, we were able to finally take action as a global community to make these goals mandatory, not just something they agreed to do without any sort of power to implement it. We worked together as a global community to bring accessible energy through geothermal, advanced solar, turbines, and wind power to developing countries, helping increase the standard of living and quality of life. It also created more jobs for these communities building and implementing these new forms of energy, helping stimulate the economy and get many workers out of the horrible garment industry and into more safe and better paying jobs.
                                  <br><br>
As well as making conscious changes to how we treat the planet going forward, we also,  as a global community, have made efforts to fix the harm we have done to the planet in the past. By enlisting the help and knowledge of Indigenous communities across the globe, we have worked to fix , regrow, and heal our natural environment. Many organizations have been formed to work on afforestation, creating community gardens, beach clean up, coral reef clean up and re-introduction of species that had been made smaller as a result of ocean acidification and increased ocean temperature. Many people have converted to plant-based diets, so animal agriculture has decreased to a point where most land that was animal ag is now protected areas for afforestation and national parks.
                                  <br><br>
We have worked together to adapt our entire way of living as a global community, which has not only helped heal our planet, but has increased the quality of life for every person around the world.

Life back in 2020 was such a different time in the world. We were going through political shifts, viruses, potential wars, etc.… Its crazy to think that a mere forty years ago, we were still figuring out the energy crisis and dealing with global warming. The World health organization along with the creation of the Green society which effectively made use of fossil fuels a worldwide regulated resource. Along with sweeping legislation being enacted around the 40’s regulated food and water use. There are some things looking back that were controversial. For instance, the universal two child policy brought out what can only be described as a movie like dystopian society hiding of children was commonplace and enforcement of this was relaxed. We all knew people who didn’t abide by this law. The biggest shift in my opinion is the abundance of group housing and public transportation. Surprisingly, transportation hasn’t seen much advancement in around a decade. The industrial consumer society of the early 2000s has been all but eradicated. People just aren’t buying as much stuff. Documentaries being made on the subject of climate change are now taught throughout school, so kids today are learning about becoming a less consumer-oriented society. The real progress came from the realization that the issue of climate change was bipartisan in nature. The amount of environmental legislation passed by president Posty was daunting to say the least. There have been a lot of changes when it comes to mental health and drug prescription in this country. Since the legalization of marijuana and abandonment of the over diagnosed illnesses being treated with opioids and other harmful drugs. Our portion size has gone down substantially and the portions of meat which we are able to sustainably raise have come at the cultural shift towards a more plant-based diet. A lot has changed in the last forty years and will continue to change as we run low on clean drinking water. Its insane to think back on what life was like back then, people now days wouldn’t believe the kind of things that happened to get us prom point A to point B.

<p>

It is now the year 2060. I look back to 2020 when I took a class about the climate crisis. I am happy that I took the class because I was able to realize the importance of our role in climate change. I am glad that I made personal lifestyle changes in order to lessen my carbon footprint and by a result my contribution in climate change. I made the dietary change to vegan because the meat industry is a really big contributor in climate change. I also lived in the city and used public transportation instead of owning a car. I lived in a small apartment that allowed for less public land to be used. And like me, many people made the transition into cities and started a more sustainable lifestyle. As a result, public transportation improved greatly because of the increase in fundings. The bicycle infrastructure was also improved on and many people simply bicycled instead of using a car. Politicians realized the legitimacy of climate change and also made lifestyle changes themselves. The Green New Deal went into effect and as the general public saw its leaders make changes, they themselves did too. Other countries began following the United State’s footprints and soon sustainable living became the norm. It is hard to now think of cars and big houses as markers for wealth. Instead, people realized what truly made them happy. It was not consumerism or wealth. Rather they focused more on community and people became more kind and less selfish. Communities are now strong and everyone has a sense of belonging.

It's your aunt, Chloe, writing to you as a college freshman, graduating class of 2023. You're in your crib right now with your Mom, unaware of the world past binkies and blankets. When you're the one reading this as a college freshman, things will be drastically different. To compare, the majority of my life has been undergoing what we are calling the climate crisis. Officially declared in 2016, but has been of deep concern long before that. Half of the Great Barrier Reef has died, thawing permafrost triggering landslides of all sorts, and so on. A lot has changed since then, and that’ll be evident when you read this and don’t recall these events. Things got worse before they got better, but true change started with my generation and continued on with yours.
                                  <br><br>
2020 was the year I began contributing to the collective change across the planet. I took a course at UCSB called English 23 aka Climate Crisis 101. There, I was introduced to an entirely new outlook of change. Extremely distinctive from the classes I’ve taken before, I actually got to learn about changes I could implement in my own life. Changes that went far beyond the short 10 weeks I took the class. Changes that were taught to my sister (your Mom), who taught you the same. For me, the changes consisted of taking on a plant-based diet, voting for political leaders who believe in tackling the climate crisis, using public transportation as my primary source of transportation, flying less, and buying everything with a need (and never from fast fashion). For you, this probably sounds like the norm, But Ava, back then we were out of control. We did things in belief that they had no consequences. We lived lifestyles of greed and selfishness. In return, our planet suffered. Until, we decided to change for the better and for the necessity of it.
                                  <br><br>
I am beyond grateful to have entered a community that has shown me so much, and taught me to care even more. And I am also so grateful that your generation has gladly taken up this attitude and carried it on with persistence. Without people who cared enough, you would be reading this letter and suffering the events I mentioned in far worse conditions. Fixing our mistakes would be irreversible and helpless. So, I again am so thankful that we took action by sharing our concern and also spreading the word to vote for the people who helped make these changes a reality.  I’ll see you soon.

Dear future self:

                                  <br><br>

This is me writing from 2020 as a freshman studying at UCSB. I felt grateful for the chance of studying abroad and the opportunity to take Eng 23 course, which focuses on climate crisis. How’s everything going on recently? Have you survived the sixth mass extinction caused by human action? Have you changed your diet to a vegetarian?

                                  <br><br>

2020 has been a great year so far, I have begun my college life in another country and I started to ponder upon how my lifestyle contributed to the global environment. I used to ride a bike to school during my days in high school and I enjoyed each ride where I could have a closer look at the nature. Nowadays I took a bus to school everyday which I thought saves much energy compared with driving a private car. From my Eng23 class, I learned about countries like Copenhagen, which was considered as City of Bikes, as biking contributed to 60% of transportation. I’m curious that whether people in 2060 have designer more environmentally-friendly means of vehicles. Have the visions of zero fossil fuels become reality? Is renewable energy developed all over the world, especially in those less developed regions?
                                  <br><br>


In this day and age, the uninhabitable Earth has suffered a lot, such as permafrost, climate plague, poisoned sea, etc. Scientists propose that by the year 2040, there be no arctic ice in ocean in summer and we could sail over the North Pole. Even though this seems can be a scenic spot, I hope this will never happen in reality, we couldn’t turn more land into ocean. For island residents, the sea level rising can be a great catastrophe. 

                                  <br><br>

Have you taken part in some political activism? Currently, voting has become a to-do-list for everyone on my campus who is eligible to vote. It’s so-called the most convenient and least time-consuming strategy we can do to contribute to the climate crisis. We have made policies like Green New Deal and made statements like Paris Agreement. I’m sure that new policies will continuously be made to mitigate this crisis. If that’s the case, I hope you could participate in promoting and publicizing it in your own country. Collective power is always greater beyond imagination.

                                  <br><br>

The notion of co-housing is one of my takeaways from the English 23 course. It’s now a residential mode in the happiest country around the world - Denmark. If you have the chance, I sincerely wish you could experience that. It not only enhances human connections between each other, but also saves energy. Isn’t that memory precious when you grow up one day and look back on the days you spent with your neighbors or communities? It also eliminates the problem of over-consumption and reduce unnecessary waste. To live simply is a key to gain happiness. By the way, I’m curious that do you feel happy now or become happier in 2060? Even though the world is becoming more and more materialistic, I hope you could stay simple and stay happy, as you have always dream to be.

                                  <br><br>

“You are the last best hope of Earth.” This is a quote I gained from the film <Before the Flood> and I consider it to be my favorite quote. If human species still exist and diversity at that time, I hope you could always remember your responsibility as a citizen, as well as a human being.

A message from the future；
                                  <br><br>

Hey, it’s you, from 2060. I know it’s been a long time since you first got to know about the climate issue 40 years ago. But, everything has changed now, in a good way. A single class can have so much impact on a person’s life. Pretty remarkable huh? In 2o20, you looked for a literature class to fulfill a GE requirement in college, and then you signed up for a class under the English department which was weirdly about climate change. You actually had heard about the global warming phenomenon for a quite long time. You believed that it was a human-caused issue, but you had little related knowledge so you were motivated to know more about it. 
                                  <br><br>

The class opened up your eyes. You were shocked, devastated, disappointed at the horrible things that humans had done to the lovely planet. As lies and denials continue, you were pessimistic, looking around and seeing that the fires were destroying people’s homes and getting closer and closer; the weather got weird; arrogant and selfish humans eating wild animals and spreading the virus around the world. The last two lectures were canceled, and the future is not looking bright. However, all those things made you ponder,  and ponder. The situation was serious, and you were thinking - I must act.
                                  <br><br>

Equipped by the knowledge you learned from the class, you started to become a climatarian. You eat with the climate in mind, carefully choosing less beef, less meat, and reducing no food. You continued to pay attention to this ongoing climate issue as you felt it was strongly personally-related to yourself. You tried to talk about it with your friends and families. They were surprised by those “new ideas,” but proud that you took the initiatives, and some of them even would like to know more. Gradually, you started to live an actual better life with the changes you’ve made for the environment. You wrote about your experiences on your blog on your personal website. Your actions influenced more and more people.
                                  <br><br>

Fortunately, the Democrats took over the white house in 2020. Everything seems to go worse at the beginning of that year; but wait, it will get better. They won’t let you down. As AOC and other congress members proposed, the Green New Deal was put into effect. The average Greenhouse gas emissions, for the first time in so many years, went down. Thousands of jobs were created for working on new energies, which are widely used now. The awareness to protect the plant went straight up, thanks to the young folks like you. You’ll be surprised to see how many people bike now. We’re living so much happier and healthier lives. Thank you. Keep going. I can’t wait for you to see the future.

Dear my future children,
                                  <br><br>

 I am writing to you in the year 2020.  We are at a critical point in the climate crisis as we have only a few years to stop burning fossil fuels before it will be too late to turn back.  As of right now, our society, and specifically the United States, shows no sign of slowing down the amount of fossil fuels that we are burning.  The rate of carbon that we are currently emitting into the atmosphere is growing exponentially and nobody seems to want to look at themselves or their own impact to try and mitigate the problem.  

                                  <br><br>



I understand that a majority of the blame can be put on fossil fuel, food, and transportation industries for pumping so much CO2 into our atmosphere at such a large rate, but I have found it fairly easy to make little changes in my day to day life that have helped reduce my own carbon footprint.  I have been a pescatarian/vegetarian for 11 years now with spells of going vegan.  I have taken up biking as my main form of transportation and use public transportation whenever I can.  I have gotten involved in numerous climate strikes and other lobbying events as well as sent letters to my local and state politicians in order to make my voice heard on the issues that I am passionate about that are affecting the well-being of billions across the globe.  I have gotten involved with on-campus organizations that promote sustainability at our school such as Greeks Go Green, which implements greener practices in greek life, and Isla Vista Trading Post which hosts clothing swaps to try and mitigate the effects of fast fashion.  I have taken it upon myself to read articles and stay informed on where our country is on the issues of climate change and the efforts that we are taking to try and not kill our planet completely. 

                                  <br><br>



Currently, the average american still buys approximately 64 articles of clothing per year, when in the 1980s it was only 12.  The entire infrastructure of the United States and the economy is not as strong as it seems, but it is based around a source that is not going to last forever and is extremely detrimental to our planet, oil.  So far, we have seen very slow progress towards switching to renewable energy.  The United States, Russia, and Europe are responsible for ⅔ of all global greenhouse gas emissions and 75% of all carbon dioxide that is in the atmosphere was put there in the last 60 years.  These are really scary statistics that hopefully convince all of the climate change deniers (and yes, there are still climate change deniers in 2020) that climate change is a real and dangerous threat and so much of it was put there by humans, specifically humans in first world countries.


                                  <br><br>


It seems as though our world is not taking this issue seriously, but the main problem is that the people who are just caring about making more money are the ones that are in charge right now.  It is their call whether we make the switch to save our planet before it is too late.  Luckily, my generation is taking the issue very seriously and is making amazing strides with the resources that we are allocated towards mitigating the problems at hand.  We are growing up with more conscious habits and sustainable practices are becoming the norm.  We are living in an age of change and passion for what we know is right and with enough of us caring, we are making a difference.


                                  <br><br>


I make this pledge to you, my future children, that I will do everything in my power to create a safe and healthy future for you.  I will continue to fight the fight against huge corporations that are pumping tons and tons of CO2 into our atmosphere and are generating huge amounts of waste in the process.  I will eat and live in the most sustainable ways that I can, I will practice slow travel, I will thrift all of my clothes, and I will do everything that I can to make sure that you will not only have a planet to be born into, but a clean one. 

                                  <br><br>



Best,
                                  <br><br>

Your Sorry Mother

A message from the future
                                  <br><br>


             It was only after taking the English 23 course in the 2019/2020 school year that I realized the urgency of the issue. While I was already aware of the climate crisis threat, I had not yet been exposed to the severity of it or of how imminent the issue was. Before taking the course I had already decided to not eat beef for environmental reasons however after taking the course I transitioned to a diet that avoided all red meat. A year later I become vegetarian and not long after fully transitioned to a freeganism diet. 

                                  <br><br>

             In the 2020 election the democratic party won and took back the house. Within less than a year the Green New Deal passed brining about an environmental awareness in politics that had never been seen before. For the first time in history political action was being taken to address climate change. While initially incremental, political measures being taken exponentially became more prevalent. Although republicans were initially in opposition to these newly proposed laws and regulations, the worsening consequences of climate change ultimately led to both the democratic party and republican party to unite as a single front on the issue of climate change.

                                  <br><br>

            In 2035 the public has begun the major transition from privately owned cars to the widespread use of public transportation. With lawmakers in agreeance on implementing measures to reduce climate change, public transportation infrastructure has vastly improved becoming the leading method of travel. Bike lanes and pedestrian sidewalks networks have also been vastly expanded. In addition, a heavy carbon tax has been placed on all air travel. In place of this transnational railways with express trains have replaced cross country travel.
                                  <br><br>


           In addition to this all buildings have carbon emission limitations they must abide by while tax incentives are given to buildings that meet LEED certifications. The use of wind, solar, and hydroelectric power have become the most prevalent sources of energy. A transition away from fossil fuels has already begun and fossil fuel companies are now being forced to pay for climate related damages and adaptations.Single use plastics have all been banned and new methods of microplastic ocean removal have been developed but are in their early stages. Companies are stringently held accountable for any emissions or waste they produce. 
                                  <br><br>


By 2060 it is my generation that has completely altered the course of climate change. We no longer live in fear of the consequences we will face but cherish the peacefulness of the nature around us. In 2060 we will not look back regretting how little we did, instead we will look back proud of the measures we took.

A message from 2020,                                  <br><br>

Hello me, or whoever is reading this in 40 years. I am about to finish Ken’s course on the climate crisis where I, and many other students at UCSB and others online, have learned about what can go wrong if the climate crisis goes on unchecked. I have also learned of many different ways to fight against this crisis on a personal and political level. Hopefully not only you, but many other people and governmental authorities have adopted practices that prevented the total destruction of our planet. Since you have access to this letter, I assume not all society has crumbled. 
                                  <br><br>
We are currently in the midst of another crisis. The COVID-19 infectious disease is spreading like wildfire right now. Everyone is encouraged to distance themselves from other people, as many public events and gatherings are being canceled. Italy has issued a nationwide lockdown to prevent further spreading of Coronavirus. Governments around the world are taking action to mitigate the effects this pandemic may cause if left to its own devices. Clearly, people and governments have the ability to take more drastic action when crisis occurs. Although, personally I do not believe that they are doing as much as they can, this is much more proactive than the response to the climate crisis. 
                                  <br><br>
I am sure that drastic measures will be taken against the climate crisis. I just hope that it is not too little too late. It is clear that many government officials and corporate interests refuse to acknowledge the reality that we are currently facing, but I know that they eventually will have to do something about it. They must somehow be convinced of the right path to take before the climate crisis is far past the point of no return.
                                  <br><br>
We have a governmental proposal known as the Green New Deal, although I hope that you have heard of it or still remember it. It is the most progressive action against the climate crisis I have seen coming from the government. A current presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, has outwardly supported it so I hope that he wins the election over his Democratic peer, Joe Biden, who seems not as enthusiastic about it, and the incumbent president, Donald Trump, who outright believes that climate change is a hoax. I hope at least some measures of the Green New Deal have been put into effect to slow down climate change.
                                  <br><br>
Although very unlikely, maybe there are no longer any personal cars on the road anymore. It would be cool to see extremely reliable and efficient public transport being widely utilized. I believe that by 2060 this is completely possible. In fact, I think we already have the technology to do so; we just don’t have the support necessary, both financial and social. 
                                  <br><br>
How’s the meat industry doing? Hopefully the amount of livestock being raised has decreased dramatically. I personally plan on cutting back on my meat consumption, especially beef. I’ll try to start eating plant-based meals at least a couple days a week. Maybe I’ll even transition to less meat. I highly doubt that I will be able to cut meat out entirely, but there is a small possibility. I mean, I haven’t ever tried eating lentils every day, but maybe I’ll like it. 
                                  <br><br>
Overall, I just hope enough action is taken so humanity doesn’t set off a completely unstoppable spiral of worsening climate, death, and disease. This class has taught me the simple changes I can make in my life to play my part in this process. Hopefully you are living a good life free of climate related catastrophes and Coronavirus. In fact, I just received an email that our final is beings canceled due to Coronavirus. Times are chaotic…

                                  <br><br>

To my dearest friend,

                                  <br><br>

It’s hard to believe that only forty years ago we were still trudging our way through university, unsure of what we wanted to do, who we wanted to be, and what the future had in store for us. I think we can both agree that at the ripe old age of sixty, the world and our place in it has radically changed. But that’s not what surprises me. Remember when I told you about that climate change course I took sophomore year of university? I said that for better or for worse, change was inevitable. We only had two options really. Either we changed our ways in an attempt to preserve the planet, or the planet would rumble its change and the life within it could either find some way to adapt or die.

                                  <br><br>

Looking back, I think that this country could have and should have done more. By the time those in power reached a general consensus, it was too little too late. If the United States of America had acted decisively back in 2020, I think the world our children and grandchildren are growing up in would be a place more reminiscent of our own youth. And yet, perhaps not. But what I do know is this. The new generation must now grapple with the legacy we failed to stop several decades prior and who can we blame but ourselves? A few weeks ago, my grandchildren asked me why we had to let those animals (verbatim: “the white bears that walked on solid water”) disappear and I didn’t know what to say so I answered with the truth.
                                  <br><br>


Of course, I must set aside a portion of this letter to thank you. You might not have always understood my actions and you certainly were skeptical at times, but in the end you always came around to support me. It’s funny how life works sometimes. How ten weeks of your life has the power to radically shift your outlook. Ten weeks of discussions with hundreds of my peers on Youtube (honestly, I never actually thought Google would go obsolete, but that’s a discussion for another day) somehow worked to change the way I reflected upon my lifestyle, my vision for my own future, and what the pursuit of happiness really meant to me. At the end of those ten weeks, I felt even more confused and unsure but I knew if I didn’t take a leap of faith, I would spend the rest of my life asking myself “what if”. And at least writing this letter to you today, I’ve realized that while I do have regrets, I know that as my own person, I did the best I could in the circumstances I was given. Looking back, I do feel like I did enough. But I wasn’t alone. 
                                  <br><br>


The way we actually ended up spending our roaring twenties was definitely not how we had originally planned in our teens. The first thing I basically forced both of us into was converting us both to a climatarian and eventually a vegetarian diet. (You can deny it all you want but I can tell you really do like tofu now!) Instead of taking the plane to travel far and wide, we biked and took the high speed train. I’m still not fully convinced it’s the journey that matters and not the destination but I can’t bring myself to regret it. Instead of both owning a car like we had originally hoped, we moved to a big city and learnt first hand that buses and subways  really were never on time. Now that is something that’s changed for the better. Microhousing was quite the eye opening experience. Living in such a small space helped us realize that once the emphasis placed on stuff was eliminated from our lives, it opened up the time to appreciate other things. Not having the space to keep so many unnecessary products meant we spent less time focusing on money and we focused more on doing what really mattered. 
                                  <br><br>


Those climate protests we took part in before the Green New Deal finally passed were for the history books (no seriously, their learning about  it in elementary school). I never thought you’d meet your future husband  when we were getting arrested at one of those said protests but you always did have a way of doing the unexpected. Finally, when I look at the world today and see a place where women no longer have to fight for access to education and control over their own bodies, I feel… well, I can’t quite describe how moving that is to me. 

                                  <br><br>

Indeed, much has changed. The landscape of the world we live in today would have been unrecognizable to our past selves. The new technology of today could only be found in science fiction when we were still students. But it’s not all bad. After all, we’re still alive and humanity still dares to dream big. The dreams of our children and grandchildren do not revolve around more money, faster cars, and bigger houses. In fact, the idea of prioritizing such things is foreign to them. 

                                  <br><br>

The future now belongs to the new generation — to our children and their children — and what fills me with hope is that they still have the power to make their own path. What I feared most forty years ago is that the children we brought into this world would be robbed of their choices because of the irrevocable damage we let happen to this world. So while I am filled with melancholy when I think about all that has been lost, I cannot help but laugh when I see that the youth of today can still see brightness in tomorrow.

To my grandchildren,
                                  <br><br>


It’s already March, and we are just about to take a biking tour in Amsterdam, where we currently live, once your father returns from university in the States. Since your grandmother and I are just sitting here awaiting his arrival, we decided we would write you this letter so you could understand how times were when your father was going to university, and even get to look back into the past on and get a chance to hear about how things were for your grandmother and I back in our university days.
                                  <br><br>


The year was 2020, and even though most of us were concerned with the pandemic of coronavirus (Can you still believe that happened? Or did you even hear about it?)The largest, underlying issue with the world wasn’t necessarily about people’s health, but the planet’s. Back then, there raged a constant debate whether us, humans, were creating climate changes such as global warming and cooling or altering wind patterns, or if it was just a hoax made up by crazy people who didn’t care for the advancement of technology. We continuously tried to implement change; have new government policies to help protect the earth, put a cap on carbon dioxide emissions, reduce single use items (if you even know what those are), but unfortunately, it took a long time for non-believers to actually come to the realization that we were creating anthropogenic climate change that could soon kill our planet (Even as near as 2040!).
                                   <br><br>

When your father was born in 2037, thankfully he didn’t have to concern himself with this threat of global destruction, as there was a huge change sparked years before he was born. However, what I will say is, times got rough for all of us. The United Nations finally assembled in 2026 after the world had come to the conclusion that climate change was real and was occurring at a rate quicker than ever before. They decided to put a mass carbon tax on companies, as well as enforcing countries to shut down all fracking sites with monthly inspections to follow. Things moved fast and chaotic once the price of gasoline inflated to an extent like no other, but luckily that devastation  to the market is behind us. We are still recovering after so long, but things should be better than we had it when you become the age your father is in now. The government is continuously implementing newer and stricter measures, such as constant carbon emission reduction number countries must beat, which is difficult, but you come to comprehend that it's for the greater good.
                                   <br><br>

I hope you receive this in the near future so you can look back on a big moment in our history through the small perspective of your grandfather. I hope you and your father are doing well. Let me know if you read this if I’m still around!

                                  <br><br>

Lots of love,

                                  <br><br>

Hey. It is your cool and fun mom. I am writing this letter in 2020 when times were much different than how they are now. I can’t exactly pinpoint what life in 2060 is like for us, but I hope that the world was able to awake from the deep naive sleep we are currently in and save the planet and ourselves. I hope that I was able to continue caring the way I deeply do now about my personal actions not adding to the unfortunately growing issue that is climate change. I pray that my generation finally begins to be the change that we need to see in the world in order to protect you and ourselves. I can barely imagine what your life is like, but I once again have to emphasize that I hope we were able to save the planet for you. I want to remind you of what my relationship with the planet was like now as well as prior to me enrolling in the climate change course at UCSB, just so you can see how much our lives are different. I especially prior to taking climate change 101, typically eat meat as a protein twice a day. I, when living in Los Angeles, take my car everywhere every time I leave the house and never ride my bike in Los Angeles. My car runs on gas which I fill up almost every two weeks, and I pay way too much for it. My favorite thing to eat is probably a good steak, which after this course I can proudly say I have not had in two months. I did not think much about the growing temperatures around me, and did not have hurricanes or tornadoes in California. Even though I am clueless as to what your daily life looks like, I know that it will be drastically different than mine. I want to tell you about how my life is beginning to change in 2020. I from the start of this year have been eating a much more plant based diet and have been avoiding all red meat. I ride my bike everywhere and take the bus to farther places. I carpool back to home in Los Angeles or take the train, but never drive by myself. To you, this might seem like a common lifestyle. This might be how you live your everyday life with no question. These changes, even though none of them are drastic, are all new to me. Eating in dining halls makes me a bit hungry sometimes considering the lack of sustainable food options, but in that case I just eat some more beans and call it a day. I am currently adapting to a more sustainable lifestyle and trying to figure out what works for me. My next goal is to cut out dairy, so wish me luck. I am looking into moving to New York City after college in order to live in a city and make my sustainable lifestyle easier. I want to live my life so that I can have you and bring you into a safe inhabitable world. However, not everyone is able to see this issue in the same way I do. I'm sure by the time that you read this climate change will no longer be an idea or listed as a political scheme, but will be a more than accepted fact. As for now in 2020, many people are living in denial or are truly uneducated. Even some of my friends are incapable of understanding why my friend Tess and I choose not to eat specific things for dinner and avoid other actions that negatively affect the environment. At some point unfortunately, they will understand why we acted this way in 2020. I am curious as to what our life is like together in 2060. We will definitely live in a smaller home than I had previously anticipated, but I want us all to be happy and healthy together. For all I know, we are living together on Mars. Just know that many of us living in 2020 did try. We voted for political candidates who cared (or pretended to care) about climate change and took individual action to help you and our future selves in whatever way we could. Once we became educated about the true circumstances and conditions of our environment in 2020, we worked as hard as we could to ensure that there would be a future for you. Just know that we're currently working on it. Maybe not in as large numbers as we need to make a true dent, but we are trying. I understand that our efforts could be larger and I wish that we were all motivated as the leading individuals living their lives in full to prevent what seems like the inevitable future. The class I took at UCSB called climate change 101 was able to fully pinpoint the importance and duty I felt to protecting the future of our earth and you. Prior to this class, I would have never thought about what my future life with kids would be like with climate change involved. From the casual day dream here regarding my future with kids it has begun to impact every decision I make everyday. How I am going to get to class, what I am going to eat, and almost everything in between now relates not only to my future but the future of my unborn children. This is crazy to me now and I am sure will be crazy for you to think about in the future. 
                                  <br><br>
Sincerely,                                   <br><br>

                 Your loving Mom who cared from 2020 and still cares now

<p>
By the time you read this, you should be 18. I’m writing you this in March of 2020, a couple months away from my 20th birthday, and my whole life just went a little bit crazy. I’m a freshman at UCSB, and soon after you read this letter, you’re probably going to be going off to college yourself. And while this whole time-capsule thing is an assignment for a class I’m taking (English 23: The Climate Crisis – if the course website is still up by then I’ll show it to you), I guess it’s as good time as any to let you know what’s going on with the world.
                                  <br><br>
The United States presidential election is about to happen, and it’s looking more and more likely that President Donald Trump is going to be reelected. That’s what we call an “F”, a major tragedy. World War III almost broke out in January, which was pretty scary but rendered some pretty funny memes. There has been a major viral outbreak that’s threatening the health system worldwide which means I’m essentially stuck in the US until the craziness has died down. And did I mention the world is in the brink of collapse due to climate change? Fun stuff, that’s for sure.
                                  <br><br>
2020 is proving to be a year where we can see humanity’s extremes: the selfish side and the empathetic side. With the Coronavirus, we see hundreds of people here in the USA and in other countries buying massively unnecessary amounts of toilet paper, cleaning supplies, masks and gloves. This means that a lot of other people who also need some of these supplies are going without! Some other people (specifically a bunch of my high school friends in Brazil) don’t care at all about what’s happening; they keep frequenting places of agglomeration such as parties, buses, shopping malls, etc. and while they are okay with getting the disease since it’s “just a flu”, they don’t take into consideration that they might be transporting said virus to a person that could suffer severe consequences from it. It’s a lot of selfishness out in the world all at once. Bu there is also the global and local efforts that are being made to protect other people. By choosing to stay home people are already having a big effect into the outcome of this crisis.
                                  <br><br>
My hope is that we can take from this experience and learn how to be empathetic with the world around us. Just like the Coronavirus is causing havoc in our lives, we are wreaking havoc in the planet. While some people aren’t affected at all by changes in temperatures, rise in sea level, bad air quality, pollution, etc. vulnerable groups of people are suffering and will continue suffering and we need to take collective action to change this. I hope that by the end of this year, and all the way into your eighteenth birthday I can reduce my meat and dairy consumption to twice weekly at most. I already have implemented some minimalism in my life by donating a lot of my clothes, by choosing to not by new electronics just for the sake of having the newest gadget, and by trying to recycle and repurpose things inside my home (even if it’s just a college dorm for now). Hopefully by the time you get to read this letter things have changed and that I do an okay job at parenting and have passed a long all of these things I’ve been learning in college so that you can do better than me, because god knows that not eating meat when you grew up with a barbecue a week is pretty hard. 
                                  <br><br>
By the next election there will hopefully be a democratic candidate that will enforce some changes in congress, make the Green New Deal actually happen perhaps. Maybe by then I’ll be a citizen and be able to vote and be a part of the change! Only time will tell, Oliver. I hope this letter finds you well, and I hope that the world my generation has left for you is better than the one my parents and grandparents left for me.

Dear son/daughter,                                   <br><br>

This is your mother here from 2020, I know seems like ancient times right? Well, I’m sure you have seen pictures from this time and if they are pictures from your mother’s old Instagram you may think the world was so beautiful and nature seemed “untouched” and so green. However, as you know now since you are living in it, the world was drastically crumbling at this time and it was because of my generation and the generations before me that made the planet look the way it does now. This may be crazy to wrap your head around but my generation is the last generation to be taken pictures of as a baby with real cameras ONLY and not with iPhones or the camera on your phone. The iPhone came out when I was in 4th grade and since then technology has been evolving faster and faster while destroying the environment as it goes. To this day the iPhone 11 has just come out and who knows what technology there will be while you’re reading this but I sure do hope that consumerism and the development of “new” things has faded out and our society focuses on the more important things. Of course, this is very unlikely and this is because of the people alive right now. I am trying my hardest to reduce my carbon footprint so that you will be able to see the most beautiful earth as I saw it. Currently, I am on my 7th year of being a vegetarian to reduce my carbon footprints and hopefully, soon I can transition to a completely plant-based diet. I even have transitioned my boyfriend at this time to become a vegetarian. People nowadays are trying to reduce their plastic by using paper straws and reusable bags, which of course I do as well but I honestly find this quite ironic as this is just a small factor of what’s destroying our earth. People do these things yet consume and consume and CONSUME like it is nobody’s business. I buy things to the minimum and of course once in a while I get new clothes at second-hand thrift stores but I rarely ever buy things off the internet any longer, especially useless items and clothes that won’t be trendy in a month. I truly believe that consumerism is feeding into the climate crisis and nobody will stop! It is my job now to stop this and the least I can do for you is reduce my own carbon footprint as much as I can and then educate others which will hopefully do the same.

Dear Future Self:
                                  <br><br>


I am currently writing this at eighteen years old on March 11 2020 with currently no idea what is going on or what the future holds. As of yesterday chaos broke loose with the pandemic of the Corona Virus and now a lot of your education is in question. While I am happy this is my last assignment ever in my English 23 Climate Crisis class, I am a little pessimistic now knowing the state that our planet is in. There are horrible natural disasters happening every year and as we go on there seems to be more and they're getting more destructive. They haven't personally affected me yet but I know they will. As of right now I am currently vegetarian and it is extremely hard. Actually it isn't so bad here at UCSB because I eat in the dining hall and both of my roommates are vegetarian but I know once I go home I most likely will eat meat. It's an ongoing process but I am trying!  As of currently my carbon footprint has gone down quite an amount due biking everywhere,using clothespins, changing my diet, etc.The biggest lesson I have learned is how easy it is to change if you really want to. It isn't this life or death situation like many people make it out to be.I am however  curious and scared about  the future of my children. I have no intention to have kids anytime soon yet I am still here worried about their future and if they will even change. The year is 2020 and there is still so much hatred in the world for minorities and we still struggle to give basic human rights to everyone. The ignorance in America astonishes me every day but I still have optimism that we will eventually make change. As of right now there is so much that has to be done such as educating America properly on what climate change is and what needs to be done. As for what I think the future has for the entire globe I honestly don’t know. It has been proven time and time again that anything can happen. I am pretty confident that the democrats will win back the White House but  I am not so sure if Bernie will be the one to do it. I also feel like they’re won’t be any change in the near future until something catastrophic happens that forces us to change our lifestyle. We will work smarter not harder in terms of making improvements like refusing to change our diet but installing expensive solar panels on our houses. There is no doubt  that the Green New Deal will come into effect eventually but I feel it will do more damage to families before doing good. This one I am personally scared about because both of my parents work under a fossil fuel job. As much as I support getting rid of fossil fuels all together, I don’t think any replacement jobs will come as promised and that would throw my entire family into chaos. I am confident that human rights, such as the right to abortion and healthcare will eventually granted to everyone as America finally opens their eyes. Overall I think America and the rest of the world will be just fine in time and the state of our planet will be restored one way or another.

Dear granddaughter, 
                                  <br><br>


I've decided to write this for you on the day you arrived to this world. I can't quite believe I’m here to see your beautiful face. I told your mother that she should read this to you so that you may know your history, and the part that we all played in the world you will grow up in today. 40 years ago (gosh it seems like such a long time ago) we were at the turning point. My generation demanded change, a call to action that seemed impossible. There was a voice in my head that kept whispering that there was no hope, that it was too much and too little time and we would never be able to pull together. 

                                  <br><br>

That voice was right-for a time. As the 2020 elections drew near, a pandemic shut down the USA. It was one of the greatest cases for mass hysteria the world had ever seen. And then the democrats took the presidency. It was another old white guy, but hey, at least he was competent. It would be another couple presidencies before we saw a woman in office, but this old white guy at least addressed the climate issue. He established the first concrete infrastructure that would serve as the base for every solution that came after it. He also began mending the deep divide between republicans and democrats. A couple years later, everyone got on board. 

                                  <br><br>

In college I studied ES and psychology, and I was working with colleagues to figure out how to best get people to understand the state of emergency that we were in. Legislation helped those that were complacent, but we implemented new ways of educating the youth to drill the importance of ES from a young age. Your mother's generation was one of the first to have zero waste. You’ll never fly in a plane, but there used to be hundreds every day. I took at least one every year until i was in my late 20’s, before they finished the national rail. One of my best friends worked on the new designs. It took a lot of money, and a lot of time, but we redesigned the way we traveled. 

                                  <br><br>

I wouldn't have believed it 40 years ago. There was that voice in my head at every obstacle that kept telling me to give up. That it was too hard. It was everyone around me that kept me going, that pushed and fought as hard as I did. Every time I thought it was too hard I just had to look up, to realize that everyone in the room wanted the same things, and that they were willing to fight for them. We were stronger together.

A Message From the Future

                                  <br><br>

Hi there, this is a message from 2060. Today is my 59th birthday. I don’t know how time travels these years since the year I was sitting in a college lecture hall seems like yesterday. In my 60 years’ life, I have been well informed of the climate crisis we’re facing since my kindergarten period and endured the disasters that have happened since in my school days. I still can remember clearly the Australian fire and the various kinds of virus that nearly killed us. I remember I stumbled hardly to get back home at the start of 2020 due to coronavirus, and the last quarter of my freshman year couldn’t reach a happy ending. I don’t think most of the people would tie those miseries together and to see if these were the feedback we got from nature. But reality has told us: nature was treating us the same way we treated her.
                                  <br><br>


With the knowledge I gained from my college course, I started practicing proper vegetarianism. I was not comfortable at all at first, for I was addicted to meat for every meal. But then I accommodated to life with sustainable food and kept myself healthy. Vegetarianism became a part of my life the year I graduated from graduate school. Later when I started working, I reduced my flying travels as much as possible by combining several short trips to a long one and using remote convention. I’m glad that a portion of the firms encourages employees to do so. 

                                  <br><br>

My hometown started co-housing and high-density community life before I was born, but our society kept a spirit of comparing and buying more and bigger apartments for decades. As we all know, development is coming with the cost of destroying the environment. When smog became a disaster, the government started action and attempted to ameliorate the situation. But they didn’t really “want” to do that with the cost of the stagnated economy. The situation continued to deteriorate for decades until recently more and more people start thinking about saving the planet based on their good economic condition, and the situation is just like that of the US forty years ago. 
                                  <br><br>


I don’t want to talk that much except sharing my future experience. Again, “Being the Change” is a nice real-life example for us all to follow. I don’t have so much to “say,” but I would like to act. Stay well-informed and updated, and at the same time start acting. 
                                  <br><br>


Wish you all the best, people and the Earth.

<p>

To whoever comes upon this worthy letter 40 years from now,

                                  <br><br>

It is 2060. It is my responsibility to explain the year 2020 and its significance on climate change in 2060. I turned a blind eye and decided not to vote that year. My fellow peers, roommates, and friends decided to give their full support for Bernie Sanders. Like every other year, I hesitated to cast my vote against this particular situation. Why did I not vote? Because I strictly believed regardless of any political actions I could have taken, the world was doomed from the start. I thought maybe these climate scientists were being 'alarmist' and maybe Donald Trump was right. That Earth's unusual global warming was completely normal. Despite increasing temperatures, natural disasters and millions of people being affected by the Earth' climate change; I still did not care.

                                  <br><br>

 Why? I was too addicted to the consumerist society. I thought of buying more shoes, having the best clothes and eating whatever I wanted meant I was living a good life. At that time, all I wanted was to get rich and live a materialistic lifestyle. What did it matter for me if thrid Wolrd countries like China, Bangladesh, and India would going through hell because of the U.S and Europe. You see that was the problem of our generation during 2020 that we did not care at all. I am most guilty because I took English 23 in my sophomore year of college and was informed about the true damages of climate change.  Still, I did not take the class seriously. I often chose to work on other class assignments while the professor Hiltner was preaching the very truth Americans did not want to hear during that time. Now it is too late, 2060 is an inhabitable Earth. However, this was not all brought by a single person. It took millions of irresponsible and egotistic individuals to fail to address climate change. The rich got richer and the poor got poorer. Everybody continued to live their carbon full lifestyles like there was no tomorrow. Flights and more flights. Cars and even more cars. And don't forget about the meat. We felt like could not live with these privileged accommodations that put the world in a hurry. 
                                  <br><br>


 The reason I say this is because your generation should not be paying for our broken plates. It deeply saddens me now that the entire Earth environment will be completely submerged by the year 2065. I ask you to forgive us. Our actions have led your generation to complete disaster. If the planet Earth can be saved, please for the love of God do not make the same mistake as us. Mother nature has punished us for our selfish acts. If there is a thing I want you to be left with is to have a simplistic outlook on life. Living life simply is living life happily .

To the future generations, 

                                  <br><br>

The year is 2060 and I regret to inform you that this world you are being born into will be ending its life before you do. I am writing this letter for a time capsule, in regards to our dying planet. I am hoping this can bring you all clarity as you grow up with many questions. In the year of 2020 I was embarking on the journey of graduating with a sociology degree from University of California, Santa Barbara. It was the year that Donald Trump was re-elected for another 4 years and remained in office. At a time where our human population desperately needed to be united, we were driven apart even further. He advocated for a society that revolved around discrimination, racism, and ignorance. Our knowledge of the climate crisis was at an all time high, yet our own president did not “believe” in it. The increasing methods of communication through social media platforms provided tools for a call for action around the globe. All of the information about our climate was accessible, yet it seemed like only a small percent of the world’s population cared. It has been a continuous and defeating fight for the last 40 years, and knowing we could have prevented this outcome puts me at a loss for words. While I was attending UCSB I took a climate crisis course and I remember one day we watched a video that our professor had made and it was an apology to our generation. An apology that consisted of reasons why we were seemingly faced with this inevitable doom that was the result from the generation priors’ careless actions. I sit here now typing this letter with the pain in my heart to share with you that we owe you an apology. I can’t imagine growing up with only the sight of domesticated animals, everything wild or exotic being from a story. I can’t imagine having foliage kept in facilities for “safe keeping” instead of your everyday surroundings. The water you drink from is contaminated, and the air you are breathing is dangerous. The damage that has been caused is too far-gone, and unfortunately you all are the ones that will experience the end of it. I can promise you that we had the knowledge and the manpower to combat this crisis however our inability to create a movement of global action stood in our way. Our generation was built along side with the advancement of technology creating an obsessive desire to be individualistic. The combination of wanting more of everything, and than to have those things become bigger and better, combined with the obsession of needing everything for us was one of the deciding factors of our doom. Mass production and consumption was our deadliest desire. Our sense of selves was lost through vortexes of unattainable online ideals and we were unable to be brought back down to reality. The crazy part is that we were a generation that was aware of these issues, and ready to fight for it. It was discouraging that the plea for help fell on all of us, yet for the majority of our lives the positions of power that could help us were held by those in older generations that wronged us. We underestimated the power that our voices would have had if we were to have fought louder and harder. We tried for years following Donald Trump re-election, however when the new conservative president was elected the hope that we could do anything was lost. We lost the motivation and gave up on the pursuit for what felt like a lost cause. I am here today writing to tell you that on behalf of our generation I am sorry. I wish we were able to have done more. It is not fair that you have to live out your life in this kind of climate, but I guess you haven't seen how good it was before.

I see a future very different from the present. One in which humanity changes its ways for the better. A world that doesn’t rely on fossil fuels, where everyone learns the errors of their ways, and where we can strive to inform and improve ourselves for the greater good. That world is filled with people that seek to create a sustainable future for everyone to continue living in.
                                  <br><br>

But that reality will come too late. 
                                  <br><br>

I don’t see humanity changing its ways until it is forced upon them. We’ll go about our lives, indulging in our gluttony until all of the resources we consumed from the Earth fatten our stomachs to the point of bursting. The people now are content to live their lives wallowing in blissful ignorance because of the scale of the issue. “Everyone else does it, what effect would I really have by changing my actions? Climate change isn’t that bad, why worry about it? By the time we really see the effects of it, I won’t be around, so who cares what I do now?” These are questions that the complacent ask in order to justify their behavior and to reassure themselves that everything will be fine in their own little bubbles.
                                  <br><br>

It will not be fine. Those bubbles will burst when temperatures continue to climb and more people throughout the world will die because they cannot live in those conditions. Landscapes will be scorched and crops razed in the ensuing fires from rising temperatures, leading to food insecurities and mass migrations when undeveloped countries become nigh-uninhabitable. Sea levels will rise and overtake the beautiful sights from people’s childhoods. And this will happen because we could not change fast enough.
                                  <br><br>

The dissemination of false information and division between people will be the downfall of America in its inability to change in time. Groups and interests that stubbornly remain set in their ways will fight to their last breath in denial of the crisis, all so they can drill the last dollar possible from the coffers of the Earth. Nature will not discriminate between party lines, yet the very existence of the crisis is a partisan issue? It will be too late when we can stop fighting over whether the issue exists, and start collaborating over how we can solve the issue. The upheaval of the current system is a large-scale effort that will require massive change, and people are resistant to changing what currently works for them. 
                                  <br><br>

The children of tomorrow will be the ones that suffer the most. We will have to explain how we didn’t take care of their home, didn’t care enough to take care of it, even though it’s the only one we have. How life was easier for us, yet is so much harder for them because of our negligence. Perhaps there will be a silver lining, and we can avoid the worst-case scenario. Humanity has been shown to come through and rise above in times of crisis, but is this crisis too herculean of a task to be solved? We’ll see in due time.

In 2060, I will be 61 years old (oh my god). As Professor Hiltner asks, here is a message from the future: 
                                  <br><br>

16 days before I turned 21 years old, it was March, and it seems as though our world is coming apart. Our schools shut down, quarantines are in place, planes are grounded, and society is crumbling. But it’s not because of the climate crisis – it’s because of another threat: the coronavirus. But the virus is causing people to do exactly what climate activists have been urging people to do for years. Stop flying. Eat differently. Limit travel. And the list goes on. Is this directly related to climate change? Perhaps not. But this is a glimpse into our future. Nothing is normal at this moment in time, and everyone is starting to sense that. But what people don’t seem to get is that this is our future unless we do something about it. 
                                  <br><br>

It was 2020, and as Professor Hiltner points out in the video, we could not begin to imagine what is coming next. AOC’s film gives us a glimpse into what will happen – showing how people were scared of what was coming, but too scared to turn society on its head – but it’s not enough. People could not imagine what is coming next, and it’s terrifying. My parents noted that how they’d never seen anything like this societal collapse in their lifetime. But they still don’t believe in climate change and how it will contribute to a similar collapse. This entire class was about education. Yet I could not tell my parents I am taking a class on climate change, because they would call it a waste of an education. Looking back, this was our new normal. We hadn't done enough to change it. 
                                  <br><br>

AOC had done more to fight for my generation than politicians for decades before her. Our generation needed our future, because without any action, a society like we’re seeing now – one in the face of the coronavirus – won’t be out of the ordinary. And now, I know. This was our new normal. We knew, 40 years ago, what our world would look like. I had hoped we could change it. If we could have radically changed the course of our future, we will have been safe. If we can move past the skepticism, we will be safe. If we had moved drastically, we would have been safe. And that's what we had hoped for. But I don't believe it was enough.




</p><hr>


<p>
I hope our culture can shift to a mindset of care for the future of our planet and its inhabitants, but I'm doubtful as far as people's personal choices go. It's hard to have faith that enough people would work to make the right changes before it's too late. I think for most people in this country, something such as this climate change crisis won't become enough of a reality in their heads until it jumps right in their faces. If only everyone took a class like this which puts important information on the subject in front of the student, the masses would begin to understand the severity of the situation. Even so though, how many of us that took this class are really going to change our lives in a dramatic way. I for one am happy to implement some of the more planet friendly lifestyle choices, because of their relative ease. In my case, examples of these lifestyle changes include little to no airplane flight, long use of clothing and less purchase thereof, smaller house purchases, etc. On the other hand, can I honestly say that I will become a vegetarian or vegan? No. I can do it, but I'm not going to. That being said, I know Ken has mentioned that any change is something, and I agree, but will it be enough? Many many Americans at this point wouldn't even think about trying to change any of those things.
                                  <br><br>

I think our best chance for changing the culture and combatting climate change is more information for more people. This would push more people to decide to make at least some changes, as I did. I don't think that alone would be enough though, so people would need to do more after that, and that's my main concern. I guess we'll see. I hope I'm wrong.

Dear to whoever reads this,

                                  <br><br>


It’s 2060 and I’ve been on this planet for nearly 60 years. I have seen lots of ups and downs throughout the years, but here we still are. When I was a freshman in college I took a course called English 22. I did not know what this course had entailed but I am forever grateful I signed up for it. The following quarter I would enroll in English 23 and continue to learn about the most pressing issue of my lifetime, the climate crisis. 
                                  <br><br>

When I started my college education at UC Santa Barbara in the fall of 2019, the concern of climate change was at an all-time high. The failure by the generations before me to mitigate the climate crisis left this burden on the shoulder of me and my generation. I would be lying to you if I said I wasn’t scared or concerned for my own future, but even for the future of generations to come. I knew I needed to take action personally and create change around the globe to prevent the destruction of all the life on earth. 
                                  <br><br>

As I went through college I started to switch my diet. Despite rarely eating meat, by the time I was graduating in 2023 I was completely vegetarian. I did this to limit my carbon footprint and to help conserve water and lower emissions in the process of transporting meat. It was a struggle to completely eliminate meat considering steak and pork are some of my favorite foods. However, I stuck to it and did it. I also began to write blogs about the devastating effects of rampant consumerism. Thankfully a large majority of the new generations followed in my footsteps and began to live environmentally friendly lifestyles. 
                                  <br><br>

It’s now 2030 and many of the effects I had to go through have been slightly reversed. The Green New Deal has not been completely passed but much of its ideas have been absorbed into a new plan called “The Eco-Friendly Plan”. This plan has completely eliminated fracking and the use of fossil fuels. This plan was created by republicans and democrats who have finally stopped their arguing and came together for the benefit of our country and the world as a whole. This plan sets guidelines for training and transitioning those within the fossil fuel industry to become workers and managers in the new solar and wind industry. This is the industry I am now working as a mechanical engineer. I have been designing and testing new types of solar and wind-powered energy systems in order to keep the carbon emissions low unlike in the decades before. Sadly our generation didn’t do quite enough quick enough. A lot of species went extinct and much of the polar ice has been melted. However, many species still survived and adapted and have been rebuilding their populations. 
                                  <br><br>

By 2050 nearly 75% of the world's population is living in 100% sustainable cities. The switch from suburbs to cities took a bit longer than expected but has been a great success. Not many people drive or fly due to high tech railways that make traveling across the country only a 5-hour trip. Many people have begun to grow their own food or plant with their communities. Capitalism has been redesigned to not leave anyone behind, but also create competition which has made city living affordable for all. 
                                  <br><br>

It’s 2060 and you are living at the same time as me. Despite our efforts, we still can not afford to stop striving to lower the global temperature and greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. I will continue to make as many improvements as I can and leave the planet as inhabitable as possible. Unlike the generations before me, I ensure you that we will educate the youth and not let them follow down the paths of those before us.

To the individual reading this,
                                  <br><br>

I'm writing this in the year 2060. This is almost very weird for me to write in a positive light, considering what detrimental of a state our planet was in during 2020. But I am happy to write that we did it, we truly did it. We, our society, has successfully mitigated the climate crisis and have placed the once dying planet, back into a balanced state. Was this feat easy? Definitely not. This was a long, intensive journey that we have now completed, but I am happy humanity did what we did.
                                  <br><br>

Personally, I didn't think we could do it. I thought we were basically keeping ourselves in track for a emerging doomsday in which the Earth would no longer be inhabitable of life. In 2020, I took one of the most enlightening and empowering courses of my years at UCSB. I enrolled in ENG 23, also known as the Climate Crisis 101. I not only learned so much about the consequences of our pursuits for material wealth and accumulating as much as possible and still wanting more. We were living in a world where nothing else mattered except how much money you had, how big your house was, whether or not you had designer items, or even how "fortunate" enough you were to take flights to other parts of the world. Professor Ken Hiltner truly opened my eyes on the harm we were doing to our planet. We were practicing and supporting industries that were extremely wasteful and had no consideration for the environmental degradation it caused. Adopting a plant-based diet, wasting less food, using public transport, or even buying less new things seemed all too far-fetched for most of the nation. The United States, being one of the world's biggest superpowers, was leading a life of excess and luxury at the expense of everyone else, and most importantly, being completely ignorant to this fact. Yes, there were some well-minded, grounded people who decided to adopt a more climatarian and minimalist lifestyle before the rest of us. However, they still needed more power in numbers which was not granted, given a good majority of people saw them as crazy and unnecessarily living a life of "drab" and "deprivation" when we were surrounded by everything an individual could possibly want. But, this was exactly the problem, we were too focused on desire not necessity. We were mostly a society that wanted the best of the best and as much as possible and was too scared of change and the thought of not having our prized possessions. Policymakers and our government met this demand and wrongly created a system in which profit was above all. There was no respect or showing of responsibility of serving the people and the planet, only caring for corporate interests and economic gain. I can't even imagine what would have happened if we ignorantly continued down this path.
                                  <br><br>

But despite all these struggles, the truly right way of living emerged. We shifted away from animal products, fast fashion, and desires for the fastest method of transportation, the newest technologies, and greater monetary wealth. I'm not writing this for praise or to put our generation on a pedestal. I want to show you that you can be the change for any issues that are facing your generation or world today. With a strong, united front, you can be the movement that will change the world for the better. I want to remind you to practice effective and respectful communication and educate those around you. Also, knowledge alone is not power, it is the actions in which you follow that truly show strength and power. It is never too late to make change and take action. I wish you all well and hope the future is the best. Everyone holds individual power and strength and this grows even more so with support in community and the world.

In 2006, signs of the emergence of a revolution became evident within the US.  As realizations of the upcoming disaster became more prominent, actions began to follow awareness.  The Green New Deal was first introduced to the public.  If only society could have seen the future, maybe they would have taken the policy more seriously before it was too late.  
                                  <br><br>


It wasn't until 12 years later when the Green New Deal became a larger part of the US' 2018 elections.  The inspiring, young, democrat representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pushed for the Green New Deal, but her ideas were laughed at by the opposite party, and she was called too radical by those in her own party.  She was discriminated because of her age and her gender.  If only the public would have known her arguments and proposed policies were to protect future generations and her future kids.  
                                  <br><br>


By 2019, the planet had started to feel symptoms of the deadly disease that was cultivating it.  The nations had failed to reduce their CO2 emissions and pollution, and CO2 levels had risen to over 415ppm.  Ten out of twenty of the most destructive wild fires occurred in California within the four years prior to 2020, and unprecedented events, a tornado touching Ventura harbor near Santa Barbara, was already making history.  A devastating fire burned 13 million acres across Australia, and over fifty percent of the world's Great Barrier Coral Reefs had been lost, yet an effective environmental movement still failed to mobilize.  The democrats won the presidential election in 2020, and perhaps there may have been hope to save countless lives if there wasn't a serious pandemic that put the world into panic, silencing other important policies in the chaos.

                                  <br><br>

In 2025, the serious effects of climate change hit Bangladesh and its citizens.  Sea level rise had made Bangladesh very vulnerable for years, but on February 11th, an earthquake and a resulting tsunami destroyed the nation beyond repair, killing thousands of citizens.  Those who survived were encouraged to move, and millions made the mistake of attempting to move to India.  The prime minister of India, Narendra Modi, a radical yet popular Hindu nationalist, hated the mass Islamic immigration into his country, and implemented extremely harsh anti-immigration policies.  Muslims were discriminated, murdered, and sent back to their deserted, devastated homeland where countless would starve to death or die of other natural causes.  The US did nothing, and the media failed to provide sufficient coverage.  
                                  <br><br>


In the early 2030's, the US started to feel the consequences.  California was on fire, Florida was practically under water as it was being hit by the largest hurricanes to have ever been recorded, and another dust bowl hit the agriculture industries as the lack of care for the land, extremely high winds, and a warm climate made it near impossible to grow crops in such a dry, dusty, and warm climate.  Worst of all, Alaska introduced another pandemic as the extremely hot, anthropogenic climate melted the ice and released an ancient virus.  The virus would have been easy to quarantine if it had not hit during such a delicate time when the US experienced unforeseen amounts of migration into the cities or out of the country to escape local disasters or to find opportunities in highly populated cities.  Despite the chaos, the media failed to address this issue as related to the climate crisis.  The US government pumped money into the economy to help the stock market crash, and further growth was encouraged.

                                  <br><br>

In 2036, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezor AOC, was running for president.  She did what the media could not do: blamed the disasters on the climate crisis and exposed consolidated corporations for exploiting and pumping money into the media to silence environmental policies and science from reaching the public.  Her campaign ran not on politics, but based off of science, facts, and education as she pointed out the flaws of society that had been exploited by corporations who shaped the media to be partial and inaccurate to serve corporate interests.  Her campaign gave an infuriated public someone and something to point at.  The wealthy corporations were currently gaining money from the aftermaths of a growing US economy that was made from a disaster that destroyed homes and killed many.  The disasters of the 2030's gave AOC a rallying call, and once she was nominated as president, her administrations went straight to work on the Green New Deal.  
                                  <br><br>


As many countries started to have similar disasters due to the climate crisis, they looked to the US for help as the US began to lead the world in a sustainable future.

It has been a tough forty years since the 2025 Earth-Life theory. Starting from 2020, there was this new theory predicting that every planet in the universe is alive, and this theory caused complete chaos among society. Scientists from every discipline attempted to disprove this theory using their years of data they have collected about Earth using their advanced equipments. But come to think of it, everything about the past, is only our own interpretation; we might know what dinosaurs look like, but do we actually know how they sound? We think that the big bang created the universe, but who is there to prove the big bang? Even for things like cells and matter, we might be able to see it under a microscope, but are they actually what we think they are? How come cells have life but matter does not? Lastly, this theory explains why we were not able to get in contact with Aliens. As we know of today, any species would need to first harvest the resources on their own planet to grow, and therefore, no civilization could ever past that threshold and make it out of their own planet. 
                                  <br><br>
People started to believe that every virus, every natural disaster is the Earth hinting at us to stop what we are doing or else there would be worse consequences. 
                                  <br><br>
Starting from the 2020s, more and more philosophers begun supporting this idea of our planet being alive and the general public begun to panic. Starting from the Australian fires at the end of 2019 to the Coronavirus epidemic that lasted for two years, humans realized they were not as powerful as they think they are (we probably know more about space than we know about our oceans). We developed a vaccine for the virus in 2021, but who knew this virus did not react as scientists expected; two months after the release of the vaccine, the virus evolved, it is no long only old people who are susceptible to it. The virus kills basically anyone who is in suboptimal health, and that wiped out a large portion of the Earth’s middle class. 
                                  <br><br>
Without a stable middle class, the upper and lower-class people begun to conflict. Thus, the Class War begun in 2028. The war was a brutal massacre, since the upper class had all the resources, they re-established slavery amongst people, race was no long a thing, but class is. The war lasted for a year and three months, but the slavery era after that continued for 10 years. The human population in 2030 stands at 2.6 billion and a large portion of them are slaves. 
                                  <br><br>
But the rich could not exploit the Earth anymore, they are afraid of repercussions, and thus they started sending people into space. We used to think of astronauts as someone who carries honor and pride, but now, this term is solely derogatory to describe people who are destined to die in the process of space exploration. People are sent on journeys to harvest materials in space, and after they finish loading all the resources on to the air shuttle, there would be no more space for the astronauts to come back to Earth. 
                                  <br><br>
It is now the year 2062, I am writing this message on the air shuttle to Saturn, I know that I cannot make it back alive, thus I hope someone could see this message after our crew finish our job and perish.

To me in 2020,                                   <br><br>

Hello. Believe it or not, I’m writing to you in the year of 2060. Fortunately, the earth is still rotating and the human race thriving, thanks to the global awareness of climate change. I remember in 2020 when I was still a college student in UCSB, and I learned about global warming in a course. That was when I first started acting intentionally as a environmentalist. I changed my eating habit to plant-based diet and recommended people around me to do the same. I used bike or buses as transportation instead of private cars. However, most people still haven’t realized the threat of climate during 2020s and average temperature keeps on growing. 
                                  <br><br>

In the 2020 to 2030s, a number of disastrous events took place in all over the world. Glaciers melted and caused a significant rise of sea level. Tornado and hurricanes attacked many countries. Wildfire spread over large forests and burnt down everything. I couldn’t remember how many people lost their lives and homes during the series of natural disasters caused by global warming. Viruses thrived and spread among all the continents because of continuously high temperature.  After that was when all governments finally started to acknowledge the fact that we’re doomed if we don’t take any action toward the climate crisis. In 2035, the Green New Deal was put into action by an organization consists of a number of developed and developing countries. These countries sacrificed their whole economy structure to cut down carbon emission. Millions of people lost their jobs and people rose against the change, but we made it. International trade was cut down to a number similar to that of the 2000s, and with the development of virtual reality technology, business conferences and education are mostly done online so that people don’t have to take planes as frequently as before. We experienced huge economic recessions, but from my view from 2060, I promise you that it worth. 
                                  <br><br>

Despite the fall in economy, science keeps advancing and focusing more on the planet’s problem. In the 2040s, new method of fueling planes and ships are invented and took the place of fossil fuels in ten years. During the period of time when international transportation was limited, the Internet kept developing and connected people from all over the world. Thanks to the dedication of scientists and the governments’ persistent attitude towards solving global warming, we finally controlled the temperature rise under 2 degrees. Although a few species extinct during the 40 years, we finally found a delicate balance between human living and the sustainability of the planet, and we hope to keep the equilibrium on.




</p><hr>


<p>

How have we handled the world? In the years following this letter and the time we have had, have we done our part? Can we be proud of who we were, both individually and as a generation? 
                                  <br><br>
e next forty years, I hope we can look back and have a better memory of ourself than most. I hope we can say we did our part and reduced our climate footprint. Right now, I know how we live isn’t the best. As a species, how we live isn’t the best. But I hope we took what we learned in English 22 and 23 and we took action. 
                                  <br><br>

The current situation goes as follows. Although plenty of climate scientists (97% of them to be specific) agree that the climate crisis is real and that it is going to mark the next planetary extinction event, there are enough climate deniers that not much action is being taken. The denier movement started only a little more than a decade or two ago, but now it has grown to the point that they are largely in control. You can see a distinction between the deniers and the activists, as the difference is largely generational. The older you are, the more likely you are to want to refuse to change your way of living, and thus the more likely you are to deny climate change. 
                                  <br><br>

The world really depends on the younger generations. Many of us are trying hard- going to protests, voting, changing their current behavior to use the least amount of fossil fuels possible. It just isn’t enough. We need to educate the rest of the population and establish an infrastructure that allows for very little fossil fuel consumption. Many people refuse to be educated, but we need to sway the people who are in between. We also need to get more people to show up to vote. Unfortunately, even with all of the activism already happening, the youngest age group was the one who voted the least in the primary that is currently going on. 
                                  <br><br>

I’ve already changed my diet to cut out beef and eat as little meat as possible. I also try to take the bus as much as I can, rather than take a car, and I avoid buying new clothes in exchange for buying thrifted items. I hope that by the time we have reached 2060, I have done even more, especially after I have graduated from college and am having to make more decisions for myself. Maybe we move into a micro-apartment in a big city. Maybe we walk to work every day. Maybe we become a freegan or a vegetarian. 
                                  <br><br>

I hope it also isn’t just us. We can’t be the only ones who make changes, and it can’t be just the younger generation. By the time I’m reading this, I hope we, as a society, have voted the right people into office, and convinced the deniers who refuse to change, and finally have a little bit more infrastructure to create ease when making these decisions. Otherwise, I fear for the conditions that you’ll be reading this in. Will it be a comfortable yet small apartment with clean air and a safe bike path outside, with little worry about wildfires, hurricanes, or ocean rises? Or will it be in a place full of fear, with smog running rampant, cars still lining every street, and us begging for a second chance?
                                  <br><br>
For now I will do what I can, and hope, with all my heart, that it will be the first choice rather than the second. See you in forty years, future Alysa, hopefully in fondness.
                                  <br><br>
-Yours Truly, back in 2020

To my children, 
                                  <br><br>
It is now 2060 and life has changed into something I have never envisioned happening in the last 20 years, but I’m glad we made the change. Back when I was 18 years old attending college at UC Santa Barbara I decided to take an environmental course called climate crisis that changed my perspective on life itself completely. Before this course I didn’t know much of what was occurring with our planet, all I knew was that we were destroying it very fast with all of our human actions. This course opened up a whole new perspective for my life as we discussed ways we can help save the planet and what would occur if we did nothing. The first thing that came to my mind was the idea of my children in the future living in a dangerous, unsuitable environment that would cause them many unforeseen medical conditions and who knows what else. I didn’t want this to happen as I knew for a fact I wanted to have children one day. So I decided to make major changes and be an advocate for many people who weren’t willing to. For the 2020 election, I voted like many of my other classmates for a president that had promised to implant the green new deal in our political policies and we ended up winning.  We were all so excited about this change that we needed so anxiously as we knew we didn’t have much time to act. Besides just the deal passing and regulating new laws, we as individuals also had to contribute to the reduction of fewer greenhouse emissions by changing some things in our daily life routine. We knew it was going to be hard for a lot of people but we knew it was the right thing to do for our safety and the good of our planet. 
                                  <br><br>
 To begin, some of the major things I committed myself to do in order to enhance my contribution to the green new deal was to change my diet completely to a plant-based diet. Not only did this contribute heavily to reducing my carbon footprint but it also benefits me for my health and overall wellbeing. I completely discarded all animal products and by doing so I wasn’t supporting the killing of cows that produces tons of carbon emission toxins into the air. I was also feeling ten times healthier and happier. In addition to this, I kept advocating and spreading the words to friends, family and new people I met on the way that if I could make these changes in my life so can they. I explained to them the many reasons why they should switch to a plant-based diet and all the benefits that came with it. Some of the other factors that I also helped many others implement was reducing food waste. Wasting food as I learned in 2020 was one of the top 5 contributing factors to climate change, it was responsible for roughly 8% of global emission  As you guys may notice you now understand why momma always says you finish your food or you save it for dinner later but you never throw away food. Another major change I implemented into my life was shopping online and in stores less. I learned that buying a sufficient amount of quality clothes would be better for the environment then buying a piece of clothing every week from a cheap online website or a store. As you can tell my closet isn’t filled with many clothing items but instead with only the necessities. I made these changes as well as other minor ones such as taking public transportation when possible and reducing the times I fly which makes me think that many others could too. I'm proud of the changes we have done and I believe we could keep it this way and have our earth continue to prosper. 
                                  <br><br>
 After a successful 2020 election, many factors started changing and falling into place where we wanted them to. To all environmentalists, it was crucial to have a president that would support the green deal changes and that is exactly what we accomplished. Our new president wasn’t self-centered on purely just how the economy would benefit the massive fossil fuel companies or how this politically would be seen but instead, he cared for the people and our earth. He understood the measures that scientists have been arguing since the 1980s, that our earth was warming due to fossil fuel burnings. Our political system started implementing standards such as guaranteeing a job, a family-sustaining wage, adequate health care expenses, paid vacations and retirement security to all people in the United States. Our president started working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the united states to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector. This made a massive improvement in our environment as beef is responsible for 41% of livestock greenhouse emissions, and which is why I made the decision to change my diet completely avoiding all types of livestock. Transportation was also a major change, our city built several lanes that were safe for all bikers and installed many bike racks. Our government invested in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transportation; and high-speed rail. All of this motivated people to use sources of transportation that greatly reduced the production of emission gases. Since then every president from him has put into effect these measures improving their policies each time to suit the necessities of the public. As you can see my dear children our government has come, a long way years ago back in 2020 it was really hard for everyone to see a change with our previous political system but we made it happen and now we are here saving our planet and we did it all for you guys. We cared about our future generations and we wanted you guys to experience life as well but without the damage, we were causing to our environment. We all put our minds together and made this change happen. It was difficult in the beginning but we made it happen with our actions. As a result, we want to keep it this way so I hope you learn from our ignorant actions and do not repeat what we ignored for so long. Remember together anything is possible in this world. 
                                  <br><br>

Love,

Dear friends, 

                                  <br><br>

This is 2060 now. 40 years after the first day I attend UCSB. The world has a massive change. Everything changes. I guess you know what is the color of the sky right? The color is light blue and the color of the cloud is white. But after everything has changed, the sky becomes grey and cloud become grey also.  I have not seen a blue sky and white clouds for 15 years already. People have to wear masks to go outside. The air pollution is crazy, people can't live without a mask. Also, there is no more season. The only season we have right now is summer. The sea-level rise up five meters. A lot of island countries are disappeared. The polar bear was extinct. Also a lot of other animals. 
                                  <br><br>
The consequences which bring with climate change were big and unreversible, the only things can make this recover is time. The scientists told us that this will take around two to three hundred years. I very very regret that I did not follow what Ken said, Ken is one of the professors in UCSB. He teaches about climate change. The course tough by him is one of my favorite courses at UCSB. I have taken two of his classes. They are ENGL 22 and ENGL 23. I like both of them so much. 
                                  <br><br>
ENGL 22 is talking about the past and ENGL 23 is talking about modern environmental change. Ken gives us a lot of suggestions about how to reduce greenhouse gases releasing, which is the major reason to cause climate change, and how serious the problem is. But at that time people do not care at all. If I can have a second chance, I will 100% listen to what Ken said and follow all the suggestions that he gave us. Please take ENGL 22 and ENGL 23, you will learn a lot. And please follow those suggestions, not until be too late. 

</p><hr>


<p>

40 years ago, over 800 UCSB students registered for a course by Professor Ken Hiltner called The Climate Crisis. Most of them were taking the course to fulfill a GE requirement, unaware of how the course would change them through the next ten weeks. Although some students were still skeptical and reluctant as they acquired more and more knowledge about this urgent issue, it’s without a doubt that the course material inspired varying degrees of fear, uncertainty, and hope in everyone. 
                                  <br><br>


Out of the 800+ students, only about 100 actively pursued a degree or career related to the environment, around 300 continued with their current degrees but still considering climate change as a priority in the way they live, and the rest, conscious of the fact that our the deterioration of our planet was imminent, continued with their lives as they were.

                                  <br><br>

But the dedication of those 400-ish students and those who followed in the future climate change courses at UCSB did not go to waste. Many of them were able to convince a lot of their families and friends to follow their climaterian diets, less wasteful and consumer-driven lifestyles, and shift towards green modes of transportation. 

                                  <br><br>

Young and inspired to make a difference, they fought long and hard for the Green New Deal to finally get passed. By then, however, the time left on the clock was dwindling quickly. The generation that followed became increasingly aggressive in terms of politics and climate activism, dedicating more of their time and energy into saving the planet they wanted their future children to have. 

                                  <br><br>

Today, in the year of 2060, it is greatly looked down upon to have many children, to travel by plane, to drive cars (whether electric or not), to waste food, to eat beef, to go to the mall, to buy new things, and to live in big houses. There are new laws and policies put in place to encourage pro-environment behavior and to penalize any activity that would harm the environment. 

                                  <br><br>

It’s true, we are still a long way from where we need to be. We’re seeing the effects of climate change much more clearly now, but I suppose seeing that our population is pushing 400 million in the U.S. alone, we’re doing our best to move everybody in the right direction. This isn’t an attempt to justify our insufficient actions, but to remain optimistic that we will do more, and soon, because our planet is still dying and we’re the cause of it. 
                                  <br><br>
—                                  <br><br>

But it’s still 2020. I want to hope that 40 years from now, our world will be better off. That the cliffs haven’t crumbled away so much that we can still live in the grossly overpriced apartments on Del Playa. That we can still see the constellations in the night sky and that we still have forests to hike in. That we’ll have taken action faster and more efficiently than I predicted. 

                                  <br><br>

This is our home, and there is no one but us who can make sure that our kids (or our friends’ kids) can still live here. Each and every one of us has the responsibility to make sure of that. As Ken reminded us over and over, “if not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered.” We all have the resources and capabilities to make changes to our lives and the people around us. We just need to start acting on them—now.

My Dearest Daughter,
                                   <br><br>

It seems like yesterday that you were just a little girl, helping plant veggies in the garden, climbing trees, and playing in the dirt, now not much has changed about my favorite little girl, except now she is leaving me to go into the big beautiful world.   
                                  <br><br>
 
Before I really understood about the planet and how fragile, beautiful, and precious it was grandpa Brandt was teaching me to reduce my use of single use plastics, yes there was such a thing! Everything was wrapped in plastic and made of plastic from water bottles to forks, to bags to put all of your produce in. You would walk into a grocery store and everything was wrapped in plastic. Anyway, I grew up a little and took a class in high school about environmental science that I really enjoyed. I don’t remember if I told you this, but in high school I knew I had a passion for the environment, but I really didn’t know what to do with it. Then my junior year of high school Trump got elected into office (you bet I cried; you wonder where you get your emotions from ha). It’s still so weird reading your history assignments because I knew when he got elected that he would be written in history, but to be honest it is nice to read articles and history book where he is talked about in such a negative light from all parties and viewpoints. 
                                  <br><br>
 
Now I am reflecting about grandma and grandpa dropping me off at college, and now my precious daughter is in that place. Wow you are so lucky, I wish I could go to college again.  Before I left for college I “had” to go buy so much to be prepared to live on my own… ha but a few years later I donated and upcycled all that crap and started the minimalist lifestyle. My first year of college I declared as a bio major because I knew I wanted to either do something where I was helping people (physical therapy) or the environment. I surrounded myself with a bunch of amazing people who had a passion for the outdoors and more than ½ of them were vegetarian or vegan and I began talking to them about their reasoning and found out it was for environmental reasons. My second year I cut out meat cold turkey from my diet. (yes, I did eat meat up until I was 18!).  However, it wasn’t until my third year that I got to take more classes in environmental studies. I took a class called writing for sustainability, and basically, I got to read, write and have debates on a bunch of environmental issues. It really opened my eyes to all of the harsh realities of the climate crisis. That class really inspired me to reduce my plastics, and five years down the road I was zero waste! Also my junior year I took this class called the Climate Crisis 101, and wow did that class impact have an impact on me. We talked, read and watched films on the climate crisis, what was happening up until 2020 and what we have to do about it in the small-time frame that we had. There were days when I came home from that class and just felt so sad and lost and looking back a couple weeks later, I figured out because I was so concerned for my future. I didn’t even think I was going to be able to have my precious daughter. That class inspired me to live off more of a plant-based diet, although it wasn’t until about 6 years later that I became completely plant based. I swore to myself to limit my flying as much as possible. Yes, we used to fly to get from place to place, it wasn’t solely for emergencies; during my teens into my twenties flying was all the rage. After that class I REALLY started to speak out and become active in supporting the climate. 
                                  <br><br>
 
The same year I took the climate crisis class was the 2020 presidential elections. I was very active in the elections, really speaking out about the importance of voting for a candidate that supported the green new deal. Bernie Sanders, a huge Green New Deal supporter was selected to be the democratic nominee. Unfortunately, Trump won the election, due to the stupid electoral college (thank god they got rid of that). 
                                  <br><br>
 
The next four years were rough politically. Trump continued to deny the climate crisis and refused to take action. Yet looking back Trump getting reelected may have been was the country needed. The young generation became more fired up than ever. Greta Thunberg led the way and we followed. We striked. We rose up. We became politically active. We were the change.
                                  <br><br>
 
Everyone was starting to feel the effects of climate change. My Child home burnt down, but honestly; I was just waiting for that day to come (although I wish I could take you back to it). There were tornadoes in California, Florida was getting submerged more and more underwater, and natural disaster after natural disaster. Everyone realized that we had to something so change that.
                                  <br><br>
 
In 2024 we finally got the white house back and elected our first WOMEN president, I thought I would never see that day. In the years 2020-2028 the public, republicans and liberals realized that Trump was the issue, and we started coming together as a country. The news stopped portraying things as a partisan issue and gave people the real facts. This helped immensely, because people were able to form their own opinions on political matters, and believe it or not people are inherently good and choose the morally good thing to do. 90% of people were behind the green new deal in the 2024 election. From the day the new democratic president stepped foot in the white house the Green New Deal hit the ground running. The US became unstoppable. 
                                  <br><br>
 
By 2030 the country was completely carbon neutral, all major oil companies were gone, we developed an intricate highspeed rail system so that we could travel efficiently and with low carbon footprint, and so much more. By this time, we were in the second term with the president Nakhiti, and onto part 2 of the Green New Deal. 
                                  <br><br>
 
Sweetie, I still remember the days and months after President Nakhiti got elected. Women were treated with the respect that they deserve. She was able to make peace with so many countries that Trump had severed relations with. She was emotional, captivating, and empathetic. I honestly believe that if we would have had a woman in office in the years before we could have made a change so much earlier. Women have this innate feeling of responsibility and taking care of everyone while simultaneously being the best person they can be. They are able put others needs in front themselves. Which was a stark contrast to Trump. A woman understands the importance of education about birth control for women AND men, so president Nakhiti was able to put a halt on population growth by educating less developed countries. 
                                  <br><br>
 
By 2040 things were starting to look up, the carbon in the atmosphere was diminishing. In the US the average carbon footprint was down to 2.5 tons a year, and we reached a point where the developed countries were able to help the developing countries develop in a sustainable manner, for example getting them electricity that was solar power run. I finally looked at the future and wasn’t scared for my child’s life. So I had you, and I felt so incredibly luck because I didn’t think that I would be able to have a kid. 
                                  <br><br>
 
By 2050 the heat trend finally took a slight turn down. We finally reached a place where we began to stable out. Wow it felt good. Thinking back to when I was your age, I didn’t think that this day would come. I didn’t think it was possible to have so much change. Change is really hard but once it becomes the new norm people can adapt and thrive. 
                                  <br><br>
 
Now looking at the life I live I could not be happier living in our tiny home in our complex with all our family friends, thinking if I choose to live anywhere else you would not have met Milley and Fern. Riding my bike to and from work every day is often the highlight of my day. I still can’t believe that our weeks used to be five days, I don’t think I could deal without my three-day weekends. Oh and did I mention when I was in college we always went to the grocery store and everything was wrapped in plastic. Oh and 30% of the population during my 20s was overweight, now that number has reduced to only 10%. I think that is due to everything switching to bulk, and people getting most of their food at the farmers market. 
                                  <br><br>
 
Sweetie I am so excited for your future and all you are going to accomplish. You can do whatever you set your mind to. If you believe in something speak out for it. Be active. Be strong. Be brave. You CAN make a change. Believe in yourself. You are amazing. Oh, and honey do everything you can to protect our beautiful earth. 
                                   <br><br>

I love you to the moon and back,                                   <br><br>

A message from the future;                                  <br><br>

It is now the year 2060, our carbon emissions are lower than ever. The planet is slowly going back to how it used to be before our industrialization of the world affected it. We have consistently been at the 1° Celcius mark since 2045. Everyone in the world has changed for the better. Car usage is almost non-existent, we have gone down to one car per family and public transportation is our primary source of transport, it is everywhere. The climate has improved substantially with the weather as well as nature improving. More people are out enjoying the beauty that has reemerged. However 40 year ago we had no idea what the future held for us. If we hadn’t done what we did it could have been catastrophic.
                                  <br><br>

In the year 2020, I took my first climate change class. In that class I first learned more about the crisis that was going on. Our planet was almost at a point of no return if we didn’t act quickly, it could have been the 6th mass extinction in history. In this same year Bernie Sanders was elected president of the United States, the younger generation did it. Although Sanders won, congress was divided and the Green New Deal was denied. People; especially the younger generations were mad about this. It was our future that was at stake and we needed to do everything we could to change this decision.
                                  <br><br>

In the year 2024, 4 years have passed since the climate riots broke out. After having gone out to protest for months the conclusion of the Deal, congress finally considered the Deal and ended up passing it. That was my first victory, I was part of that change and it just felt like the start of our new and improved world. However it took time to change and enact the ideas from the deal.
                                  <br><br>

In 2021 they began by changing the infrastructure of the country. We now have more bicycle lanes, more public transportation, and renewable infrastructures. People got on board with the bikes and public transportation was not being looked down upon anymore, it was becoming much normal for people to choose that rather than their own cars. The renewable infrastructures were the first step to changing the whole countries source of energy. 
                                  <br><br>

As we adjusted to those changes in the year 2022, livestock emissions were handled. This year was met with a lot of backlash, many of us have lived our whole lives as carnivores so it was hard for people to deal with the shortage of meat. In this same year because of this I decided to become a climatarian, it was actually much easier than expected and I was able to get my family on board with me. Apart from thinking about the planet, we feel much healthier and energized after this transition.
                                  <br><br>

In the year 2023 labor laws and job benefits were changed for the better. There were now better workplace environments as well as sustainable wages for people to live comfortably. Every job included health plans and paid vacations. This change boomed the economy, more people actually enjoyed going to work. Now in 2024, people are adjusting to the changes done in the last 4 years. Greenhouse emissions are beginning to get lowered.
                                  <br><br>

In 2030 we have continued to elect representatives that will continue supporting the changes that we are implementing to make sure we stay fossil fuel free. However we cannot control the world, there are still companies that use fossil fuel. For them, we have passed carbon fees, which help us to keep these companies in check as well as benefiting from them. At first people weren’t on board with this fee, but when they learned that we would be getting refund checks for emitting less carbon we got the support we needed to pass this law.
                                  <br><br>

In the year 2050 people have completely adjusted and gotten used to the improvements implemented years ago. Although we have changed a lot of things in the country the consumerism culture has been the hardest to get rid of. Fast fashion has decreased but there are still a couple companies that have been fortunate yet unfortunate to remain. However there are more climate friendly clothing shops that are also affordable that have emerged. We have come so far from where we began.

A letter to myself: It’s hard to say it, but we have failed to save the planet. Since the resource are depleted, earth is not habitable anymore. As you are reading this letter, the spaceship that carries the genes of existing species, which only a little, is wandering in the universe seeking the opportunity to rebuild the human culture. For me, as a human being, it’s time to accept the retribution of what entire specie have done. I don’t want to discourage you, but the fact is that people are selfish, especially those politicians who only consider the immediate loss and gains when we were facing the crisis that threaten the whole planet. We had a plan that could possibly save the future, but we wasted too much time to argue with each other instead of taking action. As a result, the rapid growth of population led to the food shortage, from the third countries then spread to developed countries. The starvation caused the worldwide uprising. The countries began to harvest scantly resources as more as possible, which caused the World War III. The war stimulated the powerful countries like Russian, US and China to spend more money on the military, which causes even more CO2 emission. When people are busy about keeping alive, no one cares about the climate change. However, they forget that even they survived the war, the climate change will erase almost all species on earth, which is we are facing now. I am really willing to spend the last few minutes of my life to describe the earth we have now. Why don’t we start from the collage life? Remember where you took the collage? The beautiful Santa Barbara had covered by ocean just at the beginning of the war. In fact, one-third of land is under water, and if we count the place that is too hot to live, only one-fourth of world land can potentially support species like us with the accompany of extreme weather. I know you are very confused right now. “What about the green new deal?” It’s really sad that the education couldn’t be popularized before the war. As a result, only a small group of educated people have the sight to predict the future with climate change and tried to make some change. But that’s was far from enough to attract people’s attention from the border issues or oil crisis. Admittedly, some people are motivated by many environmentalists to live a more environmental-sustainable life, but all those efforts were cancelled off because of the war and many other factors. For example, the wealth was still concentrated in the top 5 percent population, who flied a lot regardless the climate change. There are too many stupid things we had done. For your generation, you still have time to change, please don’t make the mistakes tha………………………………

To my younger self, everything you learned about to some extent in Climate Crisis 101 turned out to be prophetic. In the year 2060, a lot has changed. While in 2020 consumer culture and the overuse of fossil fuels was rampant, in 2060, the world is running on minimalist culture and completely renewable energy. You might wonder how in the span of forty years the planet changed so dramatically. The answer is that the consequences of climate change had become so apparent by 2040 that action had to be taken, or the inevitable extinction of our species would arrive much sooner. 
                                  <br><br>
The truth of the matter is that the planet is in really bad shape. Sea levels did rise, cities like New Orleans and Venice are completely under water. Climate refugees arrived in the United States in droves in the 2030s because of it. Ecological diversity is practically non-existent, and our forests were bare about a decade ago. I hate to say it, but the world did not start taking action until the effects of climate change could no longer be ignored. In 2040, we finally elected our first female president, from the Green Party no less and that was the turning point in climate policy. She outright banned the use of fossil fuels, shut down all fracking in the United States, and put in place a plan similar to the Green New Deal that would overhaul the fossil fuel economy and replace it with a renewable one. Not longer after our Green New Deal was put in place, other countries started following suit. 
                                  <br><br>
In addition to creating a green plenitude economy, people started trying to reverse the effects of climate change as best they could. People started mass planting trees to repopulate our forests, started replenishing fish populations in lakes and oceans, and started developing technology to reverse ocean acidification and air pollution. So far, there has been some progress, but there is a lot of damage to reverse. On a lifestyle level, the meat industry is practically non-existent. Almost all people now follow a plant based, freegan diet, the only animal products people use are the ones they produce themselves in their backyards or on family farms. You can’t imagine how hard this was to implement. In substitution for meat, technology has advanced to make soy and gluten proteins taste exactly like meat. The United States has also enacted a tax law that incentivizes families to follow a two-child policy. With the high level of education and access to contraceptives in this country, this was a reasonable transition and an economically appealing one for many families as well. The good news is that you have two children and four grandchildren already and that way your family is following the replacement rate. 
                                  <br><br>
Ultimately, there have many changes in the past forty years, but you’ll find that even though there has been a lot of tragedy and hardship, there is some glimmer of hope for the future, no matter how much we’ve messed up.

My dear baby, 
                                  <br><br>

In the year 2016, I was first exposed to the climate crisis. Just like you, I was in high school, anxiously questioning what my future will look like: What will my career be? How will I make a positive change in the world? What will I have to change in my life to achieve my goals? Simultaneously, I was reflecting on my personal decisions as well as my interests and my perceptions on the world. My marine biology and environmental science teacher was one of the first people to point me in the right direction; she was enthusiastic, strong-willed, kind-hearted, and very knowledgeable on the devastating problems our planet was facing at the time. As I learned more about the science behind climate change, I was eager to understand how these problems affect us personally and collectively. 
                                  <br><br>

Before I started my first year at UCSB, I immersed myself into my passion of writing by becoming an activist writer for an online magazine called Lune. I fell in love with the work I did because I could finally write about what I was passionate about: social and environmental justice. From then on, I made that my career goal: to write about environmental justice that affects the poorest in our country. At twenty-four years old, I became an environmental consultant, where I observe the planning of poor, suburban cities in the County of Los Angeles and the effects of city decisions on resource accessibility and health exposure. 
                                  <br><br>

When I took up this job and began to live in the middle of LA, I immediately noticed certain aspects of my life that were contributing to the climate crisis, so I remembered a class I took in college called “The Climate Crisis 101” where my professor outlined specific ways that we can personally contribute to mitigating climate change. Instead of buying my own work, I walked or took the bus to work, I fully committed to eating as a climatarian, and continued to actively be involved in my decisions of choosing what to (not) buy.
                                  <br><br>

Over the many years at my job, we worked with the many departments of LA County to construct infrastructure that would promote the use of safer, cheaper, and more accessible transportation systems in poorer communities. We planned for the long-term relocation of waste facilities that have disproportionately altered the health of the people living in these communities for decades and promoted free public access to composting and recycling methods. Although we still have so much work to do, I am proud of the small progress we have made in emphasizing the deeply institutional problems faced by minority neighborhoods. 
                                  <br><br>

But why would I choose this life? Ultimately, I did it all for you. In making decisions about my career path and my personal life, I was always thinking of you and the type of world that you will grow up in. I wanted to secure a future for you that I was uncertain about, but I ultimately knew this would begin with how I chose to live my own life. And, so, my hope is that you too will take up the responsibility of protecting our planet for the futures of yourself and your children, in whatever ways you can.
                                  <br><br>

With love,                                  <br><br>

Hello...Can you read me?... Is this working?... Ok, there it is.
                                  <br><br>


If you happen to get this message... we failed. Badly. We knew that we were wrong, but we just did not want to be right.
                                  <br><br>
Now we are suffering the consequences of our actions...
                                  <br><br>
At its current state, the planet that used to be the Earth has been deemed inhabitable as the air became too toxic to breathe and water sources are too acidic to be consumed. Radiation is becoming much more of an issue than it has been. The only civilized cities left are Finland and Denmark, and even they are suffering. All the wealthy class have moved there, and have monopolized their wealth to stock up as many food products from the world as possible. It is the only place left where humans could exist. The rest of the world, unfortunately, was cast out of this city and either died or turned into savages, wandering the wasteland that used to be blue and green. How did it get this bad? Well, it started with the turn of the decade, the Declining '20s.
                                  <br><br>
With the 2020's Presidential Election, the Incumbent President Donald Trump maintained the White House. Afraid of another uprising like the Presidential nominee,  Bernie Sanders, President Trump pushed a Law to end all conservations and climate research. He thought that such "useless conservation" would hinder the American Progress and in turn, we would lose our GDPs to our competitors. At first, this was met with huge uprisings from the people, but giants like Exxon and the Koch Brothers immediately formed lobby groups to both buy congress and the people of America. The Meat industry also joined the pack, as well, for it could mean that they can cut down more forests to raise livestock. Very soon after, the relationship between these anti-climate groups got very close, dangerously close.
                                  <br><br>
And the Congressional election close in, these anti-climate groups formed Super-Pacs to endorse even more Republican seats in Congress, turning both the White House and the Legislative Branch Red. They took advantage of the fact that the majority of the Youth do not vote, and thus gained much more power by influencing the older generations, the generation that does not believe in climate change. President Trump, still unhappy with his lack of growth, used Congress' war declaring power to declare war over South America for its resources. It was a success, and very soon after, the Amazon forest became a palm oil forest;  and the people of South America became new American wage workers. With such a big influx of workers, labor laws had to be abolished so that everyone could still have a Job, despite the ridiculously low wage. Sweatshops in countries like India became more obsolete as cheap labor can now be found on U.S soil.  The Rich of American became richer, and the poor became much poorer.
                                  <br><br>
India, with their income and influence from the West gone, got more desperate for wealth. They then had no choice but to dig from their coal reservoirs. From such a big power supply, India rapidly industrialized,  even to the point of beating some first world countries in GDPs; but the air above them soon became black and cloudy, and soon it was transparent that it was becoming inhabitable. Crops would no longer grow on just filthy soil and dirty air. Many Indians sought refuge in other countries, but the Indian Government, copying the U.S, wanted to start a War over the other nations for resources. They then invaded their neighboring countries for land expansion.
                                  <br><br>
The United States, being the policeman of the world, intervened. It was a long war, with heavy casualties on both sides. Finally having enough, the U.S regretfully used the Nuclear Option. India,  on the other hand,  after hearing the news from one of their spies, proceeded to do the same. 2 nuclear warheads were dropped on the same day.
                                  <br><br>
People who were in either of those countries died instantly, and the radiation from the bombs was extreme enough to spread to their neighbors. The 30s' were a time of mass hysteria, where men fought only for themselves. The rich, due to the wealth that they have accumulated from all the consumerism in the 20s', have found themselves a safe haven in Finland and Denmark,  where the grass was still green. The rest of the 99%, however, were not so fortunate and had to live in the inhabitable wasteland. 
                                  <br><br>
This is where we are right now.
                                  <br><br>
I know you will not be able to understand this for a while, but this is how it went wrong. I beg that you will learn from this and will never, ever, let an event like this happen again.
                                  <br><br>
Your mother and I also want to give you our most sincere apology for not being able to go with you on your journey, but even with every penny that we were able to save up, we could only get one ticket to Mars... And with our social status now, we will most likely get thrown out with the Savages. But it is worth it because I know that you can change the world, you will be the change. 
                                  <br><br>
Let our failure be a lesson. Make me proud...
                                  <br><br>

To My Future Self, 


                                  <br><br>

As you sat in lecture in the year 2020, you were proud that the personal changes you had made for a better lifestyle were ways that contributed to better the climate crisis. You were eager to share the new information you had learned through lectures, reading, and films with your friends and family. The real question now is, have you continued to stick with your lifestyle that benefited our planet? Have you allowed yourself to adapt to other cultural changes for a better future and the life of your children? What does the world look like to you now, in the year 2060? 
                                  <br><br>

Being a lover of the fashion industry and practicing minimalism was difficult. Of course, you weren’t able to carry all your belongings in a single suitcase, but you made the effort to not buy into the consumer culture. You talked to your friends about how much easier it would be to adapt to minimalism if everyone else around you practiced it as well. You had the desire to live a simple life and the courage to adapt to a different lifestyle that would help reduce personal CO2 emissions. This clutter free, healthy, and nature-oriented lifestyle appealed to you. Did you buy into the American culture when you began your career? Did you begin to focus on what you were earning rather than your happiness? I am worried that you gave everything up because you did not see the positive impact on the earth and in yourself. 
                                  <br><br>

If you successfully stayed on track and the community of activists grew in your society, what does the world look like now, In the year 2060? Let me tell you what I imagine our society to be like. Our homes would have our basic necessities and new sources of energy will have replaced the old, our communities are now aware on the importance of assisting one another, etc. My main concern is that of our diet. Have many switched to a plant-based diet and realized that letting go of meat is better for our environment and health? Or are many still in denial of all cultural changes that have been suggested? 
                                  <br><br>

I hope you have not fallen off track! You always talked about the importance of personal commitment and emphasized that change is possible. You were and I hope you continued to be motivated by the determination to create and live in a better future! May you have succeeded by keeping yourself and future generations in mind. 
                                  <br><br>

Sincerely, 
                                   <br><br>

Hello person in 2060
                                   <br><br>


I don’t know exactly what I want to address first but I guess it would be good to address what’s going on right now in 2020. You know I’ve been hearing about this climate crisis for quite some time know. Pretty much my whole life. There was always those Disney commercials that had the newest stars advocate for sustainability because we only had on earth and we needed to take care of it. It seemed like a pressing issue to me as kid so you’d think that by the time I’d reach adulthood that everything would have been taken care of. Things don’t always go as they should though. It’s been almost 20 years and for some reason it’s seems as though we’ve taken some steps back. I remember combating climate change as being something that we could all rally behind but for whatever reason it’s become such a partisan issue. We had leaders in this country talk of hope and change for years and years but never making substantial change. And then a hopeful leader promising to continue the legacy of previous leaders only to be bested by the guy from the “apprentice”. Since 2016 it almost as though we’ve entered this bizarro world. It is almost as though the the United States has been unmasked for what it really is. At least that’s what’s it been like for me. We’ve had global crisis like a world war scare. Epidemics like the corona virus plaguing the worlds. And of course we can’t forget about the climate crisis. The world is pretty hectic. I might end up getting my degree through the internet’s it corona gets any worse. The last four years have been  really an awakening for me. It a period in my life in which I realized that something was wrong. That everything I’ve learned was a lie. That right always triumphs over good and that if we all work hard enough we can all achieve our dreams. I’ve learned a lot these past four years but the climate crisis has always been something frustrating to learn about. I never realized how much of an impact my lifestyle had on the planet becuase it’s all I’ve known and it’s what I assumed most people lived like. But I’ve been privileged all my life. And someone who is privileged never notices their privilege. And even if they do they have the privilege to ignore it. But I’ve seen the damage that dismissing the single greatest threat to humanity has caused and I think the age of ignoring has to come to an end. Our house is on fire and time we get angry about it. For many this phrase is literal. Australia’s bush fires were only made worse by climate change. The fires like the one In paradise and all over California have only been made worse by climate change. The death and extinction of many animals around this world have been a result of humans and their climate change. The suffering of poor people around the world is only heightened by climate change. The generation before us has ignored suffering and I’m confident that our generation will actively pay attention. I am responsible for my own actions. I will adopt a diet that takes the climate into consideration. I will dress and buy with the climate in mind. I will do my best to take transportation that takes the climate into consideration. Let’s forget about flying altogether. I can wait to explore the world because there might not be one to explore if people live the way they do today. You know it irks me that coronavirus has gotten all this outrage. Don’t get me wrong it’s a serious issue that needs to be addressed. But the climate crisis has killed and harmed more people than corona will ever (knock on wood, maybe you can tell me how this goes down or maybe not). The climate crisis has done more damage but it doesn’t get the same energy. I mean sure a virus that kills everyone on earth sure gets everyone’s and media’s imagination going. But I think a key factor is that corona virus really goes after everyone. The climate crisis does not. The United States hates poor people enough to continue their suffering. I mean the whole premise of our country is that it can wash your poorness away. That one day you can live the lifestyle that consumes all. And it’s this lifestyle that has gotten us to where we are now. If I ask of one thing for the world to do it’s to be more considerate. Something that’s very important here in the United States is for everyone to be mindful of the impact that their lives have on the other and the environment. We live and yearn for opulence but is opulence really satisfying enough to destroy the world for. I want everyone in the country to truly ask themselves what they want their purpose in life to be. Then ask themselves after that if their dream is manufactured by society or something that truly makes them happy. I’m confident that my generation can do this. But unfortunately it’s going to take more than my generation to solve this. And I’m just not so sure that the older generation can begin to pay attention. The reality is that they have the privilege to ignore it all. So I begin wonder if that change they continue to talk about will ever happen. Did it?

To my future self,
                                   <br><br>

It is the year 2060 and by now you will have had three times the life experience than I do today. Hopefully, life has brought you to where you want to be and you are surrounded by friends and family that add fulfillment to your life. In the year 2020, you decided to take a climate crisis course during your time at UC Santa Barbara, and your eyes were opened to the endless environmental injustices in our world and the possible doom of our planet. It was this year, that you decided to live more environmentally consciously.
                                   <br><br>

In the year 2015, you decided to take up a plant-based diet. As I am writing this, you have been going 5 years strong. And with my utmost confidence I can say that as you are reading this, you have been going 45 years strong. From an early age, you have understood the power you hold in the control that you have over what you put on your plate, and what you put in your body. I hope that you instill these values in your children. I hope that you will have raised your child(ren) to be climatarians and to understand how important an issue food waste and food insecurity is. In the year 2020, 40% of all food is wasted by human hands. In the year 2060, I hope that his number has significantly decreased and that people have begun to live with more awareness and thought to what they buy, eat, and throw away. I hope that American culture shuns those who waste food and look down on those who buy more than they need.
                                   <br><br>

In the year 2060, I hope that you are living a lifestyle that is considerate of the wellness of our planet and the living circumstances of others on the planet who are less fortunate. I hope that you no longer purchase from fast fashion industries as you were made aware in the year 2020 of the terrible working conditions these laborers must endure in order for you to buy a top with a cheap price tag. I hope you discouraged your friends from buying from these industries and I hope you made an effort to shift their mindsets into a more environmentally conscious one.
                                   <br><br>

Most of all, I hope that you are seeking happiness in the right places. I hope that you are searching for human connection, self understanding, and real-life fulfillment. I hope you value the time that you have on this planet and help others to realize their privilege and the honor that they have to be spending time on this earth. I hope that you don’t fall into materialism and that you remain grounded in your values and your life philosophies. I know that you will not forget what brings value to your life and how deceiving other things can be when it comes to adding to that value. Never forget that these unfulfilling things we choose to let control us and our lifestyles are not only detrimental to our mental health and overall wellbeing, but they can be damaging to our environment and people around the world who are less fortunate.

Imagine if the time goes to 2060, the level of human civilization and science and technology of water products will reach an unprecedented height, and we will start to do something we dare not even think about now. For example, when we join in, our exploration will be beyond the earth, and we will start to build colonies on the moon and Mars. This is just the beginning, because human beings are trying to use the energy of our solar system, the energy of the universe, and the earth may be overwhelmed by the burden, and we have reached the universe with our own super high technology. Then human nature may be It's very interesting and subtle. So far, I don't think we have the ability to deal with some of the most relevant and specific problems when we explore the most fuzzy areas in our reality for all our wisdom and applications, even though some things have brought a lot of adverse effects. We don't have the ability to look to the future. Our generation looks at polar bears, penguins and pandas, which are endangered animals, and feels very rare. But it's likely that in a few decades, when animals like penguins, polar bears and pandas die out, our children and grandchildren will be able to see them just as we see dinosaur skeletons in museums. Originally, the colorful world, the diverse world will become more and more gray and simple, which is not what we expect. We always pay attention to the personal enjoyment at present, but we don't really see the essence of things. I believe that if one day we are really punished by the earth and the environment, we will regret it, and this is irreversible, just like the death of dinosaurs, and human beings will eventually go to their own end.
                                    <br><br>
I want to say to myself in 2060 that at this time, whether you are rich or poor, successful or unsuccessful, if there is no accident, you should be an old man, and you should have your own family, and you should even have grandchildren. You should remember that you took a class on environmental protection when you were 20 years old, and you declared in every assignment that you would do your best to protect the environment and affect the people around you to protect the environment. Please take a look at the world and your family and friends. Have you done it? How much influence did your efforts bring or did you forget your original promise at all! A person's life is only a few decades, just like a grain of sand in human history. But now there are seven billion grains of sand in the world. It's not just a grain of sand. It's a desert. We certainly don't want our world to become a desert. Then we must strive to become a green leaf, so that the world is full of seven billion green leaves, full of vitality and hope. At that time, our children and grandchildren will see lovely and wonderful animals in the zoo, we will have wonderful scenery waiting for us to explore with our whole life, and we will have a happy life under the blue sky in California as we do now. I want to say to myself, come on!

To my future kids, I hope by the time you're reading this the climate crisis is no longer a crisis. I hope my actions, your grandparent's actions and ultimately everyone on this planet could have made a difference for a better future for you. I first learned the extremity of the climate crisis when I enrolled in a class about it in my undergrad years at UCSB. Little did I know that that class would shape my lifestyle from thereon. It was scary learning about the consequences that our actions could have if we did not act like rising temperatures and food famines. And it was disappointing to learn that where I was born and raised, America, was leading in fossil fuels and CO2 production. As soon as I learned how detrimental CO2 was to our environment I vowed to lower my consumption dramatically. The first thing I changed in my life was my diet. I went vegan for the most part but I went by what was called climatrianism. I ate for the climate crisis which meant things that were locally in season and good for the environment. I like to believe that this was a largely beneficial change as for myself and our family were largely meat-eaters. And with every chance I had I tried to explain to other people how I ate in hopes that they would see the perks of it and try it themselves. I am so proud to say that that is why your family eats this way now. These are values I am proud to have given you. My next change was trying to be as zero waste as possible. While this was largely in food (my trader joe grocery trips were very much limited), I made most of my lifestyle zero waste. Every time I purchased an item I made sure it was reusable or 100% recyclable. As well as I looked into what these companies were and who they funded. Making sure my money does not go to big corporations that fund companies that emit fossil fuels. Another big change I made was my voice in political actions. While I always knew the impact of voting and being politically involved I never used it to my advantage until I took that climate crisis class. Since then I have been voting into office who will be best for this environment, who will actually take action, and deals like the new green deal which makes a change in regard to climate crisis. And when you come of legal voting age I encourage you to do the same, as your voice most certainly matters. Lastly, what I think to have been the hardest change for myself was giving up the majority of car use. In my time Cars were used by everyone and everyone owned one. It was about convenience and luxury. It was something I thought I could not go without. But nonetheless, i proved myself wrong. While it was a difficult transition, I was able to do it. What made it possible was the adaptation to public transportation the state made. It became easier and more convenient for people to use public transportation. I sincerely hope that by the time you are grown the climate crisis is no longer a crisis. While I know that myself and our close family had made transitions I am hoping the rest of the country- even the world- gets their stuff together and helps the planet. I hope you, my children adapt to this better lifestyle and I hope you guys are willing to fight for the change you want to see just as I did.  As I did this for you, the future generations.

A message from my future self:

                                   <br><br>

First and foremost, I want to congratulate myself on being able survive for 40 more years. I’m glad that I’m alive and well, and much happier than I thought I would ever be.
                                   <br><br>
Past self,  I’m glad you took that class back in 2020, Climate Change 101. You learned so much, not only about society/ past generations’s collective contribution to the climate crisis, but for how your own actions were contributing so much to the destruction of the planet.  
                                   <br><br>
I remember how you were so stressed about the final, only for it to be cancelled over covid-19. Ironically, the spread of infectious disease is increased with densely populated areas, a cause of population spurge, which is the top contributing factor to the climate crisis. That decade, I know you and those around you were contemplating the recent fires in the Santa Barbara area and how there seemed to be way more natural disasters, many which affected your friends personally, including that one RA that lost her home in the Paradise fires. Also, how are those conversations between you and your roommates about how the weather seemed to be “freakish,” swinging from randomly warm hours in February to heavy cold nights? Yep, those are all effects of the climate crisis happening right before your eyes. Yet, the political culture around you remained indifferent. Recently, the 2020 primary elections happened. You and all your college friends voted eagerly for Bernie Sanders, supporter of the Green New Deal and advocate for progressive, radical change. Yet, the majority of people favored “moderate” candidate Joe Biden. Now, nothing really changed in the forty years since. By 2060, the majority of Europe and Canada ran on renewable energy, and countries like China and India began implementing their own green policies. Yet, the US continued acting with their best interest in mind, and the rich corporations stayed in power.

After taking Climate Crisis 101 at UCSB, I took steps so that I could fight against climate change and create a better world for myself and for the future generations. I had learned briefly about climate change and CO2 warming the planet in high school classes but I had never taken a class so in depth about the issue and came out with so many ways to be kinder to the Earth that I lived in and I was equipped with the tools to teach others how to fight against climate change and help restore our planet. 

                                   <br><br>

In the following election year, we went out and voted in numbers that were not seen before. It was time for the young people to realize that no one was going to save us from the future except for ourselves. In countries all over, politicians advocating for climate change policies were elected. The change in power was monumental and allowed many new policies to be passed and acted upon. Over the course of 40 years, the world was able to switch completely from fossil fuels to renewable energy. High speed electric railroad systems were built in the United States, allowing for fast travel across the country. Domestic flight travel was no longer necessary as trains were almost as fast as planes, were financially available to all people, and were run efficiently. International flights still existed but people only flew for family emergencies and for rare once in a lifetime vacations. Throughout a majority of cities, public transport was revamped and put as high priority for funding. This allowed workers to travel to work without emitting as much carbon as they would by car and designated biking lanes were created to increase biking traffic in cities. 

                                   <br><br>

Once those in power were able to enact climate change policies, disinformation and fake science created by the oil industry was criminalized and the population realized the truth about climate change and voted in favor of the Green New Deal and similar policies in other countries. Coal workers and other oil industry workers were placed in the construction and maintenance of new renewable energy sources. With the improvement of transportation in cities, car ownership decreased as more people took advantage of the cheap public transportation available to them. It took a long time for these changes to happen, but with the help of educated people finding effective ways to communicate to deniers, more and more people were able to see what needed to be changed in order to protect our planet and the wildlife living in it. The ice caps no longer melted and sea levels did not rise. Freak weather events decreased and the less fortunate were exposed less to the consequences of climate change. 
                                   <br><br>


There are always more things that we can do to combat climate change, but now that the world knows that this issue is important and something that the people want to fight for, it is looking good for the future. It sucks that it took so long before we were able to fight against climate change but it's better now than never.

<p>
In a message from me in 2060 to me in the present. We are actually living in a sustainable world now. Things that were thought of as impossible eventually passed through both the government as well as the culture here in the United States. Cars are a thing of the past with public transportation being faster, cheaper, and just as convenient because of the infrastructure put in place. We have high speed trains connecting all major cities as well as efficient buses, trains, and electric bikes in all cities as well. With a priority put on public transportation similar to the case in Puerto Rico, it just did not make sense for people to waste their money on a car anymore. This has halted the domestic flight industry because these high speed trains are competitive in time and pricing while being immensely better for the environment. Sadly, there is still no way of crossing oceans without flying so that is still around, though new technology has significantly reduced the emissions of these flights. We also passed the Green New Deal as a bill with the proper enforcement to ensure the goals of the bill. With that fossil fuel companies had to either close or shift their business model in which a large amount actually did. Almost every location in the US has access to at least one type of renewable energy, being solar, wind, hydro, or geothermal with the other places having safe nuclear power, so this is now the major source of our energy. More on the combination of the governmental and culture change was the meat industry. Many animal production companies closed as they could not keep up with the emission regulations combined with a lesser demand. But technology which has been around since 2020 became more mainstream and it is normal now to have beef flavored 3-D printed meat. There is still real meat around but it is now more expensive and in much lower supply. 
                                   <br><br>
All this change did not come easily or fast unfortunately. Even after knowing of these problems very clearly since the year 2020, it still took 12 years for changes in government policies due to a lack of majority of true climate change activists in power. The year 2032 was the year when we finally elected a president that prioritized climate change with a supporting congress and senate. By this time there was already irreparable damage done such as hundreds of more species going extinct, flooding around the world causing billions of dollars of damage, and people dying around the world. But now in 2060, things are looking better, the Earth has started to heal with the carbon in the atmosphere decreasing for the first time in over a century and temperatures normalizing to before the 2000s. We did it.

Forty years from now, 
                                   <br><br>

I have so many expectations for you in 2060. I EXPECT nothing less than success, a stable and good career (hopefully in the medical field), and a stable life with lots of friends, a well suitable spouse, maybe kids (? but most likely not haha).
                                   <br><br>

I can easily visualize or fantasize about my future as a 19-year-old college student with big aspirations and an open mind but I cannot bring myself to visualize the future of the earth. In one daydream I can see: bright, sunny skies with hundreds of birds flying through the air, people living their lives but with happiness (big smiles on everyone’s faces), and everything from the air to the cement that I am standing on feels clean, this is the American Dream. In another daydream, I can also see: dark, cloudy skies with disgusting smog floating in the atmosphere, people choose not to roam outdoors and everyone is depressed, everything feels dirty and life is not worth living in America or anywhere at all. 
                                   <br><br>

While I will never know what the future will look like forty years from now, it scares me as of right now that my expectations of the world in the future are unclear. 
                                   <br><br>

You may not remember this class that you took your first year at UCSB, English 23. You initially chose this class on GOLD (hopefully you recognize this) because the class was not full yet and you needed the units and the credits that it came with. You only chose this class because it looked SO easy to blow off and do nothing in; it had only three lectures a week with no section. Your best friend from home and your new college friend that you made also were taking this class and you thought it would be fun. You took this class not expecting to learn so much about the world in 10 weeks than in high school AP Environmental Science for a whole year (you probably won’t remember this either). I learned so much about the climate crisis and what we, as privileged Americans, are doing to the earth. Right now, it seems as if there is no hope for reversing the damage already caused by greedy corporate America and right now our government thinks that climate change is a hoax made by “apocalyptic, alarmist Democrats” who are “destroying the government”. People are so against AOC’s Green New Deal because we do not know what to expect, it’s too “radical”. You learned that the actions that Americans make have consequences, except it affects the 99% in the world, those who have nothing compared to you and those who live in third world countries. You learned about fast fashion and how that industry alone has partially destroyed the world, you learned about ways to reduce your carbon footprint through different peoples and scientists, you learned about so much. This class got you not eating meat again, it encouraged you to live in smaller spaces in urban cities, it allowed you to see the daily life that you were so used to in another perspective. You learned that one small action can blossom into something bigger. This class laid a philosophical foundation in your life.
                                   <br><br>

Hopefully, in 2060, the House and the Senate are run by Democrats who are fighting to protect humanity against our house wrecking on top of us. Hopefully, in 2060, America is run by leaders who have a strict agenda they follow that is meant to help humanity from experiencing devastating consequences of climate change. Hopefully, you, me in 40 years, can be an example to my community as a happy content person by adopting the climatarian lifestyle. Hopefully, in 2060, I am still alive and thriving in America or another country. 
                                   <br><br>

As a 19-year-old first year college student at UCSB, I hope that you eventually break out of your comfort zone and get involved with climate activism. I hope that you are constantly reminded of your contributions to the expanding greenhouse emissions and your carbon footprint. I hope that you continue to execute the list of 20 things that you can do to reduce your carbon footprint, a list composed by your UCSB Climate Crisis 101 professor and iconic boomer legend in your life, Ken Hiltner. 
                                   <br><br>

There is a lot of hope in my heart and I really am hopeful of our generation working together to restore the earth back together. Maybe this is something that brings Americans together? Only you would know, you have lived this long.
                                   <br><br>

Part of me is very excited to see my life forty years from now. Maybe I will live to be forty years more older than now and maybe I won’t. Regardless, whatever I do in my lifetime, I hope that it helps the earth and brings restoration to our home.

Dear kids, 
                                   <br><br>

It’s July 11, 2060 and I’m happily celebrating my 60th birthday, something my younger self  thought would never happen. When I was a teenager, I was petrified about climate change and its threat against the existence of humanity. However, I was even more exasperated and enraged that nothing was being done to fight it. I was angry that the generation before me knew about the horrific consequences of climate change and yet they only fueled the issue rather than working together to find solutions.
                                   <br><br>

By the time I was 19, I was a sophomore at UCSB and in the winter 2020 quarter my eyes were opened. I took English 23 (Climate Crisis 101) a class I decided to take because I was tired and frustrated for not being able to do much to help our planet and I wanted to learn what I could do. Let me just say that it was one of the best classes I ever took! The professor who taught the class, Ken Hitlner, was passionate about this topic and was always very optimistic about our future, which made me hopefully too. Going into this class I already knew about sea-level rise, the unnatural density of wildfires, extinction of species, mind-boggling emissions of CO2, and the exploitation of earth’s natural resources. However, little did I know that those were only the basics.  
                                   <br><br>

At the time, the U.S. made up 4% of the world’s population, yet a quarter of the CO2 that was trapped in the atmosphere came from the U.S, Australia went through the most devastating wildfire in history in 2019 - 4x bigger than the biggest 15 fires of my home state California - and Bangladesh workers that made clothes for the fast fashion in wealthy countries were being treated inhumane. With such unfortunate events going on at the same time, I learned that you can make a change one step at a time, day by day. Professor Ken offered 20 solutions that are plausible to achieve. Even though I started off slowly, I was able to successfully implement many of these solutions throughout my life up till now. 
                                   <br><br>

When I was in high school I wanted to transition to a plant-based diet because I didn’t want animals to suffer and I wanted to help the environment as well. Although I definitely failed to do this transition in high school, I did try again when I was taking English 23. I started off by not eating meat on Mondays and eventually I realized that I felt much better on days that I didn’t eat meat. So I slowly transitioned completely to a plant-based diet and I haven’t regret this decision once ever since. At the beginning it was really hard to maintain this diet since you kids already know how our culture is meat fanatic, but it’s all in the willpower and how much you really want something. Secondly, I mainly used a bike to get around rather than using a car. Remember kids, it’s wise to live close by work so you can either walk, bike, or even jog to work and cut your carbon emission footprint. Yes, I admit that I owned a car throughout my life but it was only used for emergencies. Other than that it has been really easy to get around on bikes ever since the Green New Deal was passed in 2021. Everyone, mostly my generation, started to use their bikes more than their cars and it made me feel like I wasn’t alone in this, people were really trying to make a change. This would explain why we have smaller homes, micro-apartments, and co-housing compared to 40 years ago. I bought my first micro-apartment when I was 26 and by doing this, minimalism became an effortless action. By buying only what I needed or what would help me, brought such satisfaction and happiness to my life because when we choose to not buy something we’re voting with our pockets. Voting that a product shouldn’t be produced, which then would help reduce the exploitation of natural resources.
                                   <br><br>

Talking about voting, voting percentages among my generation increased dramatically since the primary election of 2020 and ever since then we’ve been the group that votes the most. Bernie Sanders won the Presidential Election on Tuesday, November 3, 2020 and helped us move forward to saving our planet. The Green New Deal was passed under his term, a carbon tax was executed in 2021 and immediately one was able to see a decrease in car usage, airplane travel, and an increase in public transportation. Of course baby boomers were angry that Bernie won the election, but he was the change that the world needed. Ever since Bernie was president, the following presidents followed his stance on protecting earth. Our planet was sitting on a ticking bomb and if we didn’t act immediately, you and I wouldn’t be here in the first place. Compared to how climate change was 40 years ago, this planet is now close to clean. Obviously there’s still work to get done, however this is where you guys lead the way now. Kiddos, you have to be the change you want to see. I hope that by explaining what I did in my youth in trying to protect our planet, inspired you two to also fight for it in your own ways. At the end of the day I’m proud of y’all and I know this planet is in good hands. 
                                   <br><br>

All the love,
                                   <br><br>

Mom 
                                   <br><br>

P.S. I’m glad I’m celebrating my 60th birthday! I thought the extreme life crisis that happened throughout my life such as the San Andreas Earthquake, WWIII threats, coronavirus, heavy snow in LA were going to end us all. However, here we are and for that it’s time to celebrate!

Hello. I am here to tell you about the future. Luckily, we acted and were able to mitigate the climate crisis… for the time being. It is 2060, and I am telling you, the people of 2020, what we did to help slow the climate crisis and what I wish we did better. 
                                   <br><br>

In 2020, the world was at its tipping point. The world had experienced record temperatures, freak weather occurrences, and many other awful things. My generation knew that we needed to solve the climate crisis, or we would no longer have a sustainable earth to call our homes. At the time, I was 18. People that seemed to care about the climate crisis were around my age to a bit older. It was clear that the climate fight was one for the younger generations. We all decided to act. 2020 was the year that we passed the Green New Deal, not in the way you would think, though. 
                                   <br><br>

In the 2020 presidential election, Biden was projected to win the democratic nomination. However, with the freak coronavirus outbreak, things went haywire. Trump and his entire administration got coronavirus, and so did Biden and his team. The only plausible choice was to make Bernie president, effective immediately. Bernie became the 46th president of the United States, and moved into the white house right away.
                                   <br><br>

There was no time to waste. The Green New Deal was immediately started. First, there was a massive worldwide carbon tax enacted. This lead to the steep decrease of the manufacturing of vehicles, especially nonelectric. Fracking was outlawed, and the use of oil to power machines virtually stopped. Within a few years, our energy use was transformed entirely into renewable energy. 
                                   <br><br>

Women received proper education and access to contraception, so naturally the birth rate decreased exponentially. The population stayed stagnant at almost 8 billion for the first few years of Bernie’s presidency, and then overtime slowly decreased to 6 billion, the world’s current population in 2060. This population is still very high, and housing adjusted completely to account for this. The majority of people live in co-housing communities or micro-apartments. 
                                   <br><br>

The commercial production of beef was outlawed. If people wanted to eat beef, which the majority did not, they would have to raise their own cow (which not many people wanted to do.) Huge amounts of water, land, and resources were saved because they were not being used for the beef industry. Also, the larger the environmental impact of the food had, in production and transportation, correlated directly to the cost. Thus, locally grown produce was very cheap and affordable. This promoted the more sustainable way of shopping and living. People no longer wanted to eat the fruits imported from continents away when they could grow them in their backyard. These changes were not only adopted in the nation, but worldwide.
                                   <br><br>

Finally, in order to fly, one had to obtain a flying permit. This flying permit, aside from being very expensive, required that the flyer had a valid reason to use air travel. These permits were very rare. The most common way of long distance travel was train, or high speed rail. In 2020, the construction began of train lines all across the world. Bernie input a high speed rail reaching all across the United States, and other nations followed suit. Now, in 2060, we have developed and are testing electric planes that do not use a lot of energy to manufacture.
                                   <br><br>

The United States finally was able to rise up and play our part in the global fight against the climate crisis. Now, I will look at what I and many others did personally to help mitigate the climate crisis. I became vegan right away. I decided to use biking as my main source of transportation. I decided that I would not fly unless absolutely necessary. And, I lived a minimalist lifestyle. I was given the opportunity to learn about all of these and understand their impacts thanks to my class at UCSB, Climate Crisis 101. 
                                   <br><br>

However, this cannot be said for everyone. Sadly, a good amount of people decided that they needed to keep their mansions and continue to live with endless amounts of stuff. I wish that we could have tried harder to stop this, but the climate crisis was mitigated either way. Now, we are working on new technology to make our way of life greener and footprint smaller than ever. We still need to 
                                   <br><br>

In 2020, we knew what could happen to the planet. We knew that our oceans would rise and destroy thousands of coastal homes and cities, and the temperatures on earth would be, well, uninhabitable, as David Wallace-Wells might say. Wildlife would migrate to the polls to avoid the heat, and ecosystems would be thrown into disarray. Storms and weather incidents would cause more harm than ever before. Our world was going to crumble, but we, with the help of Bernie Sanders and the coronavirus, were able to stop this from happening. We still have a long way to go until we have repaired the damage we have done, and we still probably will not fix it fully. But, we have made progress. I will report back in 2100.

Dear me,                                   <br><br>

It is currently 2040, and the climate crisis situation is escalating as the effects of excessive greenhouse gas emissions are finally starting to be noticed. When I was younger, there was a lot of denial about the state of our planet, and fossil fuel interests took measures to instill doubt in the public. People would have rather relied on technological advancements to better the environment instead of taking action themselves, but now, they have realized the severity of this situation and there is no longer any question about whether anthropogenic climate change is real.
                                   <br><br>


America has passed laws regarding carbon fees to incentivize the reduction of carbon emissions, causing national emission rates to decrease. Congress consists of more people who prioritize climate change in terms of the political agenda, and they attack environmentally problems that are also harmful in other ways. For example, there are laws regarding mass production in sweatshops in places such as Bangladesh and Indonesia so that fast fashion is no longer deadly to the people that are responsible for making the clothing. Furthermore, there have been major improvements to public transportation infrastructure, which has allowed for less car use. The obsessive consumerist culture, unfortunately, still exists in America as people still remain fixated on the newest and most high-tech product that has been released. It was up to my generation to educate the following ones to change this culture. But many of us never even realized how we, ourselves, were trained from birth to value materialistic possessions so highly, and we failed to change this culture. Still, I think our generation has overall been more effective in communicating changes aims toward mitigating the climate crisis that the previous ones.

                                   <br><br>

For me, personally, I finally got my act together and stopped eating red meat and have greatly reduced my consumption of other types of meat as well. More than that, I follow a climatarian diet and have raised my kids to do the same. Although I had always thought about having between 2 and 4 children, I decided to have two kids, and this way, I refrain from contributing to the issue of overpopulation. Instead of taking several vacations in a year, I consolidate them into one big trip per year with my family so that we can still enjoy traveling with slightly less harm to the environment. Whenever possible, we use slow travel instead. These are just a few measures that I have taken to help mitigate the climate crisis, but I continue to search for other ways to do my part.


Sincerely,                                   <br><br>

Your future self

Dear future self,                                    <br><br>

When you read this, it is probably 2060. This is a letter from 40 years ago 2020. at that time, I am taking a course of climate crisis 101, talking about the climate change in the world at that time and what we can do about it. The climate change at that time has already started due to the growing population, burning fossil fuels and so on. In that fantastic course, we learned a lot about what should we do from many different perpectives, such as personal action, climate activist, and communication. From that course I think I learnt a lot, I knew the truth and things we can do in our daily life to change the situation.
                                   <br><br>
I have a really optimistic view about the future. I think in the future 40 year, more and more course adn activities will started to appear, which means more and more people will started to know what the truth about climate crisis like what we do now. As a result more and more people will be able to start to act to change the situation. With the help of all those people, I think the world will be much better, and climate crisis and uninhabbitable earth will not be a problem any more.
                                   <br><br>
However, I think we cannot stop although we have a better environment and we do not need to care about the climate crisis. We certainly do not want to see the climate crisis again and fight with it on more time, so that we need to keep doing what we do to save the climate crisis to keep the situation good in the future for the goodness of futher future. Only  in this way the world is a much better world without climate crisis.
                                   <br><br>
Above all, the reponsiblity to change the situation is on our generation, so we need to actually act to change the world for a better future.

This is you writing from the year 2060. A lot has changed since the winter of 2020. One of the most life-changing things happened to you at that time, and that is being a part of the Climate Crisis 101 class. Even now I think about how much of an impact Ken has made in your life within the ten-week time period that he had to teach. This class kindled a spark in me to do something greater for the planet, rather than being a passive spectator to the seemingly unstoppable mess. I want to let you know that I am proud of you. I am proud that you were able to use environmentalism, climate activism, and justice to bring a change to this world. Though many fueled by fossil fuel companies still continued to do so, an overwhelming amount of citizens were able to put their foot down and let it be known that this is not how we want to leave the planet for the future generation. It’s a miracle that I am writing to you now considering it was such a long and arduous journey, that I wasn’t sure if we would have been triumphant in the end. 
                                    <br><br>

I have to say that at times I was very hopeless and discouraged in these forty years. It seemed as though there wasn’t a viable solution to this problem that is eating our planet alive. Although there isn’t much of a “cure” per se for this behemoth of a disease we created, we were successfully able to move in the right path when it came to mitigating many citizens’ extreme carbon footprints. At times it seemed that there was no possible way that we could ever stop the ever-growing carbon footprint of our nation. At times I wondered if this world will ever stop revolving around fossil fuels and the money it brings. Thankfully though years of more concrete scientific research, even those who didn’t believe it in the first place slowly started shifting their positions on the issues. We were successfully able to make the climate crisis a bipartisan issue like it once was. 
                                    <br><br>

Making the climate crisis a bipartisan issue was the first monumental step to start resolving this terrifying issue. It kickstarted multiple initiatives in order to act fast. Though back then it seemed like we had a lot of time before we reached 2050 to take our time with this issue, I respect our government’s drive and determination to work towards a solution. I believe if the government wasn’t on board with dealing with the climate crisis, we probably would have been set back a decade or two in our progress. The government did play a huge part in this initiative, but it was all of our generation, and many from older generations as well,  that rallied, protested, and wrote into the government to make sure that change will happen. Without their constant pressure, the government would have never cracked. 
                                    <br><br>

Now that I am sixty, I am fairly happy at what I was able to leave for future generations, which includes my children and their children. It was hard at first to always make the most environmentally friendly choice for all aspects of our lives, but it was well worth it because one less person emitting CO2 into the atmosphere. Just like this one person turned into hundreds, which turned into thousands, and so on. What’s even more exciting is that discussion about the climate crisis and what we can do to help it is now taught in school to young children who will start making these environmentally sound decisions.
                                    <br><br>

I can only hope that this progress will continue and that we will continue to preserve this beautiful. Always remember what AOC once said, “We can be whatever we have the courage to see.”

A message from the future.
                                    <br><br>


It is the year 2060 and things have improved in terms of the health of our planet. We have stopped using fossil fuels as much as we did in the past. In addition, many people have switched to a planet based diet. However, many species have gone extinct. My best advice for you in 2020 is to act sooner than later, because although advancements have been made, there is still many ways our way of life can improve to benefit the planet. One major issue is consumerism. Many people still believe that having more is better and will make you happy. Our culture is very competitive and everyone is trying to overachieve by buying the biggest home, most expensive car, have the biggest pool, and more. As a result, many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and our planet is taking the toll for it. I would advise you to watch a film called Minimalism. I watched it back in college at UCSB and it honestly changed my life. This film made me realize that by continuing to search for happiness by purchasing items, I am contributing to the planet's poor health. One thing that an expert in the film said that caught my attention was "Americans are living their best life ever, but there's still a longing for more." Experts mention advertisements and social media as encouragers of this consumerist lifestyle. Advertisements make us feel like we need more to fulfill our lives, when in reality we don't need those things to make us happy. Another film I would advise you to watch is called Happy. After watching this documentary, I feel like I have a better understanding as to what really makes us happy. One part of the film that stood out to me was the pie chart showing the percentages of what things make us happy. I was stunned to see that our circumstances such as our social status, wealth, and job only accounted for ten percent of our happiness. If this pie chart is accurate, then I think we as Americans need to reassess our goals in life and focus on what really matters because if we don't, the planet's current state will worsen to a point of no return. Many across the globe have this mindset that "big is better" and "the more the merrier," however, this is dangerous for our environment because more lands will be cleared out for bigger homes and more crops. As more homes are being built, less habitats will be available for animals to live in, which will result in a decreasing wildlife population.

                                    <br><br>

I hope the other generations will still help improve the climate when I am gone. We have done all that we could do.

Dear future me:
                                    <br><br>

The world’s situation is getting worse because we humans destroy the balance between the nature and the humans. As young generations, saving planet is our duty. We need to start to change our lifestyles as soon as possible. A good healthy lifestyle can help reduce global warming. I also hope future me can work in an aviation company and develop more environment friendly aircrafts. These kind planes can reduce the carbon emission. People need to travel, and eco friendly planes can solve these problems. I think I can definitely do that. I also want to be an environment official. We need to use less fossil energy and burn less fossil energy. It is also good for us to call for protests to fight for our rights. I will educate more about climate crisis for my children. Education is really important, and my children will have better lifestyles after receiving these knowledge. Eng23 is really helpful, and I can tell my children about what I have learnt in Ken’s class.
                                    <br><br>

If I have a family, I will study more from the family in a previous film which save a lot. Abandoning quick fashion brands is also important. When we buy clothes from Zara and H&M, we find the prices of these clothes really attractive as they are cheap and fancy. My future family should reduce waste in clothing to care for workers who receive low wage in these factories.
                                    <br><br>

It is easy to say than do. We should always keep this principle: SAVE in mind. In the last video, I know the 20 suggestions for making the world better. We should remember these suggestions all the time. I do believe the world can be beautiful again!
                                    <br><br>

Thanks Ken, thanks for teaching these useful knowledge to us!

A message from a past you: 
                                    <br><br>

2020 was a year of building. But like most change that occurs, destruction had to occur prior to it coming into fruition. The economy was completely shattered by the Corona virus. A nationwide quarantine was issued into effect mid March until late April. What people failed to realize in early January was the potential devastation of a nation wide pandemic, and lack of preparation left many to suffer. People were thrust into poverty. From the ashes of the economy lay people fighting for their safety. The government did little to protect them. Banks took a holiday and left the savings of the American citizens nowhere to be found. It was a disaster nobody was looking out for. 
                                    <br><br>

But from the ashes stood a new legion of people committed to making positive sustainable change. This vanguard of citizens vowed to not let the past mistakes of America’s citizens continue for any longer. The pandemic shook the core of every person into submission; nature can truly be mankind’s downfall at any given moment. The lack of care towards the virus brought attention to another issue that was being completely put aside in the recent years leading up to 2020, the climate crisis. 
                                    <br><br>

This vanguard adopted many policies to ensure humans were not emitting dangerous levels of CO2 as before. The beef industry was brought back but capped out at a limit, which rendered it almost exclusively dairy product oriented as the meat itself was too heavily taxed to profit efficiently off of. Local communities bonded together over shared gardens. Eco-friendly technological advancements were reached at record setting milestones, proving that the future of mankind when put to the test, can bring all of humanity together after such perilous times. The devastation from the virus left many in shambles, but the hope for a safer and healthier Earth kept them together fighting towards a common goal.

I had been learning a lot about the issue of Climate change for the past ten or so weeks. I learned about different perspectives and why vegans and minimalists do the things they do. I decided that I wanted to live a peaceful minimalist lifestyle. I did not become vegan but I found out about a new lifestyle. Climitarainism. This lifestyle appealed very much to me as it focused on eating sustainable foods, and I could still eat meat in much moderation. I did not have to give up anything, and it led me to eating healthier. But then in March of 2020 the Corona virus took the world by storm. Classes had to go online till the end of the year, and some of our finals got cancelled. I was given an A for the final in Eng 23.
                                     <br><br>

But I can still remember the general gloom my classmates felt as we waited to go home, our year was cut short. I was genuinely scared of getting the Corona virus. Not for my self but for my immuno-compromised sister. I did not want to be a vector for the disease. But also, I saw how people reacted to the crisis. Instead of acting responsibly many people decided to hoard toilet paper, frozen food, and many other non necessities. People also began hoarding those and many other things like hand sanitizer which immuno-compromised people rely on in order to keep themselves safe. They often didn't do this to stockpile but did it to sell again at a much higher price, "price gouging." Many others, some of them public elected officials who are supposed to keep the general population safe, decided to turn a pandemic into a political issue. They tried to sneak anti-abortion bills into important legislation for combating the pandemic. The president called a hoax designed by democRATS. Some encouraged families to go out. 
                                    <br><br>

I worried about how much worse our behavior will become when we are faced with constant natural disasters and sustained droughts and famines. I fear that far before the Earth becomes uninhabitable we will tear each other apart instead of working together. I then strived to have a bigger positive impact on the planet. I had already voted for Bernie but I decided to try to convince my friends and family to do the same. Bernie did not end up winning as not enough young voters turned out to properly represent all of America. We learned an important lesson as a generation. We either need to vote or... that is the only option we have. Personal actions will only go so far in combating climate change. In 2024 the boomers become complacent and the younger generations vote in droves. The senate and presidency becomes blue. We enact sensible legislation that enacts a lot of change in a short amount of time. Much of the legislation is inspired by the Green New deal. We take some economic hit as we transition but we serve as a leader to the entire planet as many begin to lead happier minimalist lives. Obviously life is not perfect as we still have effects of the climate crisis. But at least we acted when we did.

It's you, from 2060. It's been a long time. How are you? You're in a great stage of your life right now -- college. Exciting things are just beginning. I can understand how nervous you might be, as a good future is never guaranteed. Luckily, you have the privilege of taking classes that can educate you on how to secure a beautiful life, such as this class, English 23. I'll never forget that class! I learned so much not only about the climate crisis but also about human culture, travel, fashion, food, consumption, communication, selfishness, fear, ignorance, generosity, the value of life, and happiness.
                                    <br><br>

I won't spoil the amazing and unexpected things that happen to you in life (but girlllll... GREAT things are coming!), but I do want to talk about the plans with which you followed through in order to make the world a better place.
                                    <br><br>

Let me just spare you the anxiety by saying NO, you did NOT become vegan! You didn't even become vegetarian! Relieving, right? Well, you did stop eating red meat. And you limited the fish, chicken, and turkey you consumed, and you only bought food from sustainable farms! 
                                    <br><br>

After graduating from UCSB in 2022, you planned and successfully executed your trip to Europe that you had been planning for so long! You only flew on an airplane twice. You flew into Switzerland, took a train to Italy, took a train to Spain, took a ferry to Ireland, and a plane back to the US. The trip lasted four whole months! 
                                    <br><br>

After your grand trip, you moved back home with mom and dad to relax, try out different jobs, and save up for a couple years. Really surprising things started happening but I won't spoil ;) 
                                    <br><br>

In 2026, you finally bought your own house! It was small -- just like you wanted! 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, about 1,000 square feet. Relatively cheap, on the outskirts of LA. You fixed it up so nicely (lots of floral curtains and pretty colors). It was powered by solar panels (in your backyard) and grid energy. You made a lot of memories in that house (yes... lots of dinner parties). 
                                    <br><br>

You kept your grandpa's car until it broke down in 2040. However, when you did have it you used it sparingly. Otherwise you used your fixie bike to get around. Later, you bought another used car and used it sparingly. 
                                    <br><br>

In your everyday life, you made it a habit to take short showers only when you needed to, buy 90% of your clothes from thrift stores (that 10% being your jeans... it's very hard to find the perfect fit and style of jeans at thrift stores), buy groceries in bulk, and visit the farmer's market frequently in order to support locally grown produce and reduce waste (ex. you would pack fruits and vegetables into glass jars and other reusable containers).
                                    <br><br>

Throughout the past 40 years, you've voted for politicians whose #1 priority is the safety of the people. That means that they all supported the necessary changes in order to combat the climate crisis and they all put climate change at the top of their list.
                                    <br><br>

Before I leave you, I want to recount all of your favorite favorite quotes you got out of English 23 in 2020:
                                    <br><br>

                                    <br><br>

"Part of why we consume a thing is because we work for so long. People can’t find fulfillment in their jobs and they need some way to tell themselves that it’s worth it. They buy a car or a big house and they can say 'see? All the hard work is actually worth that number in the bank account'" - "Minimalism"
                                    <br><br>

"You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with"; and so he religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of every obstacle" - Henry David Thoreau 
                                    <br><br>

"If you reduce your emissions that’s good but if you don’t let the world know you’re doing that… [then what's the point?] if you’re an artist make art about it… if you’re a musician make music about it… if you’re a writer write about it” -- "Being the Change"
                                    <br><br>

Leanne, don't worry about the future. You have it in you to make the necessary changes to ensure that it's a good one. Just focus on doing what you love and doing for others. Believe in the world. 
                                    <br><br>

As you always say: fear less, sing more, and dream on!

The significance of low-carbon life is profound. Climate warming, rising sea levels, frequent extreme weather ... all these are undoubtedly related to everyone's life. The "low-carbon life" is becoming a way of life in which human beings try to save themselves. To achieve a grand strategy of energy conservation and consumption reduction, it may depend on many subtleties of low-carbon life. The details run through every aspect of life. 2. "Low-carbon life" brings a new concept of quality of life. "Carbon life" does not mean that you cannot drive, live in a large house, or enjoy air conditioning. The true meaning of low carbon is to provide people with the greatest protection and comfort, and have a smaller impact on the environment or help improve the environment. For example, Europe Many zero-emission buildings have been constructed, and the thermal insulation effect is very good. Under natural ventilation, the thermal insulation layer can regulate the indoor temperature to a suitable level and can maintain it for a long time. In the field of transportation, solar vehicles, Biofuel vehicles, etc., while vigorously developing public transportation. Low-carbon life, which came into being when human life was threatened by climate change, is a demand of the earth to human beings. Experts point out that it is impossible for everyone to live a "zero carbon" "Life, when resources are scarce, what we have to do is to use limited resources to meet people's basic needs and limit luxury and waste . At the same time, establish a "low-carbon life" concept, under the optional and replaceable conditions, a natural, environmentally friendly and healthy lifestyle is preferred. A low-carbon life can start with saving one kilowatt-hour of electricity and one drop of water. Make your own carbon footprint.

I consider myself as an environmentalist and a lot of my actions I make in regard to the planet. But after everything going on in the world I am very pessimistic about the future of this planet. I fully believe that we will take serious action once it is too late. Big oil companies have so much control and power in our government with money, so I believe that it will take a big catastrophy or market crash in oil for governments to treat the climate crisis like the big problem that it actually is. This sounds very dramatic and like I think we are doomed as a planet, but I still believe we can all take personal action to maybe revert this and make change. It can be little or small, but any change that benefits our planet is a positive one. This is what drives me in making my life as environmentally conscious as possible. I get told so many times that I am only one person and me not eating meat, or refusing plastic isn’t going to make a big enough of a difference, regardless of the amount of difference one's actions does not matter, but more so the fact that they are trying to make a difference. In order to revert the climate crisis we are going to have to do more than small change, the small change matters but without government and lifestyle changes we may be doomed. This means people need to use their voices and speak for the trees, animals, the environment in general, and everything else and everyone else who doesn't have a voice, it will take a lot but we have to start somewhere until it is too late. 
                                    <br><br>

I hope we educate the future generations about this crisis and create a new generation of climate activists. This is going to sound morbid, but once all of the boomers are no longer around we will have a larger amount of climate change activists versus the big generation of climate change deniers around (boomers). I hope we can educate on not only the climate, but reproduction, family planning, birth control, food waste, and everything that has a major impact on climate change. I always go back and forth between pessimistic and optimist about the environment, but maybe with more knowledge, education, and technology we will be in process of saving or have already saved this planet in 40 years, I really hope we are able to do this, there is no planet B.

March, 2060.                                     <br><br>

“Granny, why you always eat potatoes and broccoli?” asked my young granddaughter. 
                                    <br><br>
“If I don’t eat plants, maybe you won’t have meat, my little sweetie…” 
                                    <br><br>
Yes, she would never know what we’ve been through these 40 years. Things changed not that much, but not that subtle. 
                                    <br><br>
First of all, I’m still alive, on this Earth. No dooms-day extinction. So relax. 
                                    <br><br>
Then about the US. That day when I checked my daily news claiming Democrats took over the house, my now seemed to be outdated mode iPhone dropped on the ground with a “YASSSS”. I knew this is the election of Americans and as an international student, especially without the right to vote, it's just none of my business. However, my mind kept telling me this is not an election of one country, but the whole world’s future. People here finally start to take the impending climate crisis seriously. Green New Deal has been implemented. Carbon Tax is on. At the first stage Conservatives were still provoking anti-climate change resistance among the public. People were protesting; economy experienced difficulty; irritated corporations set pressures on innocent people; poor laborers lost their work...Everything seemed to match with the prediction of the deniers. However, the perfect thing about GND gradually came to sight as the policies specifically designed for the poor, the jobless, and even community construction quickly went into action. Suddenly, people perceived that the pitfall was only temporary. Nothing was unplanned. The government offered plenty of recovery solutions, each of which was based on the Deal’s core. Building up confidence and trust to their leaders, people finally reversed their disappointment, finding healthcare, living conditions, and basic rights well-protected and highly valued. The situation won the public for rendering better life, and thus, convincing the deniers for bipartisan cooperation. With the help from both sides, sweeping changes appeared rapidly. And they were not merely within this country, but all others around the globe. Due to the distinguished employment of Carbon Tax, we connected environmental issues to economy, interest group, and profit, making the action never negligible. Though fossil fuel corporations were antagonistic towards the whole system, they had to succumb to the shift of public interests. And under the guidance of US model, other countries joined the trend together, with both the Global North and South working together. In all, the climate crisis took our attention with long-term effort. 
                                    <br><br>
Let’s just focus back on me. I can summarize all those changes reflected on my life into one word--better, both spiritual and physical. I live in a co-housing community, but not that traditional type: in my new design, I adopted a traditional Chinese architectural structure “Siheyuan”--which allowed four flat houses to form a circle and created open sharing spaces in the center courtyard for recreation, dining, or growing food. And because the center loop is hypaethral without a rooftop, we directly let the sunlight in without installing expensive and complex(in my opinion) solar panels. This sharing space formed so much happiness among diversified families. We share food, spaces, opinions, and even “children”--thanks to our community, I discarded the thoughts of having two or more children due to the fact that we already have four kids in our community, and they are so cute that all of them are like my own ones. During weekends, I like to go biking with my husband (yeah I’m still biking in my sixties). We once thought about traveling to the Maldives, the dreamland of us, but...truly bad news...it got fully submerged due to sea-level rise cuz we didn’t take timely action. This heartbroken reality made us determine not to fly anymore (and as a 60-year-old, flying should be real torture). Oh btw, since the whole trends of culture has changed, and also thanks to the education improvement for all boys and girls, people finally realize the ridicule of consumerism. Here’s something you definitely want to know (cuz Holly you spent most of your time in 2020 on stupid media): minimalism and veganism are revered online. Rather than posting wealth on Instagram, people prefer health. There are even competitions and challenges for changing lifestyles. Yeah right that old woman learning skateboard in the trending video is me...
                                    <br><br>
In the end, I just want to say: everything is getting better, really; unless you 2020 guys take immediate actions! Or these imaginations will only remain imaginations. We should always be positive and active, and then this future is truly waiting for you! (Calling for future cohousing mates in my “Siheyuan” probably in the 40 years to come lol)

The opening scene was heartwarming with you sacrificing meat for your grandchild to enjoy. Perhaps, letting international students vote might not be a bad idea because this pool of candidates is fairly educated. Therefore, I believe they possess the knowledge and power to change our world for the better. This is the type of foreign affair we should deal with not some Russian agents revealing top secret information to our presidential front runners. The United States has always been a leading country and serves as a role model for others around the world. Other countries will follow our footstep and learn from our mistakes so we must serve as the perfect exemplary for those who hope to develop a more sustainable establishment. I wonder how the economy has changed since the implementation of the Green New Deal and the Carbon Tax. I read the other day that if Medicare for All has been implemented, then if would actually save tons of money in the healthcare industry with the elimination of the health insurance industry. The problem is will people willing to give up the opportunity to cash in for the benefit of all. It is hard to reverse the system of capitalism because too much investment has gone into the process of making more money. Humans have instincts for survival. As time goes on, money became a tool, a steppingstone for us to achieve the next level in terms of material goods, jobs, etc. The outline of the Green New Deal did not illustrate where and what kind of jobs these desperate people will end up getting. I think it would be more effective if they provide more details regarding this matter. By giving people the security, you will receive more support on the other end. I think there always will be some sort of fear of being overturned by the wealthy individuals. What if one day, they decide to take over and they have the means to do so. The government needs to have a backup plan to combat such situations. I hope this socialistic approach does not end up in communism. There’s only a thin line between socialism and communism and if the government holds too much power, I’m afraid we would be heading down the wrong path. My great grandparents used to live in a Siheyuan in Taiwan. Honestly, it was not the ideal living situation but I appreciation your incorporation and giving it an upgrade would be helpful. I envy the lifestyle that you created upon yourself and I hope that everyone will get to experience it in the future. Thank you for sharing it.

Awww this is such a cute heartwarming comment and I really enjoyed reading it! I really like how your comment is super descriptive yet visual at the same time that I can just imagine such scenes with a clear, vivid picture in my head! I find myself completely agreeing with your comment because in my own letter from a future self I also mentioned the drastic changes and sweeping transformations occurring with the U.S. with newly proposed laws and regulations to limit our per capita carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere. Similarly, I also discussed the takeover of our Congress with a new group of people who may not necessarily be all Democrats but rather people from all political parties united together with one goal in mind, and that is to save our deteriorating environment and humans ourselves. I imagined a group of young, ambitious, and environment-conscious politicians and environmental activists from the Generation Z or younger--they are people around our ages or younger--because I know that we need "new blood" or new generations of people with fresher younger and more progressive minds and ideas in Congress who would push for environmental-sound laws and regulations if we want changes to happen. As a result of the restructured Congress full of new members and ideas, sweeping environmental changes are quickly occurring within the U.S. in an effort to mitigate the climate crisis before everything is too late. I also brought up the topic of the carbon tax in my comment because it is such a crucial step and beginning in our government's attempt to limit the carbon emission from animal agriculture and the fossil fuel industries and sectors. Lastly, I want to point out that both of our letters from our future selves have an optimistic and positive undertone and outlook onto the future of this planet and its inhabitants as we along with many people in this comment section believe that we have the power to change our future for the better if we are willing to try and make the efforts to change our lifestyles and ways of living and inhabiting our environment for a more environmentally-friendly, green, and sustainable future life for us and our descendants.

I know this may sound weird but this is you from the future. Actually you from 40 years in the future. I’m writing to you tell you all of the things we have done in the past 40 years and that you should not worry. I mean, since I am writing back from 40 years in the future, that means that we have survived to at least live till 61 (I know insane.) To tell you the truth, not everything is perfect but we for sure did a lot to help decrease our footprint.
                                    <br><br>

As you have always wanted, we moved into a small but cozy home in a city that is just right. After hearing about how having a smaller home would help the environment, you became happy because this gave you an explanation as to why we would move into a home others would not. Growing up people always thought we were weird since we were happy with the little things. Instead of having kids, we just had a few cats that we adopted from the shelter. Slowly throughout the years we have cut our meat consumption down by resorting to some of our favorite meals: pasta and potatoes (we never changed.) In addition, we never got our driver’s license since it wasn’t ever necessary with how far public transportation has gone. We ride the bus all over the place: to get to work, to get groceries, to travel downtown, and more. It doesn’t seem like much has really changed from our habits because we were doing pretty well in the first place. We still have our collection of video games and Harley Quinn figurines but we made sure that we don’t go overboard. As we told ourselves, we are only going to keep what will fit in the house and not look like a mess. We started to donate our time to help with recycling new clothes and fixing things for other people to help reduce the waste that we all produce. We’ve made a good amount of friends by doing so and it has been nice finally having the support to do these things without feeling weird. It was tough transitioning out of college and into our adult life because many people criticized that we didn’t want a big home with a couple of kids. It was frowned upon that we wanted to move away from California to somewhere new where not every person was so attached to their material goods and how that made them looked. It was hard but we did it and now we have our own little family that is supportive of us on this journey of lowering our greenhouse gasses. Truthfully though, these actions lowering our greenhouse gasses were just a plus to the life we always dreamed of. 
                                    <br><br>

For the whole world perspective, well…I hate to break it to you but it took much longer than any of us wanted it to take. It took probably close to 5 years before we made any big decisions that were better for our environment. Now we are using all renewable energy and lowering our production of beef. Unfortunately, our waste is still a big problem here in the US mainly due to what is considered to be “in.” Unfortunately there is nothing we ourselves can do to stop this other than to continues to only buy things we need and upgrade when necessary. It seems as though the fast fashion has somehow gotten faster to the point where it is impossible to keep up. Some things never change and this is something I still wish would change. The good thing though is that the fashion and tech industry has slowly been changing the working conditions for the better. Every step toward a better direction counts even if it is not necessarily the biggest step. I will say, I am very proud that we have become a fully renewable energy country. Seeing this big change makes me hopeful that we can cut down our greenhouse emissions even more to no more than we actually need. 
                                    <br><br>

Overall, I just wanted to tell you that things can and have gotten better in the past 40 years. Or well, your next 40 years. It’s all going to be okay and the world is not doomed. We just need to continue doing what we are doing and encourage others to do the same. Before that though, spreading our knowledge of the Climate Crisis will help tremendously because knowledge is power and will help others to understand the severity of the entire situation. All I ask of you is to make sure that you do not lose hope in all of the negativity in this world. There is positivity and hope, you just need to keep looking for it for just a little longer.

A message from 2060 me:
                                     <br><br>

The year is 2060, and the climate crisis is still very much alive. Why, you might ask? Nobody was willing to change. By the time 2020 hit, the world was too far down the rabbit hole of consumerism and emissions to change anything. Big fossil fuel companies still have too strong of a hold on the government. People in government are still too power hungry to actually make a significant change and nobody who wants to make a significant change is ever voted into office. Nothing in government has changed. All these people want is power and to help America, not the rest of the world which needs saving.
                                     <br><br>

You voted for Biden in the primary and the general election, but to no avail, Trump won. What arose from his second term? Just a continuation of 2016-2020, so nothing being done about the climate. In 2024 we elected a president who had a plan to solve many of the problems of this country and the world. His campaign for the 2020 election was revolutionary and he introduced some ideas that the country was not ready to hear. The goal was never to win that year, as nobody was going to beat Trump. In 2024, he refined his ideas such as The Freedom Dividend to be more realistic and accomplishable. He ran on unification, with policies that attracted Democrats and Republicans alike. Andrew Yang became the president in 2024. He recruited a super-cabinet of some of the strongest minds in many fields in order to solve the issues facing the country. America was heading towards being one of the laughingstocks in the world when it came to dealing with the climate crisis to one of the frontrunners.
                                     <br><br>

However, by this point people thought it was too late. Things were not getting better and fossil fuel interest groups were still prevalent in attacking Yang's policies. People didn't like change and Yang was promoting too much of it. They didn't give his ideas enough of a chance, as he wasn't able to get them all done in just four years. This is where America made their biggest mistake. Yang loses in 2028, instead America favors a candidate who is basically Trump 2.0. This is when most people, including you, lost hope. If Yang could not get it done, then who could? The climate crisis went spiraling down into a terrible turn of events.

Geographically, the world has changed a lot in 2060. The island of Sri Lanka, along with many others do not exist. Island dwellers tried to immigrate everywhere, especially the United States because of the "freedom" they provided. However, they were turned away at virtually every border despite having literally no place to turn back to. The reason they were turned back is that, frankly, there was not enough room for them. Countries just can't take more people. For example, in the United States, half of the state of Florida is underwater. People have moved more inland because the coasts are becoming submerged and people are living far too close together. This is not just happening in the United States. People of all countries are having to move inland to avoid being overtaken by the rising sea levels. There are 10 billion humans on Earth and they're living far too close together. We were told to live in big cities, but unfortunately with so many people there disease is rampant, especially since we did not cut down on our waste. Certain cities are just completely abandoned and look like a scene straight out of Wall-E (No, Ken somehow still hasn't seen Wall-E in the year 2060).

People are waiting for a breakthrough in space technology so that they can hopefully move out of this hell. They're competing for wealth so that they can afford to be the ones to make the trip to space and survive. This comes at the expense of the lower classes, who face the travesties of the climate crisis such as a lack of clean water and air every day, similarly as to how they did in 2020. However, progress on this space mission is halted because funding has gone towards trying to save the planet we currently live on. Finally, people realize it's a problem, but now, in 2060, it is officially too late, if it had not been before.
                                     <br><br>

What did you do about it? Not as much as you should have, but it would not have made a difference either way. You switched to a diet that excluded beef, as it was better for the environment and your health. You even stopped drinking cows milk, which took a while to get used to. You moved to a city, because that's where you were working, and used clean transportation to get to work. You voted in every election for candidates who you agreed with. Although you said you would never be a "crazy political person who gets involved with stuff like that", you actually went out and campaigned for Yang in 2024. You did not do the same, however, in 2028 because you were too busy and figured Yang had it in the bag. Every incumbent president in the last 36 years had been re-elected, so you didn't go all out like you did in 2024. When Yang lost, you put the blame on yourself. You could not live with the knowledge that you did not do everything you could to fix the climate change, so you wrote this message to your 2020 self to relieve this stress.
                                     <br><br>

You did this. You can change that. You.

Dear my past self,

It is 2060. Over 90% of the coral reefs have died. Wildfires have scorched our Earth until the bare grounds remain. A major hurricane or tornado happens every year and all of the world experiences extreme weather conditions. I remember back in 2020 there were people who did not believe in climate change, there are no such people this year. Everyone believes in the climate crisis because we are living in it.
                                     <br><br>

I remember that 2020 was supposed to be a pivotal point for the fight against climate change. 2020 was supposed to be the age of the New Green Deal, however in order to have done so we were supposed to get Bernie Sanders as the president, but we failed and got Joe Biden as the democratic nominee, and he was unable to beat Donald Trump. With Donald Trump as the president, the New Green Deal movement faltered. Skepticism of climate change continued to grow, and our carbon emission increased beyond the limit set by the Paris Agreement. Other countries tried fighting against climate change by reducing their carbon emission. By 2050, most of Europe operated using public transportation and bicycles, and most of Europe had successfully converted to clean energy. However, their efforts were not enough to combat against our growing carbon emission, and our global temperature began to rise little by little yearly.
                                     <br><br>

It was only until the climate got so bad that it was no longer deniable did we Americans start trying to change, but by then, there was already some unrecoverable damage. I am writing to inform you of the future that happens when you do not go out and vote. The future I described will come to existence if you do not get up and join the fight against climate change. Please do not take what you learned from Ken's class and throw it in the trash. Try to eat less meat, thrift for clothes instead of buying new ones, and please try to reduce your air travel. Use the knowledge you learned in order to create a world better than the one the future you is living in now.

2020 had proved itself to be a tumultuous year. Even though the climate crisis was still looming around the world, a new crisis arose, one that proved to everyone that we are capable of acting quickly in the face of a pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak was a global virus that spread quickly due to our traveling habits, and lack of awareness of how this disease spread. People rushed to stores to clear out shelves of toilet paper, paper towels, hand sanitizer, face masks, and anything they could to protect themselves, and also hurt others in the process by not leaving enough for others. If only we had this type of response when it came to the climate crisis in that time, we would have saved the planet much sooner. Nevertheless, steps were made around the world that led us to saving our planet, and that helped us recognize the consequences of our actions on the environment.
                                     <br><br>

Perhaps one of the most important things I started doing and taking seriously back then was voting. In the 2020 presidential race, I knew anybody would be better than Trump, but the person we needed the most was Bernie Sanders. Sanders recognized the problems in our country, he knew that we needed to shift our mindset to one of equality and inclusiveness, especially when it came to education and health care. He also supported the Green New Deal, a revolutionary piece of legislation that paved the way for significant changes to our country and energy consumption to be made. Sanders would create over 20 million jobs, transition our country to using 100% renewable energy, and would hold those massive, greedy, and despicable fossil fuel companies accountable for the destruction they have caused to people and the environment. Even today, I cannot stress enough to anybody reading this that voting is important. It matters. Always stay politically active because sometimes it can be the only way your voice is heard. Do your research on candidates, hold your politicians accountable for their actions, and show them what they need to do to continue bettering our country.
                                     <br><br>

As for myself personally, changing the way I impacted the environment took time. In 2020, I cut out red meat from my diet entirely, eating only chicken, turkey, and fish. By 2030, I had gotten the hang of being vegetarian. It took time and effort, as furthering my career was a time-consuming process that made me care little about what I was eating outside of not eating red meat. But the more I switched, the better I felt, the healthier I was, and the less I was impacting the environment. By 2035, I finally achieved my goal I had set in 2020 of going totally vegan. Living in a place like Los Angeles, it became easier to do this as many people around me also cared about eating vegan, so there was never a shortage of restaurants or stores to support this diet.
                                     <br><br>

Shortly after I graduated from the University of California Santa Barbara and moved to Los Angeles, I was finally able to sell my car, and replace it with what was then my dream car, a Tesla. I had wanted an electric vehicle for some time, but didn’t have the money yet. I knew eventually I wanted to transition to riding a bike as my primary method of transportation, but I needed a car to navigate the mess that is Los Angeles, at least for a while. So my Tesla and I conquered the world together. Not literally, but it felt like it when I could drive hundreds of miles on a single charge, and never have to pay for gas, which eventually rose in price due to the implementation of a Carbon Tax, courtesy of Sanders. While I could never let go of owning a car, as the years went on I did ride my bike more, and make it a point to do so. 
                                     <br><br>

Now, in 2060, I live a minimalist, vegan lifestyle, prioritize my friends and family over any material things, still have my electric car and bike, and live in a small, modest house where I compost and grow some of my own vegetables in a garden. The world was forever changed from the climate crisis. It took time for people to really grasp the scope of the issue, but when we elected Bernie Sanders in 2020, that changed America forever. I am grateful for everything I learned about the climate, especially from Ken Hiltner’s classes at UCSB. He paved the way for my future, and was one of the best professors I have ever had the privilege of knowing and being taught by.

Dear Future self,


                                     <br><br>

The date is March 10, 2020 and a storm is brewing in Santa Barbara. Just yesterday we experienced vegetation fires yet again in the mountains overlooking Santa Barbara. Today, rain pours down on our lovely city of Isla Vista and classes have been made online till the end of April due to the dangers COVID-19 spreading around our campus. This year in itself as a UCSB student has been quite the hectic one overall, but especially when it comes to climate crisis as well. We’ve experience crazy rain storms, cliffs eroding per usual, along with various fires in the mountains that have led to mass destruction. While taking my English 23 class called “The Climate Crisis 101,” I as a college student am first hand seeing the effects of human caused climate change in the foot of backyard. The notions of the climate changing in negative ways are not only being observed around the world and through studying, but at the forefront of my residence now.


                                     <br><br>

The destruction of our climate and Earth evidently is at the hands of us human beings, and this is something I learned heavily in this course. The mixture of carbon emission waste with fracking and the beef industry, along with travel, family size, and many other aspects are all forms of why this is happening. The answer to this problem presented in this course is to hone in on the preservation of the climate through concentrating on these aspects and bettering things. Our answers to these problems reside with eating a larger plant based diet, having smaller families, educating women better, living in smaller homes, using better forms of transportation, and the list goes on. We have done the research on how this can be fixed and have nearly proved these ways of living as being effective to helping the preservation of our planet.

                                     <br><br>


Overall as of right now, I do ride my bike longer distances even having a car, focus on eating less beef and consuming a larger plant based diet, along with preaching the answers to these problems to eventually save the planet. I’m assuming you may look back at pictures of the earth in 2020, and can say that if these actions have not been reached to the population overall, I know the Earth is looking a lot worse now than in my time writing this. Even in my short lifetime up until writing this, the evident problem of the climate crisis is seen through dying coral reefs (hopefully some are still alive), catastrophic storms and disasters like we’ve seen, and the warming of our climate overall. When writing this letter, I was on the start to changing the way I lived to help my carbon emission footprint lessen, and have encouraged many others to do the same. I’m writing this hoping that you’ve continued on in your efforts, and even become an activist is spreading the word and making a change to the way we live so you, and the generations preceding have a habitable planet to live on.

Hi, me as a teenager,
                                     <br><br>

 As you saw this letter, you may feel surprised and wonder why I would write to you, which is myself as a teenager, from 40 years behind. Don’t worry, be patient, and let me tell you the whole story.
                                     <br><br>

As a put on my heavy protective clothing, stepping outside the house and sitting on the easy chair at the yard, turning on my aged radio, the sound of the host of weather forecast comes out: “Let’s see what is the weather like today. We have an outdoor temperature of 39 degrees Celsius today, a little bit cooler than usual, don’t forget to wear your protection suits to prevent the deadly diseases and extreme weather…” “What a nice day!” I said to myself reluctantly and with a little bit of despair. Yes, you heard it right, in 2060, the normal temperature increased dramatically compared with 40 years ago. This is mainly caused by the enormous amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted by the fossil fuel industries and other kinds of manufactures. Ever since the lost of Democrats of the election and the veto of the Green New Deal, everything has changed. People around the world didn’t consider the climate crisis as an issue with high priority, they let these severe environmental problems along. With more funds, the fossil fuel industries provide to the climate crisis denials, a variety of propaganda about the idea of “nonhuman-caused global warming” were sent to the teachers, for the sake of brainwashing the children with the idea that “climate crisis is wrong.” Unfortunately, this strategy seems to work. More and more people started to ignore the environment damaged pollutions which is caused by industries. They begin to link the concept of the American dream, which started as about more opportunities, to “Consumerism.” Peoples’ action of purchasing more and more unnecessary fast-fashion clothes follows, although, at that time, the average American is buying about 60 new articles of clothing per year, half of which are worn three times or less. Even worse than that, the majority of people give up the idea of replacing traditional vehicles that depend on fossil fuels to electric vehicles that only emit half carbon dioxide while using. Due to all of these manufactures, great amounts of greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, and the global temperature keeps increasing. Eventually, by 2040, what we called to know “the tragedy of environment” happened—the “methane bomb”, Arctic, was finally melted by the rapidly rising temperature, and nearly 1.8 trillion tons of carbon were released from there and got into the atmosphere, which enhances the global warming eventfully. The temperature rise at that time wasn’t merely lead to the sea-level rise which shrunk the continents of Earth significantly, it also led to more severe wildfires, hurricanes, and a variety of other environmental disasters. Worse than all of these, the greenhouse effect and global warming freed lots of ancient lethal illnesses from the frozen land, thus people cannot survive in the outside world without putting the protection suits on. Trillions of people were killed because of the fatal diseases. However, the total number of people around the world wasn’t declined at all due to the unsolved problem of the “over-growing population.” These people kept consuming the resources of Earth unlimitedly, which once again accelerated the damage of the planet and the extinction of the human race. This was a nightmare.
                                     <br><br>

For me, I did many environment-friendly actions on a personal level. To protect the environment, I gradually switched from the traditional meal which depends heavily on meat on the large plant-based diet. I became a vegan, then a freegan, and eventually a climatarian in eating, who chose to have a healthier meal for the sake of the environment. Also, I switched from long-distance air travel to “slow travel,” which can not only help me to enjoy the process of travel rather than the destination only but also doing good for the climate. This “slow travel” also helped me to reduce my carbon footprint by a factor of ten. Despite these, many other personal actions like taking public transportations and moving to a smaller house in the city and so on were all practiced by me. At that time, I think these are enough, and people can halt the climate crisis by doing these together. However, I was wrong, these actions are not enough, far not enough, for the reason that collective actions ought to also be focused. People should focus on voting for sweeping climate policies, and voting for the candidates who care and willing to take action about the environment. To control the total population on Earth, the education of women and family planning should be emphasized very much, for the reason that the fewer children she will have. According to the study of 2020, women usually don’t have the option to choose when, whether to get pregnant or access to abortion in Latin American and the Caribbean.
                                     <br><br>
In the United States, 45 percent of pregnancies are unintended. Worldwide speaking, there are about 85 million unintended pregnancies annually. All of these data indicate that if the matter of population growth and climate crisis are putting with high priority at your time, your world won’t become hell as my world. However, if people cannot address these issues quickly, the dark future will wait ahead.
                                     <br><br>

These are the story of my world (which might be your future!) and myself, and my solutions and warning are sent to you with the letter. People at your time should focus on addressing the climate crisis as soon as possible, in both the way of personal actions and collective actions, regardless of what it costs. Although one person may not make a huge difference, if people act together and resulting in cultural or political changes, things can be changed greatly. Please consider my advice cautiously, and take them into action quickly to save the human race and the planet they depend on while you still have time and hope.

A MESSAGE FROM THE FUTURE                                     <br><br>

Hey present you,                                     <br><br>

    I know you are so worried about the future and climate change, when you will graduate, what job you will have, what kind of family you will have, etc. All these concerns are valid and I remember them so well. Let’s start at 2020, where you are now. Fortunately, although Bernie Sanders did not get that democratic nomination, Joe Biden, a democrat won and selected Kamala Harris as the first Vice President of the United States. It’s not the candidate you wanted, but it is definitely a step in the right direction away from Donald Trump. But what was really important, was the cabinet he selected with progressives, and eventually, in 2022, congress filled with hopeful new democrats and progressives that took power away from the fading GOP. It was in the midst of a recession however, right when you graduated from UCSB. You did it! But you had a tough time finding work, finding a lot of time soul searching, but decided on something that is always needed; teaching! It was at an inner-city school, Santee HS, with a low graduation rate and you taught mathematics because you really wanted to help these kids out. But you stayed in the city because you wanted to experience all the culture Los Angeles had to offer. And, it was the best for the environment because you were able to bike to work everyday or take the improving metro transit. You lived comfortably with your new wife in this city, starting composting because of her interests, as well as learning to thrift more, scrapping the idea of a car, and living with your best friend so you could do cohousing so that it is better for the environment. Life starts to become better, as the US is drawn out of the recession, and finally you decide to bring a child into the world. New, more progressive candidates are elected, including the first female president, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, in her first year of eligibility. She would become the best president in your lifetime. We start to see more railways, buses, and bike paths across the country, and less and less room for cars. We do not see that smoke in the Los Angeles skyline, or at least was not as thick as it once was. Factories stop spewing out carbon into the air, but rather rely on renewable energy such as the massive wind farms nearby. Medicare for All is seen as a normal, everyday thing now, and other things such as maternity leave, sick pay, Free University, more services for the mentally ill, and a better country overall. New medical innovations destroy diseases that once plagued us, and countries with more progressive leaders make amends and end wars. It all looks good, but the climate change effects from our previous generation starts catching up with us. Temperatures continue to rise, leaving many to leave the hot areas of the world, Florida and Louisiana got hit with floods that left them underwater, and species continued to die off. Many of these issues were shared with the rest of the world. With our improved relations to each other and new sense of humanity, we kept working together to help each other out of the ashes, rather than keep each other there. For the first time ever, we saw Iranians welcome invite American help, and they sent their own to help us when we had our natural disasters. All countries became neighbors, not enemies. We were all going through the same struggles, why not help each other out? As time progressed, luckily, we got better at handling disasters and they seemed to wind down. We were somehow winning the fight in climate change. Every few years, through teleconference, the nations around the world agreed on climate change policies, which they actually followed through with. It was all a struggle, but hear I am, you in the future, in a beautiful park with a flourishing butterfly population enjoying a sunny day watching your grandkids play in a better world. As I said, it was a struggle and hard to transition, but I would be damned if no one would do it again.

Hey, I hope this letter finds you well. 
                                     <br><br>

It’s March of 2020. The nation and the rest of the world are currently in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak. I’m sure you remember this part of your life very well. Our presidential election is currently happening and it’s not looking good for Bernie. Hopefully you are living in a time where equal opportunity is available to everyone. The COVID-19 outbreak is making our country show it’s true nature. People are turning on each other and politicians are proving to be more selfish than ever. I hope this situation teaches us that the government doesn’t care about us, they’re encouraging us to turn against each other in a state of panic. And to top that off, the climate crisis is looming over us. 
                                     <br><br>

Hopefully, you enjoyed your four years in college and it has encouraged you to live a more carbon friendly lifestyle. Ever since I got here, I have been more aware of my carbon footprint. I have transitioned to a mostly vegetarian diet and I rely on biking and walking as modes of transportation. I hope you live in a time where the climate crisis has been solved. It’s not looking particularly hopeful right now, but I have no choice to remain optimistic, because a negative attitude won’t bring change. Our generation is so brilliant and I am confident that we will all collectively end the climate crisis. As the boomers die out, I am confident that the right politicians will be put in place. Hopefully you guys don’t even need reforms put in place because you guys are so far past the planet. 
                                     <br><br>

I hope Kenneth HIltner holds a place in your heart. He was the professor you had first year, he taught the life changing course The Climate Crisis. He’s inspired me to look at the world in a different perspective. Kenneth has successfully encouraged us to go out there and actually make a change in the world. No matter how unavoidable the climate crisis seems, we have the power to change that. Hopefully, you have moved on to better things and the climate crisis seems like a distant memory.

Dearest Me,
                                     <br><br>


Hey, I'm super old but aged like wine. Turning 60 this fall, yikes. Hope you're enjoying 2020, I remember it sucking and it being the beginning of a long era of suckage. 2020 is particularly bad though. As you know, you were forced to put a country between yourself and your friends because of COVID. You'll be faced with a lot of boredom, but put it to use. Learn something, make something, know thyself. Use the time wisely. I know you'll waste that time on the internet, but it doesn't hurt to advise you anyway. 2020 is a hard decade, and I'm sorry. It takes months for things to return to normal in the U.S. Tens of thousands die globally, but quarantine efforts keep that number from reaching the millions. You'll return to California in September, and oh man it is awesome. Things start up again right where they left off. Unfortunately, it doesn't last. Multiple times you are forced to evacuate campus because of a longer and more extreme fire season. The winter is practically rainless once again, and people worry.
                                     <br><br>
On the bright side, Trump is not reelected (barely). Biden took the democratic seat and his moderate stance wins over hesitant republicans and alienates the new left. However, the new left will still support him wholeheartedly over the alternative. The unfortunate side of this is that he is hesitant to embrace the new progressive ideas that democrats want passed through congress like the GND. He makes big promises to calm them down, but doesn't act on them with the level of energy needed. New environmental regulations and infrastructure become a priority, but not to the level the U.S. needs for a sustainable future. The U.S. more or less continues its culture of consumption well into the 2030s. 
                                     <br><br>
In the 2030s, things begin to get worse. There's been a category 6 for hurricanes since the 2020s, and there are multiple storms that hit in this category. Countries like Bangladesh and a large portion of the Caribbean begin to collapse. America wakes up to climate change, and just as things changed in a weekend for COVID, people begin to act with speed. There is panic as natural disasters worsen and occur more frequently, but people are comforted knowing there is a plan in the long term. Unfortunately, the U.S and China decided to act about 10 years after the entirety of Europe. By 2050, the majority of the world relies on renewable power. Coal is a thing of the past. Plant based diets still aren't entirely mainstream, but are on their way there. People are looking forward to the future. However, it doesn't feel like the efforts have paid off. Although the human race will be fine in the long run, millions have died and are still dying due to the collapse of the most at risk countries to climate change. There is deep regret about the continued loss of lives due to the failure to act. The global effort against climate change focuses now towards saving the victims and making reparations, but the past few decades goes down in history as too little too late. 
                                     <br><br>
Disasters are still happening and will continue this way for a long time. The human race is saved, but not enough of us are.
                                     <br><br>
I'm sorry.
                                     <br><br>
Do everything you can with what you have.

<p>
To my children,                                      <br><br>

I hope you had grandkids already as I am 60 years old! No rush, get your education, get a successful career that makes you happy then have kids you truly want to raise in, hopefully, a great world like this. In 2020, I took a class at UCSB called Climate Crisis 101. This class changed my whole view on my lifestyle, my culture, and well, my future. Through this class that was taught by none other than Ken Hilter, an amazing activist and extraordinary professor fighting for our climate. I truly hope the world is in better shape than it was 40 years ago. I hope you're breathing fresh, clean air. I hope you're a practicing vegetarian or freeganism. I hope you aren't spending all your money on clothes and things you don't need. I hope you're getting to places using a bike or your two little legs that grew inside of me. I hope this world provided you a better life than it did mine. 

                                     <br><br>

Climate crisis 101 is the reason why the world is what it is today. The government is made up of the generation who witnessed the worst event in human history, earth's slow death due to human actions. Because of this class, my generation changed so many things culturally, and politically. 

                                     <br><br>

In a cultural sense, we stopped caring what society thinks and started doing what makes us happy and what feels right to us. I, myself, stopped buying materialistic things that don't even matter today. I stopped buying clothes that I knew I didn't need. I stopped using my car and instead decided to move to a city and bike or walk around instead. I stopped eating meat and decided to go completely vegan to help save the planet from all the water it took to raise cows, chickens, pigs, etc. Many of us stopped flying and thus, the reason you rarely see airports because the government took away most of them, only the major ones necessary for cargo.
                                     <br><br>
I also hope that education has gotten better worldwide. I know that there was a problem with overpopulation and women not being educated. It seems that our rapid rate of births has slowed down by 80%! Many women only have one child now which is a dramatic shift from large families to small ones. There are 3 of you, clearly, I loved one so much, I just couldn't help myself to have a few more as selfish as it sounds. Thankfully, you guys learned from my stubborn self and only had one kid each, still waiting on my last baby to give me a grandbaby. But because of this shift, the idea of cohousing blossomed. This is the reason why you see so many people living in apartment complexes and cohousing units. If you don't live in one right now, girrrl/boyyyy, get your butt in one. 

                                     <br><br>

In a political sense, we finally implemented the Green New Deal!!! This was the turning point for my generation because it allowed politics and the government to finally take action towards climate change. This drove the changes that are the results of the world you live in today. The U.S. put a carbon tax and it crazily started to reduce people's carbon dioxide emissions as it was so expensive to keep up with (this was the point of the carbon tax). By reducing companies like fuel/gas companies, and anything that had to do with carbon emissions, it took them out and fortunately caused them to shut down the whole industry. And due to people not spending money on gas and fuel, fewer and fewer cars were being driven, fewer planes were being flown, and more bicycles or electronic friendly vehicles emerged. At the time, it felt as if we were going back in time where we didn't have these extravagant devices and vehicles but it was nice to know that we were putting fewer CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Because of the limited spending on gas/fuel, people saved up and the government reduced the cost of solar panels and thus the majority of the population was able to afford it driving the new renewable energy source movement. This is why you see so many solar panels on houses, malls, structures, etc. This is why you see so many wind turbines throughout the land. 

                                     <br><br>

To close off my letter to you,                                      <br><br>

I really do hope you make better choices than previous generations and you take what I learned from this life-changing class and teach it to your kids and your kid's kids. Be active, eat healthily, save our planet to prevent another global breakdown happening again. Participate in activism, and support each other. Do what I did as I was your age, "Be the change you want to see in the world," I love you always...

                                     <br><br>

Dear 2020 Me,

                                     <br><br>

Calm down. Breathe. I’m still alive, and the planet hasn’t been utterly obliterated yet. I know that in this time you definitely were not optimistic about the future of our planet, discouraged by the government and majority’s inability to act upon the facts we had at hand regarding the planet’s climate situation. I know you wanted to make a difference and see the initiative being taken by your peers to truly make a tangible difference to the world, but you just didn’t know if it was possible. It was.
                                     <br><br>

During this time, the coronavirus was rampant and had affected all our lives, forcing us to transition to remote instruction and changing the lives of everyone in the United States. This devastating situation had finally opened the eyes of everyone that was ignorant, misinformed, and undisclosed to the facts of climate change. While our nation and most other countries bounced back from the impact of the virus after a period of time, this had also brought to attention of the public about the significance of climate change. The emphasis was placed on the other issues plaguing our world that many were unaware of, which spurred a growing conversation and increasingly nationalized focus on climate change. 
                                     <br><br>

Prior to this fundamental change, you had begun transitioning to a plant-based diet as you were inspired to do so from the course. You were incorporating more greens into your diet at the dining commons, not only because it was more healthy, but because you desired to be more environmentally conscious of the sources you were taking from. Although this was hard at first, I can guarantee you that it only gets easier from then on, especially with the acknowledgement of how it shames the meat industry for being such a large polluter and unethical treatment of animals. While you thought you were alone in such a transition at the time, many others began making the change as well as they were becoming more informed. This cultural change took place as people were becoming educated on the physical benefits of a plant-based diet and the quality of the food. In addition, you began initiating more conversations about the topic with your friends on campus and friends back home about the urgency of the situation, calmly discussing and communicating the scientific evidence behind the needed change we had to make. 
                                     <br><br>

During the 2020’s, fundamental environmental policies were enacted that transformed our use of energy sources into a gradual but effective switch to renewable sources. The Green New Deal had finally been completed into a fully structured legislation that would organize America’s transition over that decade, which forever change the course of our nation through the progression of our economy and government. This change was a result of grassroot movements similar to those at UCSB in which awareness towards the flaw of Fossil industries and influences of funding for politicians were brought to light. As a result of this climate activism came political activism in which a massively educated generation profoundly participated in this political shift and produced the largest turnouts for the voting youth ever recorded in history. This fundamental change highlighted the representation and desire for many Americans who had realized the severity of climate change and their will to address it. 
                                     <br><br>

New plans of infrastructure were implemented all across America, changes for education policies among all states were made, and overall, a cultural shift has occurred for the majority of communities in America. Rather than viewing the enacted environmental policies as a threat to our freedom, people in my time currently have accepted them and largely understand its importance. In correspondence with our government’s focus on environmental change were these positive and beneficial changes to political and social aspects. For example, polling places across the entire nation became better organized and informative beforehand, which drastically helped increase voter turnout. Even your neighbors and friends were noticeably undergoing this transition during the beginning stages by slowly moving away from a materialistic lifestyle as culture of renewability and environmentally-responsible sources were helped pushed along by the policies enacted by our state and federal government. 
                                     <br><br>
Other nations followed suit like Russia and China, and the developing countries have been guided in this transition as we had hoped for. This change not only occurred nationally but international as well.

                                     <br><br>
The world is imperfect. Governments have their weaknesses. People are flawed. But despite these discouragements, change that I once felt so pessimistic about actually took place. Keep your head up and do what you will be doing. The world is in the hands of everyone, not just yours.
                                     <br><br>

To whoever might read this,                                     <br><br>

hi. This will sound crazy but I am writing to you from the year 2060. I am 59 years old, have a lovely husband, a daughter, and two baby grandchildren. You might be very confused about why I have decided to write this message, but trust me, it is necessary. I feel like I have an obligation to give you some hope about the future, which - if I remember correctly - didn't look very bright back in 2020. That was the year I was a freshman in college and decided to take a class about the climate crisis. Even today, 40 years later, I am so glad I made that decision. Most people choose their college classes based on their future career, but what I realized was that none of us will have a career when our planet inevitably becomes uninhabitable. Even though I was already very aware of our climate crisis, I had no idea what was to come. That class I took introduced me to the reality of the situation and encouraged me to look at our world from a different perspective, as well as change my own lifestyle. 
                                     <br><br>
2020 wasn't just an important year because I took that climate class in college. It was also the year that we almost made a huge step toward a better, improved future by electing democrat Bernie Sanders as president. Notice how I said "almost". Yes, that didn't quite happen the way I hoped it would. Instead of Bernie Sanders, we got Joe Biden as the new president of the US. Although we defeated Donald Trump, we were still headed for a big catastrophe. Biden didn't do nearly as much as Bernie would have for the climate crisis, which is why 2020 was the start of another decade driven by misinformation, ignorance, and corporate interest. To say that it was a difficult time would be an understatement. Since we didn't adequately reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, everything only got worse. 2024 brought the hottest summer in history, with an unbelievably high death rate, especially amongst the older population. In the fall of 2027, Northern California was almost entirely destroyed by wildfires. It took several years to rebuild the cities that were lost. Earlier that year, Malaysia and Thailand were hit by the deadliest tsunami in history, killing over 600,000 people. The natural disasters only got worse, but people still didn't seem to fully grasp that humanity was at fault. 
                                     <br><br>
Luckily, at the end of 2029, the EU made some huge changes. Renewable energy options were implemented in all European Union countries and the production of meat and fish was dramatically reduced. By 2031, non-vegetarian meals were only offered once a week in grocery stores and restaurants, and by 2033 the extraction of any fossil fuels was banned across all countries in the EU. Public transport was greatly improved and completely free by early 2030 and in 2032, car use was only granted under special circumstances. Along with other changes, the EU drastically reduced its carbon footprint in ways never thought possible ten years earlier. It definitely wasn't an easy development since many people started protesting against these new regulations and even tried to overthrow the European Parliament in February of 2034. However, after a while, it became clear that these changes were necessary in order to keep our planet alive. Throughout the 2030s, other nations started adopting the same laws, including most Asian and South American countries. 
                                     <br><br>
Unsurprisingly, the US was among the last developed countries to finally agree on stopping fossil fuel extraction and greatly reducing meat production. After Biden, Republicans again took over the White House until 2032 when the last Republican's presidency ended. With the start of the so-called "New Democratic Wave", the reign of the Republican party came to an end and there hasn't been a Republican president since. Right now, the US has its third female president and she's been doing such great work, especially in terms of healthcare and education. By the way, can you believe that college has been free for the past 17 years? Back in 2020, I could have never imagined that happening.
                                     <br><br>
I know this all sounds crazy right now, but I feel an obligation to tell you that change is possible if you just keep fighting and standing up for what you believe in. When I was a senior in college, I took part in the largest global climate march ever and even though it still took another six years for the first countries to dramatically change their laws and economy, it was a big step in the right direction. Incidentally, that march was also where I met my future husband.
                                     <br><br>
Of course, there will always be people who have different views, but instead of condemning them, you should use it as an opportunity to educate and inform them about the severity of the climate crisis. I think one of the reasons why it took us so long to make changes was that we looked at this issue as a political one for far too long. When people finally started realizing that it doesn't matter what political party you belong to because everybody on the planet will be affected by climate change, that's when we made real progress.
                                     <br><br>
You might be wondering what life looks like in 2060. Well, when it comes to me, I currently live in a co-housing apartment complex with my husband and our two cats. We moved here almost twenty-five years ago and it has been one of the best decisions we have made when it comes to our life at home. All of our neighbors are such nice people and we all come together at least once a week to cook dinner and just hang out. My daughter turns 27 next month and her twin sons are almost two now. She was originally born in Vietnam, but her birth parents had to flee the country and came to the US. Unfortunately, they weren't capable of taking care of her, so we got to adopt her a few months after she first got put into the foster system. You might not believe it, but adoption is very popular now. Only 48% of families have biological children and the number is expected to decrease even further. My daughter and her wife adopted their twin sons right after they got married and moved into a two-bedroom apartment on the other side of town. Luckily, with public transport, it takes only half an hour to get across town, so they usually spend one day a week with us. If you're wondering - cars are not really a thing anymore. Only old people drive them now. I still remember telling my daughter on her 16th birthday that we would support her if she wanted to get a driver's license and her laughing for several minutes straight, saying that "oh my God, Mom, that would make me super unpopular in school." 
                                     <br><br>
Anyway, now I have to smile when thinking about what life was like 40 years ago. Scientists say that half of the world's population would have been dead now if we hadn't done anything to mitigate the climate crisis. It's really scary to think about that. I can only imagine that you're frightened too, which is why I'm here to tell you to turn that fear into motivation. I know it seems impossible right now - trust me, when I took that climate class my freshman year, I got so freaked out. But instead of worrying about the inevitable future, I decided to do something about it. I immediately stopped eating meat, three months later I stopped eating fish, 10 months later I was fully vegan. Now I am disgusted at the fact that I used to eat animal products when I was younger. The lifestyle I have now used to be called "minimalism" a few decades ago - today, it's seen as totally normal. 
                                     <br><br>
You might feel like all of this is so unattainable and unfeasible, but believe me, it's not. You have to keep fighting for the planet, simply because it has done so much for humanity and now it is time to give something back. I am confident that your generation will be able to make the changes that past generations were too selfish or ignorant to do. Don't give up, keep fighting and I promise you, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

<p>
As I contemplate our current environmental crisis, I can only speculate what course of action I will take towards the situation. In a self-proposed thought experiment, I want to propose my vision of how I will respond to our world’s crisis and the initiatives that I hope to take over the course of the next forty years of my life.

                                     <br><br>

Starting with my own personal actions, I have very high aspirations for my contributions towards the climate crisis. By taking this course, I have learned a lot more about our current situation and the actions that every individual should be taking. Based on my current preferences, I cannot see myself cutting out 100% of meat from my diet and moving to a plant-based diet. While I acknowledge the magnitude that this act would have towards my total carbon footprint, the culture I surround myself with makes this specific lifestyle rather difficult to achieve. Instead, I have found the idea of adopting a climatarian diet very appealing. This would allow me to lower my carbon contribution, while still maintaining the lifestyle I desire. At the same time, it will also force me to stay up-to-date with environmental news and changes, while also making me actively acknowledge my affect on the environment at least three times a day. 

                                     <br><br>

Additionally, I hope to adjust my travel habits toward being more environmentally conscious. I still have aspirations to travel to many different areas of the world, but this dream felt cut short when learning about the negative impacts it could have on the environment. However, Ken provided another option that sounds almost more intriguing than traveling by plane, slow travel. I now have a new vision of myself taking the extra time to travel via bike, train, bus, and even boat in order to reach these new destinations. I believe that this method will greatly enhance my traveling experience and having known I am traveling in an eco-friendly way, will impart a sense of fulfillment! 
                                     <br><br>


Continuing on my eco-friendly train of thought, I imagine that this class will also have an effect on my consumption habits. Having learned all that I have about the fast fashion, food, and technological industries, I aspire to move towards a “more” environmentally friendly and ethically aware system of consumption. I want to put an emphasis on the word “more” that I used because I want to be realistic about my current and future purchases. I am not perfect and I know that every now and then I will likely participate in fashion fads because these are associated with the culture that I am a part of. However, even with these fads, I believe that I have learned enough about the negatives involved with overconsumption that I will be able to make morally and environmentally sound decisions. On that note, I am currently aiming to live a more minimalist lifestyle because of the environmental advantages pointed out in this course. I have started by reducing the amount of clothing and technology that I own and have also moved towards buying second-hand rather than straight from the store. 
                                     <br><br>


Finally, and maybe most importantly, this class has educated me on the importance of voting the correct people into office that will represent my ideals to the fullest. I have learned the significance of having an environmentally conscious representative, partly because we do not currently have one, but also because there are upcoming candidates that support ideas, such as the Green New Deal, heavily. It is crucial that my generation return power only to those willing to help out the world we will be inheriting in the coming years. The course has provided me with new advice, such as reading up on and educating myself about the representative that advocate for sweeping climate policies, which has been incredibly helpful in this year's elections. I hope to remember these ideas and implement them in all future elections as well. 
                                     <br><br>


I know that it will take a lot more than my own personal actions to mitigate climate change, but I hope that these plans will allow me to become actively involved in the end of our world’s climate crisis. I hope to actually adjust my eating, traveling, consumption, and voting habits and not just treat these ideas as a what- if solution. In this sense, I will need to learn incredible self-discipline, but I believe that while this will definitely be the best decision for the Earth, it will also be the best personal adjustments that I can make in my life. By allowing myself to help the world, I will also be changing my own life for the better, which gives me hope that others may also follow suit.

Dear Future,

                                     <br><br>

So many things happened – both good and bad – during the last forty years. Earth is still sick, but it is healing every day. What was once 415 ppm of carbon dioxide is now 250 ppm of carbon dioxide. Global temperatures are decreasing for the first time in almost a century. In 2020, somehow the extreme weather and increasing temperatures were not convincing enough to the public or the government. Though 97% of climate scientists agreed on anthropogenic climate change in 2020, not enough people cared about the issue to make a difference. Meanwhile, in cities such as Paradise and Ventura, deadly seasonal wildfires destroyed thousands of homes, caused many people to evacuate, and left the Earth bare. In Bangladesh, communities could no longer support themselves because of the excess amount of rainfall on crops. Innocent people were left to stave for the season. Even with these treacherous events happening around the world, the United States, the leader in carbon dioxide emissions, refused to take action. The United States was doing the opposite of progress.
                                     <br><br>

The government influenced the climate crisis delay greatly. In 2020, there were still 131 climate change deniers in Congress and 38 climate deniers in Senate. Senators like Mitch McConnel, Ted Cruz, and Paul Ryan selfishly received fossil fuel money and continued to deny climate change. Conservative think tanks such as the Koch Brothers were infiltrating our government to stay in business. These think tanks took it to the extreme by creating Prager University, a fake college made to debunk climate change and provided materials for teachers to teach that global warming did not exist. Furthermore, the United States removed itself from the Paris Climate Agreement which was a promise to not increase temperatures by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. The United States seemed to be digging itself into a bigger and bigger hole. However, I can proudly say that things are finally starting to change for the better.
                                     <br><br>

As my climate crisis professor once said, “You need to take control of this planet – or at least set your sights on that goal – and you need to start today.” While I took my climate crisis class, I was skeptical but still hopeful, that the world was ready to make personal, cultural, and political changes need to end the crisis.
                                     <br><br>

The disease outbreaks that started to increasingly occur got the American people moving. Though most diseases had a decent survival rate, there seemed to be no reasonable explanation for all the epidemics. Scientists then referred to David Wallace Wells's work, “The Uninhabitable Earth” where he talks about how melting glaciers can release diseases that have not existed on Earth for thousands of years. This was a major turning point for the climate crisis. Prior, the public was confused and unsure of whether global warming was an issue. People were forced to believe in the climate crisis and change started to occur.
                                     <br><br>

Once the public understood the significance of global warming, politicians started to listen to their voters. A huge first step was made when the United States government passed the Green New Deal and issued a national carbon tax. Voters of all generations started to comprehend that the disasters mentioned in the Green New Deal were not just made to scare people – they were real, and they were happening now. If we didn’t make a change starting then, there would be no future to save. Politicians also started to realize that the Green New Deal was completely necessary and was more than just a fight between Democrats and Republicans. Ideas illustrated in the Green New Deal such as universal health care, only using renewable energy, eliminating greenhouse gas emissions slowly began to be integrated into society.
                                     <br><br>

The carbon tax was another key part of improving the state of the planet. Just like the Bag Waste Reduction Law, the carbon tax indirectly pushed people in the right direction to start emitting less carbon by charging more for it. The government was finally able to take control of the carbon outtake. The two biggest outcomes of the carbon tax were the 100% increase in the price of meat and gasoline. These effects got the ball rolling a wave of movements such as freeganism, veganism, climatarianism, became increasingly popular. More of the public started to switch their diet and meat factories slowly went out of business. However, those that can still afford meat continue to eat meat. As for transportation, there has been a major switch from cars to public transportation. With the collected carbon tax, the government was able to fund the building of more trains, railways, buses, and subways. The cars that are still being used in rural and urban communities are electric. There is potential for Earth to improve.
                                     <br><br>

I believe the time delay was the biggest obstacle preventing the Earth (and the United States) from making a difference. Once the public was willing to support the climate crisis, everything seemed to slowly fall into place. The United States is now a good model for other countries trying to do their part in the climate crisis. There is still much more work to be done, but the progress we have made is promising. If anything, we were able to temporarily suspend the horrible effects of the climate crisis for another decade or two. Let’s keep doing our part in this climate battle. I am hopeful that the upcoming generation can continue what my generation has started. With the upcoming generation, an end will be put to the climate crisis.
                                     <br><br>

Sincerely,                                     <br><br>

Hello, it is yourself, only 40 years in the future. The year is 2060, and we are about to turn 59 years old. How crazy, it all went so fast. I know that around the time you will be reading this, it should be the last week of your freshman Winter Quarter. What an insane time that was. The COLA strikes, the coronavirus outbreak, I remember being so overwhelmed, (P.S. it ends up being ok, don’t worry too much). I thought now would be a great time to reflect back on what's happened these past 40 years in relation to the climate crisis, which I know you have been studying during that quarter.  By the way, so proud of us for deciding to take that class. Looking back, I know that the lessons we learned in that class have been very important to the way we have lived our life. 

                                     <br><br>

In terms of personal decisions, here is how you have lived your life in an environmentally conscious way the past 40 years. During your third year of college, you finally shifted from being a vegetarian to being fully a vegan, and you have been ever since. While you may think that there are plenty of vegan options now, just wait! It gets sooooo much better. Not only is it easier to cook for yourself, in the future it is much more common for restaurants to have multiple vegan options that aren’t just a salad, so you have that to look forward to. After college, you will move to San Francisco and live in a small apartment in the Sunset District. By living minimalistically, you are able to make do with the space you have. You live a full life there, without a car you walk or take the bus or the Muni, there isn’t anywhere in the city you can’t go. For food, you are lucky because there is a farmers market a few blocks away and you are able to spend time on the roof of the apartment complex tending to the community garden. Living in the city, your carbon footprint is less than half than what it was when you lived in the suburbs. You are more conscious about the things you buy and the activities that you do. While at the beginning you felt like you were missing out on things like flying, driving, and using a machine dryer, but after some time, you will have adapted and it feels like life as normal. After a few years, you come to the decision that you aren’t going to have any children. As you may know now, the idea of having a child wasn’t one that really excited you, and the feeling never went away. You will discuss it with your partner and both of you will agree that there is no need to bring another child into the world, and you are content with that decision. You live in the city for many years, and after a while you decide that you want a change of pace and move to Portland. You are still able to get by without a car as when you want to go back to California to visit family and friends, you can ride the new high speed train. Currently, in 2060, we still reside in Portland, where you have a job that you are passionate about, friends that you love, and a life to be proud about because you have lived it in a way that is compassionate to the Earth and the people that reside in it. 

                                     <br><br>

Now in terms of what the rest of the world has done about climate change since 2020. During the time you would be reading this, I know that the 2020 Presidential primaries were going on. While the dialogue during that time surrounded Biden being the best choice to beat Trump, finally more people realized Bernie was the only one with moral ideas that would help to protect the people and the environment and he will be voted into office! During his two-term presidency, he did a great job getting policies enacted to help mitigate the climate crisis such as a carbon tax that helped to move our energy sector towards renewables like solar and wind. You will be happy to know that now, in 2060, 100% of our energy comes from renewable energy sources. This shift also changed the auto industry, as all new cars being produced are fully electric. Additionally, Bernie poured billions of dollars into improving public transportation infrastructure in the US. It took a while, but now cities are equipped with fast and reliable buses and trains, and a high-speed railway system was built in different parts of the country so much travel has shifted from planes to trains. Bernie also adopted the Green New Deal in the early years of his presidency, and in doing so inspired many other countries to enact green policies as well. Now, countries like China and India are running on mostly renewables, and are working towards going 100%. A universal healthcare system has been put in place, and college is much much more affordable for everyone with the goal being that it will eventually be free. People are much happier now. I remember when I was in college, everyone was stressed about the cost of being there, and how they had to make sure they got a high paying job. Now, it seems like students now are more focused on doing work that they are passionate about, and people like me, in the workforce, do not have to work so many tiring hours as the economy is slowly but surely shrinking, as the cost of living is not as much as it used to be. Not everything turned out completely ok. While we worked quickly to reduce our CO2 levels, the way our government is set up made it so it didn’t quite happen fast enough, and it took multiple years to get people on board with what was happening. Sadly, ocean levels did increase and parts of Florida and many pacific islands paid the price by having parts of their land submerged in water forever. As soon as that happened, the debate that climate change is a myth was completely put to bed, and I would say almost everyone is supportive of ways in which we can make sure our CO2 levels never get to where they used to be. The future is an exciting time. I know that you are probably worried about what is coming next but just know, as soon as other people fully realized what you already know about the climate crisis, things begin to take a turn for the better.

An optimistic message from 2060                                      <br><br>

Dear 2020,                                      <br><br>

     Although you are all currently scared about the COVID-19 I want to offer you solace, as it will be the greatest blessing in disguise. I believe you are all in the month of March currently. In the coming months you will see the greatest reduction of emissions since 60 years past. Whole countries banned transportation and essentially quarantined their citizens. Although being stuck and home, unable to travel, and seemingly brought to a halt by this virus is throwing your society into a panic, it is actually helping the planet a whole lot. 
Everyone started to buy less of things that were not necessary such as excessive clothing. In 2020 fast fashion slowed down tremendously because there was no reason to show off outfits and possessions when we were all at home. The sweatshops in countries like India were shut down because they were no longer profitable. 
Trips to the grocery store became less frequent so letting food go to waste was looked down on. People quit throwing away food that was still good. Leftovers were valuable when you didn't know the next time you'd be able to go buy more food. There was a scarcity of toilet paper for a long time too. People realized that those in panic would keep buying it all. This was obviously wasting a lot of trees. Then some smart individuals came up with the idea of using treated recycled water in bidets to clean genitalia without needing toilet paper. Bidets were already used in other countries but they became very popular in America after the coronavirus. 
The air travel industry took a tremendous hit that it couldn't bounce back from. Flights would get canceled because not enough people could fill the planes. It became very unpredictable. As a result, flying was no longer considered a desirable avenue for transportation. People stayed local and bought local so that the virus would not spread and this helped curb emissions too. Many people resulted to having at home gardens and living in micro communities so that they could maintain social distance long enough for the virus to run its course. People felt happy and healthier with their new diets and didn't see the need for mass agriculture or the meat industry. We vote with our dollar and our votes just weren't cast towards meat production any more. 
You can't see it yet but today, in 2060, the world is a whole lot greener. After the worst stock market crash since 1987, many Americans felt that we would slip into another depression. Americans were losing jobs because the consumer culture could not be sustained after people no longer placed value on superficial items. People quit going to malls, movies, and amusement parks. America used to rely on consumer culture to flourish but in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, America realized in order to sustain its economic success it would need to focus its economy on something other than consumer goods and material items. To combat this the President who was elected in 2020 decided to follow the footsteps of the past President Roosevelt and created a new WPA in 2021. This President was also in favor of the green new deal which already had a proposed plan for increasing jobs while phasing out fossil fuels. Although the past WPA(1935) worked on building roads, schools, and dams, this new WPA focused on building green infrastructure such as bike lanes, wind turbines, and renewable energy sources. As a result, cars virtually phased out and so did fossil fuels. Today we bike everywhere. 
Job availability in Environmental Science flourished as well. Movements towards outlawing HFCs gained ground. The sciences were pushed hard in schools and we realized that we needed “all hands on deck” so girls were encouraged to study the sciences. Because those women became educated, they became advocates for other women around the world. Women everywhere were all given at least primary education by the year 2040. Many women decided to continue their education since social stigmas no longer inhibited their ambitions due to men. Subsequently women began having less children and having them later in life. Universal availability of contraception was reached by the year 2045. This along with COVID 19 helped to stabilize the population and it still has not risen above 8.5 billion. 
As you can see, an unpredictable virus had a domino effect in helping our planet finally take control of our emissions and be mindful of the way we were living.  Trust the process.
Good luck as it all plays out,

To preface this letter, I would just like to say that I really learned a lot in this class and that I was glad to be able to be surrounded by people who also wanted to fight the climate crisis. Something that really speaks to me is being able to fix the society we live in so that we can make the world a genuinely better place. Seeing people all around the world suffering for the mistakes that us as bigger countries have caused is something that I very strongly want to resolve. I can’t stand by and watch as those who don’t have a voice get bullied around while others just sit back and watch as this horror just unfolds. As the quote goes, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The power of privilege is not something that we normally think about, but it is always there and it is in our best interests to negate it. In the future, I truly hope that the world will get better and I feel optimistic about it because the current generation is doing all that we can to save our planet. I believe that we can call each other to action and that we can do whatever it takes in order to keep the planet habitable. The following letter will be addressed to anyone and its contents will describe earth in the year 2060 in a more optimistic light.
                                     <br><br>

To whom this may concern,
                                     <br><br>

It’s the year 2060 and the world has become a much better place than it was back in 2020. There have been so many changes all around the world and it all lead to the world being in the best state it has been in a very long time, but let me just start from the very beginning.
                                     <br><br>

In 2020, I was just a normal college student living his day to day life and had decided to take ENGL 23 thinking that it was just going to be an easy GE that I could mindlessly get through. In reality, this was a class that to me, became very engaging and something that I could take part in. I began to take action closer to the end of the quarter where the readings and the lectures became much more about what we can do instead of what will happen if we don’t do anything. Learning about all the alternative actions that I could take motivated me to change my lifestyle in order to live a better life. The first action that I took to reduce my carbon footprint was cut out beef from my diet. The reason for this was that there are too many places around the world getting run over due to livestock and I wanted to start with the most prevalent source before moving down the list. I convinced most of my friends to make the switch to stop eating beef and as the movement spread on, dining commons began to serve less beef which showed that anyone can truly make an impact. I decided that I couldn’t completely go vegetarian but I could switch to a more largely plant based diet of which Ken pressed us to do. In doing so, and convincing those around me to do the same, we were able to change dining commons so that they would serve protein powerful vegetables all the while reducing their own carbon footprint.
                                     <br><br>

Although it may seem that what we did was very significant, there was still much more work to go through. We needed to do something about what the school itself should do to reduce its
                                     <br><br>
carbon footprint. By switching to more efficient lights and electronics, we are able to reduce the carbon footprint. We also have switched to more alternatives for energy instead of relying on fossil fuels so much. Soon after, bikes started to become much more prevalent and this in turn led to the increased laying down of bike paths. One year later, the current president called to action the Green New Deal in order to take action of what needed to be done in order to save our planet. He proposed drastic changes that were necessary in order keep our earth habitable. Some of these included reducing the amount of cars per household to only one and production of more public transit. Many people around the world were appalled at this decision and began to slander the name of the president, but this was something that was necessary in order to change the state of our planet. Because I had already prepped for this, it wasn’t too hard to switch on my account. Both at school and at home, I began to ride bikes around more and the city’s council members decided that we should make everything closer and thus began the conversion of our suburban area into a more city like area. All around the world, communities were becoming more city-like for the convenience of it. New York was deemed as a model to depict what a city would look like but only for its layout. 
                                     <br><br>

All around the world, planes usage decreased until it became 0 and methods of long distance travel became primarily boats for international and trains for domestic. The slow travel movement began to thrive and this in turn led to increased happiness as people were able to spend more time with the people that they love and share a much more enjoyable experience. In America, however, many people were disgusted by the fact that they weren’t allowed to travel faster but what was done was necessary. Slowly, but surely the fact that public transit was so accessible began to grow on Americans and this led to them appreciating it much more. Being able to spend more quality with the people that they love increased the levels of happiness in America. Local leaders began pressuring for more in order to combat the climate crisis that was approaching if we didn’t do more as this was still not enough, we needed to completely stop the usage of fossil fuels. Everyone began to realize the importance of voting and this started a chain reaction of increased climate activism. 5 years later, fossil fuel plants no longer existed and this was a major milestone towards reducing the worldwide carbon emissions. 
                                     <br><br>

In 2060, the world is the best it's been, but there are still things that can be accomplished to make the world an even better place. Relations around the world are peaceful and unemployment rates are at an all time low. There are still people who want to revert back to the usage of fossil fuels, but their numbers are low and they are slowly learning to integrate themselves into the world. Food is locally sourced and transportation emits very low carbon levels due to the fact that public transit is the main mode of getting around. Everyone around the world is living a much more minimalistic life because they know that having things they really don’t need is something that isn’t really helping the planet. Something that resonated with me while I was in ENGL 23 was a line that said helping the planet should be an act of kindness and that we shouldn’t really expect anything in return except that we will be able to live on this planet.

<p>

 In 2060 I hope that you made a change to your diet, decided to recycle more, and began looking for a smaller place to live. In all honestly you don’t need all the luxuries that the U.S. constantly advertises to you. Simple sustainable living is truly the best to save the planet. Think not only about yourself but your family and especially you kids and grandchildren. You should think about giving them the best future they can have environmentally. The generations before us set your generation behind in terms of the environment. Right now if your generation doesn’t change your children and grandchildren probably won’t have an earth to live on or, if they do, it has been partially been partially destroy and is unlivable. I want you to continue trying to be environmentally conscious and remember what happened with the generations before you. 
                                     <br><br>

 I am picturing the future as a beautiful place with very low emissions and more environmentally conscious people. Your generation is happy because they save the planet so to speak. Most people live on an environmentally conscious diet and there are laws in place protecting life and the planet from reaching a level of emissions that would be bad for us. The weather is not as bad as it once was. There is rain and things like hurricanes and tornadoes are not as strong as they once were. People are genuinely happy and we have learned to help those suffering from starvation and a lack of housing. Food is not being wasted in the U.S. as it once was but instead people are putting in an effort to save food from waste and redistributing it to those in need. All in all I hope you, your family, and the environment are truly well. Love you.

Dear future me,                                      <br><br>

This is the year 2020. Me, a 18 years old freshman in UCSB, is writing a letter to you and trying to express my thought and expectation about climate change and tell you how i started my road of protecting environment. I am now imaging your reaction while you are reading this letter and i hope it to be gratified instead of being pity. I am now taking a course named ENGL 23 AKA Climate Crisis 101 and the course is almost done. In the last quarter which is the end of 2019, i took the Engl22 course as well. To be honest, the original intention of me taking this course is not for the interest of climate change. But i have to admit that this course did successfully raise my attention on environmental problems and help me realized how important it is. I can say this is the start of my road to protect environment.
                                     <br><br>


Before 2020, precisely the end of 2019, i don’t have clearly concept of the environmental problems the earth is facing especially climate change. What i know is that this thing is harmful for environment but it’s so unreal to me as i was born in a world which is already harmed and i haven’t notice a visible change on environment as i was too young to put attention on this. What’s more, i was clear that my personal action won’t make any difference on climate and i don’t even know if others will help protect the earth. So, i always do things in my way for comfort and convenience.
                                     <br><br>


After taking this course. I started to realize how severe the climate change is and how urgent taking action is. I started to have deep thinking about the environment. I started noticing many environment changes and negative consequences around me. All those make me feel that the climate change is being so close and so real to me. Actually in 2019, i have noticed the continually hot weather in my home country especially my city. Even in the winter, the time i should wear down coats in the past, i can just wear a t-shirt when i am going outside. Until i come back school and take this course, i suddenly realized it is definitely the bad consequences of CO2 emission. Especially when i was having a video call with my family members lived in my home country, i saw they were still wearing t-shirt, which remind me of the severe of climate change. The other thing is the wild fire .in Santa Barbara named cave fire which happened in my first quarter in UCSB. As a freshman in US, it’s the first time for me to witness a wildfire. I can’t imagine how i was feeling at that time. I think it’s more like unbelievable and i was truly feeling scared. I can feel the temperature was rising because of the fire while i was walking on the street. I can see the wildfire on the top of the mountain through the window of my classroom. There was emergency alerts popping out on my phone screen instantly and making harsh alarm. Those made me feel nervous and scary. It’s the first time i feel the scare of the climate change caused by human action.
                                     <br><br>


During the learning of the course, i have the chance to know more disasters caused by climate change, watch many documents and films about environment, see many astonishing data and have a deeper understanding of many aspect of climate change like the personal actions, policies, inequity issue and so on. I started to be clear about what i can do to help and i have gradually change my mind. So, 2020 is the year i started to change my diet from having more meat to having more plant-based food. I considered this to be the hardest transition for me as i am a person who really love eating meat and eating a lot of food! As for now, i haven’t finish this shift on my diet habit but i am still working on it. I know you are now living in a house which is just right for you and your family. I used to imagine me to live in a big house like a queen as i think i would work hard to earn lots of money. But now, i realize large house doesn’t mean i will be happy. With a large emission of Co2 that cause harm on environment, large house means nothing. 

                                     <br><br>

My exception for the future environment and the human efforts is not that positive. As for now, there’s still large amount of skepticisms don’t believe climate change and also many people doubting it.  With those contradiction, the appeal for environmental protection will not be as successful as we imagine. Making people to have consensus on saving environment is the most important thing beyond started taking action. It’s the prerequisite. And then, it’s obvious that it will take a long time for human to accept and finish the transit of their mind and habit like their transportation method, their eating habit, the consumerism and so on. Just like the garbage sorting, which is a popular topic in the past years and took a long time to make everyone accept this concept and make this to be their habit. And according to the Green New Deal, government still have much work to do to deal with the situation people will face after taking action of cutting CO2 emission. Environment is getting worse and actions are urgently needed. But i don’t think we are in the process of taking actions at least in 2020, let alone it needs much works to do. In my opinion, the harm we caused on the environment especially climate change is irreversible. What we can do now is just to do our best to reduce the harm we caused on the earth. At least in my lifetime, the environment won’t be better than now. Though, when you are reading this letter, the situation must be getting better. I believe in 2060, all people will live in a healthy and environmental-friendly life for their own will and saving the earth instead of the imperative provisions. All people will fight against climate change and fight for their next generation instead of leaving stress to their offsprings. And people will be living in a brand new environmental-friendly social system. 

                                     <br><br>

Although there might be some unavoidable damage happen in the future because of the continually irreversible develop which might probably disappointed you, it’s never too late to take action. Just keep doing the right thing!

A lot has changed in the fight to save our planet over the past 40 years since 2020.
                                     <br><br>

It all started with the outbreak of COVID-19. Although not necessarily connected to the climate crisis, its effects on the world helped everyone realize not only how fragile our Earth was, but the fundamental flaws within how our society operates. After the virus's spread became uncontrollable, mass travel restrictions were put and place and everyone was urged to stay home and avoid public spaces. There was not a car, plane, train, or bus in sight. Within weeks, the air was cleaner, the smog lingering over city's like L.A. and Beijing had largely disappeared. The trash and pollution left by the flocks of tourists that used to travel en mass was no more.  It was a change people noticed and took appreciation for. Secondly, people began to realize the value of minimalism and the problems of mass consumerism. Seeing the chaos taking place at supermarkets with fights breaking out over trivial/unnecessary items, people were shocked by how savage like they had become due to their almost mindless obsession with buying things. After the initial panic spree of buying, people saw the value in owning only a few necessary things instead and maintaining and caring for it. The excess waist created by consumable items that went into landfills had significantly decreased. This was all a temporary glimpse into the future in which we aren't fossil fuel dependent and cared for the world; our home.
                                     <br><br>

The pandemic also brought about a great time of unity. Everyone was equally affected regardless of the wealth, race, religions, etc. At the state level, partisanship in government was largely diminished as both sides of the isle actively worked together in order to help prevent further spread and provide care to all those that needed it. Globally, governments who previously had quarrels between each other united under the cause of stopping the virus once and for all. It was this era of good deed that continued after a vaccine was found for COVID-19, which brought the world closer together and redirected its goals towards making the world a better place. Seeing how the governments of the world initially failed to take early action on the spread of the virus, many saw a similar correlation with our resistance towards taking early action towards climate change. The support for the climate change reversal agenda grew significantly world wide as the side effects of fighting the virus showed a sign of a healing Earth. The Green New Deal was looked into again, and the Republican Party reconsidered their position on Climate change. Nearly a year after the end of COVID-19, the Green New Deal was signed into law.
                                     <br><br>

Ever since 2022, temperatures have began to decrease as well as the sea levels and animal extinction rate. Because of the lesson learned from the COVID-19 pandemic about needing to take action early, changes progressed faster than the Green New Deal expected. By 2040, our economy and country as a whole had completely switched to sustainable sources, thus reaching zero carbon emissions. It was now cool and hip to eat green, and public transportation was even more preferred than private travel. Airplanes were no longer in the sky as Hyper Loop systems carried people from one end of the U.S. to the other in faster times than what air travel previously boasted about. And finally City life was cheaper, more clean, and generally much more appealing. Co-housing was no longer only popular with the younger generation as everyone of all walks of life enjoyed this new way of living.
                                     <br><br>

Although it took a hard lesson to be learned, it ultimately made not only our society, but most importantly us humans more responsible for our planet and how we treat it..

I am writing to you from the year 2020. This year has already presented some great challenges: the uproar of a new virus, a fiery election, the unexpected death of a beloved and iconic basketball star. In the midst of all this tension, I took the Climate Crisis course at UCSB. Towards the beginning of this class, I felt very conflicted. Ken made a strong point to outline the severity of global warming. At first I felt extremely hopeless- as if the world was crumbling. The news is inundated with horrible occurrences, and also the planet is failing? What more could go wrong? However, after continuing on, I saw a dramatic twist in the course of the class. Ken began to offer so many different ways and methods to alleviate this issue. I was in pure shock, especially because I had complete and utter control of all these things.
                                     <br><br>

While I considered myself a pescetarian before class, I now like to call myself a climatarian. This usually sparks wonderful conversation between those around me- even inspiring others to change their actions! Being a climatarian is by no means hard. It is choosing peanut butter over almond butter, or lentils instead of a burger. I have also cut transportation by cars completely out of my life. From now on, I will bike and use public transportation. I try my best every day to make earth-conscious decisions. I know that as a young adult, the difference I make will start a chain reaction with others around me. I have never considered myself very politically active, but after this course I completely advocate voting. Voting is a way to create greater change within a personal community and in the whole world. 
                                     <br><br>
I am writing to you because I hope that as you grow older you continue to make these decisions. A lot of pressure comes with being an adult, and after watching so many documentaries, I have learned that wealth and materialism is not the key to happiness. I hope you live in a micro-apartment and continue to practice being a climatarian. I hope the voting you did as a young adult with your peers really made a difference. I hope that people around you took the climate crisis seriously in the past 40 years. 

                                     <br><br>
It’s hard to make attitude and behavior changes, but at this cost, it is worth it. In Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the biggest base is at the bottom and includes physiological needs: food, health, sex, etc. At the top comes creativity, morality, and acceptance of facts. I think that people need to treat the planet like this. A planet that can aid the chaos of unexpected death, deadly illnesses, and disagreement must be healthy. In order to do this people need to make smarter decisions and seriously come together to fix the climate crisis.
                                     <br><br>

I hope you will witness that and take part in it yourself,

In the year 2020, I gave up eating meat, bit by bit. I started with beef, because it had the largest environmental impact, and then pork, and the chicken and fish. Eventually, I stopped using animal products altogether. I was at first a Avi-pescatarian, then a vegetarian, then a vegan, but the larger title I identified with this shift was “Climatarian”. As much as I had shuddered watching live fish in food tanks in big markets choking on top of each other, the reason I made the shift to avoid using animal products was larger than just the suffering of those animals, it was to minimize the mass suffering of every animal and human on earth.
                                     <br><br>

Also in 2020, Donald Trump was re-elected president of my country. I personally campaigned against him, joining student groups and local campaigns, as well as raising voting awareness in my community. I showed up to vote, along with millions of young people nationally, but it wasn’t enough. A climate change denier got 4 more years in office, and despite rising tides, lengthening droughts, fires and hurricanes, continuing scientific verification of every trend towards climate destruction, he never listened. He was a climate change denier until he died of a heart attack in 2029.
                                     <br><br>

It wasn’t until the late 20’s that we started taking the national action on climate change that we needed, and we took it far too slowly. National air policies were enacted, a carbon tax was put in place, and fossil fuel was phased out - a lot of necessary policies were finally being enacted, but they still protected the rich and powerful, still granted privilege to the same people who had caused the crisis. By then, I had been writing protest poetry and cli-fi stories for years. I got my big break in 2031, and wrote a book that got national attention and was turned into a screenplay - a thinly veiled metaphor for the climate injustice of the world we lived in. With a louder voice, I had the opportunity to advocate, and walk my talk, choosing video publicity over book tours and donating my unneeded profits to activist organizations. 
                                     <br><br>

An international momentum had finally gathered by the early 30’s. Greta Thunberg had taken the responsibility of heading up a powerful coalition of environmental groups that all united behind a single vision for a clean and stable earth, and with the heaviest popular support for any national initiative in recent history. The definition of radical and moderate had shifted - radical was tearing down the oil rigs armed to the teeth, moderate was doing it on the government’s schedule. Once change started, it couldn’t happen fast enough to keep up with public demand. It shifted in a single decade from zero change to all the change possible. Responsible republican voices were among the most important aspects of this shift, guiding their own party towards reason and a desire to protect their families and the future of their nation.
                                     <br><br>

When I was 58, I remember being hopeful about the future of the earth again for the first time. My daughter gave birth to her biological child, something I had never had the optimism to do. I brought the warmest, snuggliest purple blanket for them, and watched the sun set through the lobby window with a big smile. I read my grandchild my newest book, a picture book I made about my stuffed bear, the same one I had given to my daughter, and the same one my daughter gave to her child. It was a bear that had once brought me unadulterated joy, and I hoped it would do the same for my grandchild, a little human who felt only the majestic and mystery of a mythical creature, like a dragon, and none of the loss I felt when I remembered how I had once seen a real bear, off of the small road to Yosemite.
                                     <br><br>

And now it is 2060. Today is March 25th, and tomorrow is my birthday. I have a family to celebrate with, and I have fresh air to breathe. I never thought I would be alive this long or this happily. But I’ve fought for each and every breath, and I’m going to damn well enjoy it. I wanted to make my journal entry today about remembering, what we had to do together to get here. I wanted to remember how hard I had to fight to meet my grandchild Jace, and how easily it could have gone the other way. God am I grateful. If anyone from the past could hear my thoughts now, I would just want to tell them it will be ok. It will be good, but only if they fight for it.

Dear Future Self:
                                      <br><br>

 This is the message from yourself in 2020. I hope you can still see this message by chance. The 2020’s Yuke is pessimistic. After taking ENGL 23 at UCSB, after seeing all the shocking statistics, you felt there is no future for humans. The time goes quickly, you had heard climate change since your elementary school, but everything was going worse and worse. Every time when you tried to act, you felt hopeless, since only you did it and the rest people were still the same. I don’t know if you keep the climate crisis in mind now, but I hope your answer is yes. The scientists said the North Pole will iceless in 2040, did that become real? If not, maybe everyone was putting effort into it. Did you remember your ENGL 23’s professor Ken? The most frequent thing he said was changing the food diet. I don’t believe you change to vegan or vegetarian since you love meat so much, but hope you eat less (you need to lose weight). As I wrote this letter, the 2020 president of the US was still a secret. Did democrat took back the power and did they pass the Green New Deal (if you remember what it is)? Hope they did, because Republicans like fossil fuel so much and they need money…

                                     <br><br>

 I had commented on ENGL 23 about the idea of moving to cities, I said instead of moving to a city, Americans need to create cities. Did they improve public transportations? Right now, the time I wrote the letter, I still suffer America’s poor public transportation - I had waited for the bus over 30 mins. Did they have subways and buses everywhere? Or did they have highspeed railways between each city and state? I believe creating cities is the only way to solve the housing and transportation problem, but who knows. Maybe when you look at this message, you thought I was naive and there are other new options in your time. Hope the US already solved those problems. 

                                     <br><br>

 Oh, I wonder are humans successfully achieve the goal of saving the planet? Or are humans defeated by environments (actually by humans themselves)? Though from my perspective, from a person in 2020, it is hard to save the planet, there is still a chance. I wish you are not suffering, and I wish you are enjoying the beautiful weather. If you guys do win the fight, tell me the differences between now and the past. Does everyone reject to use fossil fuel right now? Does carbon tax become real? What about China? What are the differences between the US and China when they fight against the climate crisis? By the way, did you go back to China or stay in the US for the future? Either is good. Still, I hope you are living well. If not, I must be sad.

In 2020, my little cousin Lisa was born. She was born into a happy family near Cincinnati, Ohio, and she had a bright future and I was so excited for her to make her way in the world. It would have been nice if we gave her a world to go into. The same year, Donald Trump was unsurprisingly re-elected as president of the United States since younger voters, as usual, chose not to vote. Older voters, who had less concern for the climate crisis since their lives would be less affected by it, saw no urgency to vote for candidates who promoted radical environmental precautions.

In 2030, we lost the last coral reef to coral bleaching. Increased ocean acidification and temperatures killed them all. Almost all kids have no memory or understanding of coral reefs. This year, developing countries with booming populations resorted to using cheap oil to fund their huge energy needs. Most developed countries had transitioned to renewables, with the major exception of the U.S.A., which was still largely fossil based.
                                     <br><br>
 In 2035, mosquitos were reproducing at 100x the rate they were in 2010, and malaria became a widespread issue throughout North America. It overwhelmed the U.S. healthcare system, which 10 years ago struggled to stop COVID-19, and many people died as a result of lack of access to emergency care. For years, many Americans clamored for a universal healthcare system that would be paid for through income taxes, but it never was approved in Congress, and prices for prescription drugs and general healthcare benefits rose dramatically.
                                     <br><br>
 In 2045, people all over the world were living in air that was deemed extremely unsafe by WHO standards. The number of deaths attributed to smog skyrocketed, and Los Angeles residents could no longer go outside without their oxygen masks. Additionally, hundreds of millions of people died as a result of famine in Australia, Africa, and the Middle East.
                                     <br><br>
 By 2050, areas near the equator were largely unlivable. A significant percentage of the world’s population gained the term climate refugees, due to circumstances not limited to but including unlivable temperatures, sea level rise, and war due to food and oil shortages. Europe and the U.S. became overwhelmed by refugees, struggling with how to fit them in areas already burdened by overpopulation.
                                     <br><br>
 And now, in 2060, as you watch this lecture, you know that schools across the world have had to move classes online, as outdoor travel is completely unsafe with the high temperatures and dangerous air quality. And yes, my generation knew all of this was going to happen. We knew what we had to do to stop it. But we didn’t do anything. And now you will pay the price for us.

The year is 2060. I am babysitting my only grandchild. He’s a little boy and we are walking to school. I had one child and so did my daughter. Not a car, a bus, or a plane in sight. Schools have been closing left and right as there are less children than ever before. I retired from my job as an engineer where I worked on constructing railroad tracks. The number of trains has exponentially grown. There is much more funding being placed towards city planning. City planning has allowed for the community to be almost entirely solar powered. 
                                     <br><br>

My daughter works as a doctor. She is a gynocolygist who helps promote the sustainable idea of only having one child. For this reason, she often performs abortions and inserts forms of birth control into the bodies of women. Her husband works as a teacher in the area. We have spent a lot more time together since the death of my husband last year. He worked in a construction field and tragically died after being electrocuted . The poor man died at the age of 62. 
                                     <br><br>

As we walk to school, I tell my son about how different it used to be. His closet is not filled with clothes from Forever 21 or Zara, like mine once was. He has a quarter of the amount of clothes his mom had, who had a quarter of the amount that I had. I told him about a time where there were as many cars on the road as there were people. I tell him about a time where you would be praised for being one of the few that rode a bike to work. We laugh about the Coronavirus which completely shook our world. I tell him that it happened at the same time I was taking this Climate Crisis class. He asks, “what is a Climate Crisis.” 
                                     <br><br>

At that moment, I think, “Damn. We have done it.” We actually put a stop to something so horrible. It started with the small changes of changing light bulbs, changing our diet, and changing what we wear. We began to vote for the right people and move to the right cities. With the new people elected we were able to put new initiatives into action. This included a carbon tax that completely reduced the amount of carbon emissions. Fast fashion is no longer a thing. People began to buy what they need not what they want. Driving? Ha. That is funny. Once the carbon tax was put into place it went from cars to buses and now trains. My poor grandchild will never experience the joy of a drivers license. He also won’t enjoy the luxuries of many candies as companies have stopped incorporating palm oil into their recipes. Long live Australia. 
                                     <br><br>

Now, what was the climate change, Charlie? It was a period where the future of the world was in the hands of pretty much Americans. Every other county has been taking steps to avoid the inevitable. It was a time when we had to step up to the plate. We finally did it when Biden was president. We couldn’t waste anymore time. After the COVID-19 and the recession passed, the world was eager to do something. Charlie can now thank god he doesn’t know what the climate crisis is. The world has cooled substantially for the better.

2020 was such a stressful year for you but you will survive even if everything feels like it's falling apart. Everything was uncertain in personal and public life: your UCSB classes, the climate change issue, the Presidential election, the coronavirus and what job/internships to apply for. Your second year at UCSB was supposed to be the best year but everything went downhill in the winter quarter. Even just a couple months into 2020, you already know how significant this year is for your life and the rest of the state. You began your Winter quarter by taking Climate 101 and were educated on the urgency of the climate change crisis. Remember how you thought changing to a plant-based diet would not last for too long? Thankfully, you followed through with your promises to do your part for the environment. You went from reducing your meat consumption to eliminating any meat and dairy in your diet. At the time, it was a lot of work not only to follow it but also to ignore the comments from the Tias. You should know that I am much healthier now in my old age because of that decision we took. Our family is healthier because of the diet and are well educated on the impact it has on the environment. In the long run, this class had a significant impact on the amount of stuff you bought, like the house Matt and I are growing old in. 
                                     <br><br>

Learning about the impacts of the climate crisis that Winter was a good way to foreshadow what was to come to California. The following summers, it got even hotter and it made people feel trapped. In Salinas, we thought we were safe since we were close enough to the ocean. But the ocean levels rose to alarming rates that people were scrambling to relocate. It was sad to say a lot of our acquaintances fell into hard times because many could not afford to move away. We worked hard to move somewhere safer but it is sad to see a lot of our favorite places in Monterey are now gone. It is unsafe to go near the place you are living in now in IV because of the erosion of the cliffs that got worse over time. I urge you to go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium one more time, I know you are probably tired of it now but you should take in the beauty of all these marine animals that will be gone in a couple of years. Let me tell you what led up to their extinction. 
                                     <br><br>

Unfortunately, the 2020 election was not won by who we hoped, Bernie Sanders. Once again, not enough young people showed up to the polls. We suffered another four years but it was our environment that suffered the most. Trump finally got his way to opening up the Monterey Bay sanctuary for offshore drilling, Organizations like Oceana and the Monterey Bay aquarium could no longer fight it and this lead to a destruction of marine life. This is why I urge you to visit the sea otters exhibits you love to go watch. So much more happened but I do not want to drown you with negativity. Continue playing your part, implement everything you have learned in your climate class and educate those around you before it's too late.

40 years ago the world was in chaos. I know both of you know about the Coronavirus pandemic that broke out because your mother and I lived through it, but there was an issue bigger and more long term at hand going on. We called it the climate crisis. 
                                     <br><br>


As most people knew about this issue regarding weather, natural disasters and the melting of the ice caps, not everyone believed in it. Before arriving at UCSB as an undergrad, I believed in it but didn't exactly know why. I wanted to become more informed about the issue in an educational setting, so I took an English class entitled Literature and the Environment during my first quarter at UCSB. The literature part of the class was okay but what I really enjoyed were climate Fridays, where the entire lecture focused on the more scientific side of climate change and what we could do about it. By the end of the quarter in December 2018, I realized it turned out to be my favorite class, surprisingly. The professor mentioned that the following year he would offer a class that revolved more around the content he discussed during climate Fridays that I enjoyed so much. This excited me. I made a note in my phone to take the class, although it wasn't offered for over a year.

                                     <br><br>

Fast forward to January 2020, and I was enrolled in this new climate class that Ken taught. I enjoyed this course even more than English 22. I learned more in-depth statistics about the climate crisis, how much of a threat it was, and several ways that I could combat climate change. I remember at the beginning of the course feeling pessimistic about the world's future because of how little most people/countries in the world were doing to limit greenhouse gas emissions, but by the end, I felt confident that saving the world was something that could be catalyzed by adopting the Green New Deal, the first comprehensive climate plan ever in the United States.

                                     <br><br>

It took several years for the US to formally act on making several big changes to forego greenhouse gas emissions in almost every way shape and form, but the 2024 presidential election really kickstarted the Green New Deal initiative. With a Democrat as president and California being a leader in converting to renewable energy and an efficient mass transit system, the whole country was operating as I had hoped it would be by the 2030s. 

                                     <br><br>

With the United States taking such a monumental step in combatting the Climate Crisis, other world leaders soon followed. India and China began drastically changing what resources they used and minimized the area of land to use for agriculture. And after a few decades, it's truly a dream come true to see that every country on the planet has banned unsustainable energy.
                                     <br><br>


Any questions, kids?

Dear children, 
                                     <br><br>

I am writing this letter in 2060 to hopefully explain why we are facing this threat that may affect our climate yet again. After the 2020 elections, there was a long era of a Democratic majority in our government. This change influenced the rhetoric of climate change as many voices in the government were finally acknowledging that the climate crisis was immediate and because of its economic and political influence globally, the U.S. needed to be a catalyst for change internationally. Growing up during this era (I was 16 in 2020), I experienced both the culture before and after the government started implementing ideas from the green new deal. In 2022, the United Nations came together and unlike the 2015 Paris Agreement, came up with a system of carbon fees for each nation who signed. The 2022 Carbon Emission Agreement capped the GHG emissions at a specific number for each nation, applied fees and repercussions for not keeping emissions under the cap, and came up with tangible solutions and goals for the nations (particular to their current situation) that they could implement immediately.  
                                     <br><br>

The U.S. government took this seriously. In its early years of the re-election, there was still debate on whether or not climate change was a priority for the nation. But in 2021 and 2022, the U.S. began experiencing the consequences of ignoring climate change. Florida’s coastline started corroding and flooding more and more, pushing whole towns to relocate; New York and California experienced their hottest summers on record which destroyed crops and made wearing a suit to commute to work impossible, and the droughts experienced nationwide caused major fires that became uncontrollable. Finally, the public could no longer ignore that the climate crisis was present and needed immediate action. 
                                     <br><br>

So, the U.S. government used the Carbon Emission Agreement as a guideline to restructure many dominant systems. Carbon fees were implemented in our economy (starting small then increased as we adjusted), more communal housing structures replaced bigger, single family homes, and agriculture reform legislations that restricted what and how much of certain crops/livestock could be farmed passed. The changes started small but started to change our society in major ways. 
                                     <br><br>

Now with those changes, we are living healthier, happier, and longer lives. But, with the concerning results of 2060 reelections producing a republican majority in the government, there is a fear of the new president possibly retracting from the 2022 Carbon Emission Agreement. The new president’s campaign did mention how the agreement is (1) no longer needed to be implemented in our country as the climate crisis we experienced in 2020 is no longer as serious of a threat to our livelihood and therefore no longer a priority and (2) claims that our economy needs to thrive to make U.S. a major economic power again. 
                                     <br><br>

We are waiting to see what will happen in the next coming months. But, I wanted to express that there is hope. We have revolutionized before in the name of climate change and I have faith that we will do it again if we need to. It saddens me deeply that we are experiencing this threat once again in my lifetime, but I will do whatever I need to again to secure your healthy and happy future. Whatever happens, I ask you to be strong, stand for what you believe in, and fight for your future. 
                                     <br><br>

Love always 
                                     <br><br>

A message from the future:                                     <br><br>

To whom this may concern,
                                     <br><br>

It's the year 2060. The government has finally realized that we were right in the past and have started taking change. Since the planet has already taken too much damage, the government has taken huge steps into reversing what we have done. A step they've taken in reduce CO2 emissions is completely banning fossil fuel companies. These companies had strength over the government for too long. The truth about how climate change was discovered from a scientist from an oil company was revealed and activists convinced the government to shut down fossil fuel companies. 
                                     <br><br>


Mass producing cows have become limited and methane release into the air is slowly declining causing vegan-friendly restaurants to become more prevalent. Scientists have figured out how to make food that tastes identical to meat and as a result, many restaurants have switched to that alternative. Cars have also been switched to electric cars and charging stations charge high prices to encourage the use of public transportation. Solar powered houses have slowly started to begin being  installed into homes. 
                                     <br><br>


The Green New Deal has been implemented and changes are finally taking place. While everything has not been implemented yet, change is happening for the better.
                                     <br><br>
Sincerely,
                                     <br><br>

 It gave me a lot to think about                                      <br><br>

But I have a few questions,                                      <br><br>
                                     <br><br>

In this future what is the climate like considering that its been 40 years of complacency and then drastic actions? 
                                     <br><br>


Would the actions you define be enough to undo the damage?

                                     <br><br>

Would you be comfortable living in your sixties in a society that has only just realized the damage done to the climate? What would be your personal reaction to 40 years of no change and then a sudden move to rectify the situation when you were 60?

                                     <br><br>

Personally, I think this situation is beyond saving especially if we continue at our current rate of consumption and if that consumption is exported to developing countries then I don't think we have a snowflakes chance in the desert,.

Currently during the creation of this document, it is the year 2060. The purpose behind the writing of this piece is simple; meaning to look upon a critical year of the past: 2020. Not many years can be so decisively seen as turning points in history. The few that come up off the top of my head usually relate to critical ventures in countries, such as the beginning of the American Nation in 1776. However, 2020 was special as it not only marked a change for a country's system, but on a global scale, both politically and environmentally. Leading up to the marked year in America, it was a tumultuous time as the future of the planet was being put to the wayside due to the capitalistic culture. The American political leaders going into 2020 were markedly against confronting the climate crisis. However, that did not stop the rest of the world from seeing the enormity of the situation at hand. The planet was hurting due to the repercussions of the environmentally harmful acts of the past; the time delay was over and the damage was exponentially increasing. The world was crying for help and yet the self-proclaimed "greatest nation in the world" was not responding, letting other countries take the forefront. Thankfully, these countries were able to set a better example in confronting the crisis at hand until the American people forced their leaders to respond by removing those who opposed the address of the climate crisis.
                                     <br><br>



The change had started from the bottom up as more and more people in the American public realized the enormity of the climate calamity. Younger people that were aware of the lack of proper education regarding climate change made a substantive effort in changing the minds of others, particularly those of the older generations. They encouraged teaching more about the reality of the climate in schools across all levels of education while also producing a large amount of resources through the means of discourse that they had. They also started producing forms of media and film that addressed the effects of climate change locally in order to convince the locals that the climate needed to be addressed immediately. This focus on local change allowed for an exponential increase in support of confronting the climate crisis locally as the importance of local address was not to be understated. Mass media took a more critical stance when it came to coverage of the climate crisis. They realized just how uneducated much of the public were regarding it and also made a substantive effort in changing how they described the crisis. Going from a stance of dual sides with no biases, but rather focusing on that climate change was real and that the crisis was already upon us. Educating the public was the first step for good reason as it allowed for a bevy of change to occur when the majority of people realized that the planet needed our help in order to survive ourselves. 

                                     <br><br>


With that being said, 2020 was not the year of rapid change, but rather the sparking point that lit the match of change that would occur in the following years. This spark allowed for the rescue of the planet from a fate of uninhabitability. If this match was not lit, the world would have gone into despair in a decades time. The warning signs were there, seen in the ever worsening natural disasters, malfunctioning climate, nosediving economy, etc. The world may not have even survived the next five years depending on the unpredictability of the time delayed effects of the climate crisis. We may not have had the world that we love today in 2060. A world that has blossomed beautifully in greater ways than it has been seen in the past 100, 200, or even 500 years. Not since humans were just a tiny little spec on the planet's living population, not even comparable to the large sustainable population of today. Because of the changes in 2020, we are able to live a life without worry, without the stockpiling of resources or people fending for themselves. The world is finally plentiful enough not only for humans, but animals to coexist with each other peacefully and beautifully. Technology and wealth are no longer the priority in people's lives, rather they seek happiness in themselves and others. And to that we must always look upon the year of 2020 and be grateful that the past took the turn that it did.

I am writing from the future which is 40 years ahead of you. I am now in 2060, but you are in 2020. However, the time is not the only difference, and the world is completely distinct. In this letter, I am going to explain what human civilization has achieved and what will happen to our planet from your perspective.



                                     <br><br>

I know that in 2020, the climate crisis was a big thing, and many arguments had been made to better protect our world. I want to tell you that the climate crisis has been resolved at this point, but to maintain the peaceful environment is still our goal. We are still working on preventative works to avoid the environment turns backwards again. In 2060, most people around the world started or are starting to adapt to more environmentally friendly eating habits. This new trend was promoted by college education. Most people become vegans or similar ways. This means that more vegetables are being consumed, and less cows or pigs are reproduced for food. This is a huge step of improvement, a significant amount of carbon is reduced by this. Vegan is the word for fashion now.

                                     <br><br>



We also have revolutionary changes on transportations. Fuel powered cars were gone, we can only see them in the museum. What we can see on the road are electric cars, and they are pretty much similar to the Tesla cars in 2020. However, the new generation cars are maunfact more efficiently, and all the parts on a single car are reusable materials. The other significant difference in 2060 is that more bike paths are constructed, and they occupy more spaces than the car lanes. 50% of the bikes are electrical powered, and they are allowed to get on the bike highways.

                                     <br><br>



This is what will happen in 2060, please do your best to protect the planet. Please become an activist for the climate crisis. Having a future or not is counting on you and your generations.

Looking back on my college days, much has changed. Back in those days, people still owned cars, and ones that burned gasoline at that! Those were the good old days, but disguised it it was our guilt and ignorance that as we were having a jolly good time, we were destroying the planet too. I graduated UCSB in 2020, 40 years ago. The beginning of that year started off like any other, with celebrations and ski trips. Soon it went to hell as the wildfires in Australia ravaged the countryside, Trump did not get impeached, the legendary basketball player Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash, and of course the outbreak of the pandemic of Corona Virus. The virus was the beginning of the movement to stop eating most animals. Can you believe that the Chinese government endorsed raising animals that are not fit for human consumption? they started out eating wild snakes and rats on farms to have an additional supply of food, but this soon morphed into a meat market with all sorts of animals from all over the world. These imported animals were stored in cages, stacked on top of each other so that shit, piss, and all sorts of other fluids spilled on the animal below. The Corona Virus was believed to come from bats, which transferred the disease to other animals before it spread to humans in meat markets in China. After this worldwide pandemic that wiped out 4% of the population, we outlawed these practices. The world has not seen a pandemic since get out of hand. I'm glad that humans can learn their lessons. In terms of climate, it took a couple years for global north countries, especially here in the US, to really get the picture and change the way we live. It was hard because the American lifestyle is fun. Using so much energy and consuming things is hard to stop. Especially since a lot of people thought that this was their right, living in the US. We eventually changed laws to ban all fossil fuels, and implemented tax on new electric vehicles, while the World ban on air travel was put into effect. I'm writing this to remember the times we once had, long ago. We are so used to our current lifestyle that it doesn't bother anyone to not own a car and eat mainly a plant based diet. Heck, half the people alive today were not even born yet. As the Native American saying goes, think seven generations ahead in every action and decision you make. This could not have ended up being more true, and I urge your kids to implement this into their lives as well. We are living good now, but it has been quite the journey. Sometimes it is nice to look back on the past and remember the mistakes and wins that we have collectively achieved as a species. I hope you do so one day!

Today, your father and I celebrated our 6 month anniversary. As a present for me, he bought me a snake plant suitable for our household conditions. I am not sure how the world is doing now for you, but currently, we are going through a time of panic due to the novel coronavirus that is sweeping across the globe day by day exponentially. This is the conclusion of our 10 week long course on the environmental climate crisis, and throughout these 10 weeks, as a class, we have been educated on so many ways to further develop and improve upon our future. In buying this plant today, we made this conscious effort as well. Instead of flowers, we decided to nurse this plant to life. I hope that this plant is still alive and with us, as a reminder that we can get through it all, whether it be an epidemic or a climate crisis as we all know of. It is our rule to say 10 kind things to the plant every day in hopes that it will give it the encouragement and happiness it needs, as we equally rely on our planet’s healthiness to live. Caring for plants, starting a garden, planting trees- there are just so many ways to reduce our carbon footprint, and if you ever found interest to, there are so many small changes you can make. If your father and I are no longer there to guide you in living a more minimalistic and environmentally friendly way, do not be discouraged in continuing our footsteps, rather carry on what we have started. The biggest takeaway I can feel at this age, is that it is in the small acts that accumulate to big actions. Never let yourself feel your actions make no difference. Just like how we did something small today, we fostered a plant to care for. We want to make the planet better, and we know that action needs to happen immediately, Housing, transportation, population, waste- there are so many things that we can improve upon. Make these efforts with care, and don’t make steps backwards. We want a revolution for the betterment of our society.
                                     <br><br>

Now that it is 2060, I hope that our world has greatly progressed and overcome many difficulties. I hope that I am there with you when you read this. Starting from a few years back when I started educating myself through environmental science classes, I have already made many conscious efforts to improve. Within the next few years, no doubt, there will be yet more improvements, more adaptations, and more changes to come that I will have to face, but someday become accustomed to. I truly wonder, what life will be like for you, but in hopes of a better future, and better world for you to be born under- your parents are working their hardest to provide you a more sustainable and healthy/happier world.

Dear 2060 Self:

                                     <br><br>

The year is 2020, I am 21 years old, and the world is a shit-show. The country is more politically divided than it's ever been in modern political history, and nobody can come together to work on the issues that really matter. Issues that concern climate change and the security of our planet are on the back-burner of political action, since I am living in the era of the Trump administration, where efforts to mitigate climate change are actually being reversed. This year is a pivotal election year, many wonder if we can even afford to endure another conservative term for the global climate's sake. However, in the face of all this information, I'm thankful, because I know I've spent the last few years learning the intricacies of this anthropogenic crisis. In the future, hopefully I will be applying them to global issues as a means to develop solutions that can yield improvements on a large scale. 

                                     <br><br>

But none of this is news to you. This was your life forty years ago, and hopefully things have improved dramatically since today. I hope that people finally came together and opened their eyes to the grim reality of our dying planet, and that the world you live in is a place where children can grow up without having to worry about their children living in an environmental dystopia. 
                                     <br><br>


Not all is bad at the moment though. Sure, this is considered by many historians to be the infamous "coronavirus pandemic," but things are looking pretty optimistic in my eyes. It's not too deadly, thankfully, but we're all taking any precautions we can to stop the spread so it doesn't develop into something much worse. An upside to this pandemic is that its beginning to slow down industrial production, which proves to be great for the climate. China's nitrous oxide levels have dropped exponentially since it began to spread from its epicenter, Wuhan. But I'm sure this halt in production will only last for a little while, since this will probably be resolved within a few months' time. 

                                     <br><br>

I hope that, in your world, the Green New Deal has become a historic passing of policy that finally put the world on the correct path. Hopefully you live in a world where the lights in your house are powered by the wind and the sun, rather than the coal/gas that lead to the deaths of thousands around the globe. Hopefully we all developed some sense of urgency to act rather than sit around and deny the inevitable. I pray that some of the animal species that my generation has come to know and love will still be around in your day, as many have become endangered our extinct due to the negligence of our own species.

                                     <br><br>

If you're around to read this in a sustainable, and healthy world, I will then know that our desperate calls for action finally worked. Our government will have finally come together and worked on bipartisan solutions to this crisis. It will have no longer been a party-based issue, but a human issue. Because if we want to make it to there, it will take everyone's help.

A message from the future:
                                     <br><br>

The current year is 2060. In the late 2020s, the world wised up to the horrors of climate change after a year of fire and our first category 7 hurricane. The world started becoming powered by electricity after the Copenhagen Conference of 2028. More wealthy countries began setting up solar power and batteries for all households, while banding together to help fund solar in less wealthy countries. Solar panels covered entire swaths of desert while reusing and repairing appliances became a growing trend. Unfortunately, not everyone joined in and it lost popularity over time, but by 2040 many new bills had been passed during the Redo era that ban fossil fuels. 
                                     <br><br>


Traditional meat sources were thrown by the wayside as their practices were not sustainable. The lab grown meat industry began to take off and take up the previous meat industry’s mantle. Many people didn’t trust the meat though, so vegetarianism became widespread across the world. Dumps became gold mines as technology increased allowing everything thrown away to be recycled, starting with plastic eating bacteria. Any new forms of production that released large amounts of carbon were also legally mandated

                                     <br><br>

Even with very few carbon emission sources left, the world still continued to heat up. The tropics became unlivable deserts by 2045 while the tropical deserts and rainforests moved up by 5 degrees latitude. There had been no more ice left in the arctic for the past decade, so temperature began rising without stop. People began moving towards the poles at an increasing rate, until in 2050 a team of engineers and biologists invented a piece of biotechnology that was able to extract carbon from the atmosphere at a rapid pace. The rest of the world quickly adopted the invention and a specialized factory lab produced thousands of it. 

                                     <br><br>

In 2056, things finally stabilized, but not before our first category 9 hurricane that killed millions. Traditional housing proved to not be appropriate for the new world we lived in, so most of us headed underground to wait for the world to cool back down. Until that time, we will bide our time underground living through vr to prevent cabin fever from setting in. Now in 2060, some don’t even want to leave vr anymore. Hopefully, the world will cool down before habit sets in for too many.
                                     <br><br>

Hi kiddos.
                                      <br><br>

At this point I am sure I am already at the age of 59, possibly sending you guys to college or watching you make families of your own.  I am writing this in the year 2020 at the age of 18, a small college freshman on a big campus.  As I sit in the last day I will ever be in my dorm room, 2323, listening to low-fi with my friends as we do work, I am burdened by a heavy heart.  Just a couple of days ago we found out that the global pandemic of COVID-19 has forced our campus at UCSB to go entirely online during Spring Quarter.  I remember getting the email, feeling devastated as the idea of not being able to see my best friends, boyfriend, or ocean every single day.  In a selfish way, I was mourning the loss of all that could have been, of experiences I could have made in the time I was losing.  Tomorrow I have to pack up all my things - momentos, textbooks, bedsheets -  out of the home I have found this year.  But examining my feelings, I realize that I am what is wrong with my world right now.  The main thing on my mind is the egotistical desire to be “happy”, to resist change in order to benefit myself.  In reality, COVID-19 is dangerous and there is no other choice but to leave.  I have to give up my wants and commit myself to the needs of the world around me.  
                                     <br><br>
In a similar way, many people of my time do not believe in the impacts of climate change and/or do not take it seriously enough.  Despite knowing how devastating going past a 2 degree celsius increase in global temperatures could be, in terms of ocean rising, environmental injustice, coral bleaching, loss of diversity, and more.  It is a real problem with real effects. 

                                     <br><br>

On one hand, it is amazing right now to see the global response to COVID-19.  It is a blessing to have higher ups that care about their people’s wellbeing, despite the chaos that has been taking over everyone across all spans of life.  It is reassuring to know that if something becomes an emergency, humans can react to avoid disaster.
                                     <br><br>


Of course, it is awful that we have not reached that sense of anxiety about our climate’s state.  We need to act now, but none of us have truly felt the effects in such a sudden time span like it has been with COVID-19.  Instead, this environmental disaster is exponential, an industrial anthropogenically made disaster that will hit unless we change radically.  Hopefully by your lifetime, people will be conscious of their decisions, live minimalistically, eat less red meat, ride their bikes as much as they can, and use self-sustaining gardening practices.  I look forward to teaching you guys about what this class has opened my eyes to, though hopefully you do not have to deal with it.  
                                     <br><br>


I love you all.  My aspirations for you are to remember to love one another as you would want to be loved.  That includes the earth.  I hope that I will teach you what it is to have awareness of the world around you, to be politically active, to never forget to unite together with your neighbor in a fight for our and our earth’s health.
                                     <br><br>
 
I love you!

change, sadly, as Trump won reelection in 2020. But it took 4 more years for the American people to see that we need change. Over that span, the climate crisis got exponentially worse, as many of the projections scientists made were becoming more true and true. By 2024, the American people knew that we had a problem to fix and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez qualified for presidency. She was elected as the first female president, and the youngest too. And in 2025, the green new deal was passed and swept the nation in reform. Much of the reform made was paid for by the absurdly wealthy Americans that make up the 1%, and in fact, most of them were fine with it. Conditions became so bad within those past 4 years that the 1% knew what they had to do to help save the planet. Regarding yourself, that same year you turned vegan for good and 5 years later, over 50% of the United States did too. You, as well as many Americans, saw the benefit to environmentally aware lifestyles and our historic consumer culture became much less significant. Much of our economy, in fact, was reliant on renewable energies and things that benefited rather than hurt the environment. You did your part for the climate crisis in these time by working as an economist for a renewable energy business that specialized in converting business to green workplaces. Your life had ultimately become so much better with the passing of the green new deal, and the same was true for nearly all Americans.

By 2030, America had cut greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%, and by 2040, by over 80%. With these astonishing landmarks, and America being a prime example of a large scale country putting so much effort into mending the climate crisis, and actually benefiting from it, much of the rest of the world followed. We moved together with most of Europe through the late 20's and through the 30's in transitioning to a green country but it wasn't until the 40's when we saw TREMENDOUS change with China drastically transitioning to renewable energies. Due to extreme development in technology which, in fact, decreased the cost of investing in renewable energy and increased efficiency of such sources, renewable energy became more beneficial for use than oil and other fossil fuels now both economically and environmentally. 
                                     <br><br>


By 2050, we had decreased greenhouse gas emissions by over 70% worldwide since 2020. And now, at the start of 2060, we near a 90% reduction in emission worldwide since 2020. This was merely a dream for your generation back then yet now, it is a reality. You did it. And its not as if any of your lives have become drab bleak lives as a cost. You are thriving. The green new deal sparked a whole economic revolution in itself that America, and eventually, the world, reaped the benefits of. You have an amazing job, in which, you helped the country transition to the green country it needed to be and you're pretty close to retiring now, actually. You have a family with children, and soon grandchildren, that won't have to worry about their planet dying. And you can say you did that. Congratulations Blake Gorham on the life you will one day fulfill.

In 2060, what is happening. I think in the face of what's happening in this world, with the virius, genocide, femicide, racism, transphobism, sexism, and everything -ism. I feel that this exercise is hard to do. There are so many things wrong with this world and to really think about what it will be like in 40 years? I can't. I think everything makes everything seem impossible and I just wanna have a reset button with conditions.  
                                     <br><br>
One of the chants from COLA is "We are unstoppable! Another world is possible!" It helped me a lot to think about how much we all want this and how much power the people have. 
                                     <br><br>

My imagination of the future is as follows:
                                     <br><br>
In an effort to properly respond to COVID-19 outbreak, Trump administration was removed and Sanders was installed into the government smoothly. On the second day, Bernie then passed a bill that says all workers should get time off paid and work from home as much as possible. As per Bernie’s direct tweet: “Short-term: we must provide emergency unemployment assistance and include workers who depend on tips, gig workers, domestic workers and independent contractors. Long-term: we need Medicare for All so your health insurance is not tied to your job.” Then after Coronavirus has been eliminated with least amount of casualty as possible. It would be time to move on to unpacking and dismantling all injustices occurrences in mass incarceration, biased education, excessive militarization all over USA and abroad, immigration laws, people in poverty, people in LGBTQAI+ communities, sweatshops, sexual assault, and much much more. 
                                     <br><br>

If we can re-evaluate how much money means and what it means to have money or not. To massively redefine success and happiness, really helps with the goal orientation. To stop sweatshops, to see all human beings and living creatures as beings, to value all work with what it is worth and see value in all things. To respect all living and non-living things.  To stop militarization, to stop american empire. To stop capitalism. To stop tmt. Stop pipeline projects. To stop colonization and imperialism. To stop exploitation.

Views from the apocalyptic now:
                                     <br><br>

It goes beyond collective or individual action being too little too late; it should never have been an issue in the first place. Somewhere in humanity’s timeline, we went horribly wrong and could never seem to bring ourselves back within reasonably boundaries of environmental and social ethics. We were born into a role that we all seemed far too eager to play, only to die never having realized that we were hardly aware of the game, nor its implications on the health of our home and on ourselves.
                                     <br><br>

In the year 2020, we were battling the corporations who were profiting from environmental degradation, the politicians who endorsed them, the skeptics they bred. We sought to change the corrupted American Dream, the lackadaisical mediocrity of the people, and the exploitive global market. We took on capitalism, the patriarchy, and humanity’s superiority complex. It was a tall order and we needed to rise to the challenge, but not enough of us rallied to action.
                                     <br><br>

The polarity of the climate crisis became so closely intertwined with social injustice that it was nearly impossible to facilitate cooperative collective action. Issues of age, race, and sex were increasingly pressed upon as we battled for change. Many of these social justice issues were also environmental justice issues; however, not enough of us were able to see the big picture: there are no human rights on a dead planet.
                                     <br><br>

The matter of politics ceased to matter as the administrative latency in our global governments could not keep up with the consequences of our inaction. As the world began to change, people lost faith in their governing bodies, their policies, their power. The information age ended, and the age of fear and confusion began.
                                     <br><br>

In developed countries, skepticism lingered as major corporations continued to resist change. They used every trick up their sleeves to stagnate a collective movement that would divert their precious money away from them and into the infrastructure, education, technology, and food systems humanity truly needed to survive cooperatively and sustainably with the planet. It felt like no one could see past the fleeting present moment. They didn’t care if the world burned, so long as they were having a good time. But, how could they? Our world was changing, and not for the better; scarce few were willing to admit responsibility and take drastic action.
                                     <br><br>

As the world began to noticeably change for those in the developed world, most didn’t alter their habits and lifestyles until they absolutely had to, if at all. They were unwilling to imagine for themselves a future where a green earth was possible. It seemed as though people would not take deliberate action to do their small part; unless altering their trajectory was made clear and convenient for them, many were simply lost. They didn’t know if they should act out of sheer desperation in a last attempt to change the fate of their lives and the lives of their progeny, or if they should give in to the enormity of the crisis and spiral nihilistically downwards. It was a time of fear and confusion.
                                     <br><br>

Money poured into various technological programs in an effort to discover the silver bullet solution to the climate decimation. For a while, people still held fast to the belief that their dollar made more of an impact than their actions. Programs that searched for a viable new planet were funded by those who felt they would find asylum in abandoning the wasted planet they contributed so greatly to creating; though, this only made the economic disparity wider, fueled unrest amongst the general people, and wasted funds that could be allocated to saving the planet that we currently occupy.
                                     <br><br>

Much of what was done was irreversible; we lost the North Pole and all the species of native creatures who once inhabited it. Countless marine organisms were lost forever as the oceans became too warm and too acidic. Island nations went underwater. Climate refugees poured into other countries, which resulted in interracial and intercultural conflicts. Foreign immigration was treated as a major problem, when all along, the true root of conflict was always environmentally related. Resources ran scarce as the demand increased but supply ran low due to failing biodiversity and extreme, unpredictable weather.

                                     <br><br>

We began to truly awaken when we started to die off. Thousands had died already, largely from developing nations who didn’t have the resources, governance, systems, relief programs, or infrastructure to survive the initial devastation of the climate crisis. More would die as humanity scrambled to lever the emergency break on the runaway train they’d created. With these losses, cultures and languages and dialects and religious sects were lost forever.
                                     <br><br>

We had no direction, no plan, no collaboration. However, in this apocalyptic age, some of us still have hope for a better future.
                                     <br><br>

There was and is so much to be done. We, humanity, have infinite potential to do better. In 2020, we needed to stop viewing the climate crisis as a issue with latent effects that wouldn’t harm us; we needed to understand that all life on our planet has value and was worth fighting for. It may be too late for us now in 2060 to repair the damage done, but 2020 was a defining age that should have been used as a pilot for the future. If only humanity chose to take drastic action then, this apocalyptic now would very likely cease to be a possibility.

2020 was lined up to be a year for the Democrats to take office. It was supposed to be the start of the Green New Deal. However, after the coronavirus encompassed the world, the markets crashed almost to all time lows. People were economically in a bad situation. Despite the dire climate crisis, people shoved it off, as always. Trump was reelected in 2020. People wanted someone that they knew the economy had prospered under before. All people wanted was to be economically stable again.. and he provided. However, Trump was mainly able to re-stimulate the economy largely at the detriment of the environment. Fossil fuels were subsidized heavily and once protected lands were opened up for logging and extracting.
                                     <br><br>

In 2024, people started to finally feel comfortable again. Democrats took the nomination and the climate crisis was finally addressed. The US was finally re-entered back into the Paris Climate Accord and harsher restrictions were put into place. Clean infrastructure was prioritized and put into place. Trains became efficient and significantly impacted the airline industry. Large solar plants and wind farms were starting to be put into place all across the US. We finally began to draw down our emissions and lead the world in the fight against the climate crisis.
                                     <br><br>

Other countries across the Earth also began to take action and began to implement clean energy. Our European counterparts led to way with their safe and efficient bike paths. The amount of cars driving on their roads significantly, as there wasn't much of a point anymore. People could get anywhere in the city efficiently on their bike and could take the train anywhere longer distance. 
                                     <br><br>

China's main goal was to get their industries, which still supplied most of the world, to be zero emissions. While everyone called it crazy, they tried their best and made significant progress. 
                                     <br><br>

Everything was going as planned. But we still waited too long to get this process started. Some of the largest fires hit the Congo Rainforests. The middle of the US was encapsulated in another dust bowl situation. Record highs and record lows hit Europe in a flurry of storms. Worst of all, the oceans still acidified, cutting off food for millions of people. Climate refugees were a common sight across the world.
                                     <br><br>

While yes, we should have started sooner, I'm glad we started at the time we did, because if we hadn't, then we wouldn't have even had to opportunity to recover from these disasters. People suffered, but at least we had the world's support behind our back. Never in history had the world been so willing and unified behind the goal of the saving the Earth. It was quite beautiful.

A message from the future:
                                     <br><br>

Hi! This is the letter from 2060. I am writing to you to tell you about the future since I know you are very curious about it. Actually, we did not solve the climate crisis, in other words, we slow down the speed of the climate crisis. I know this letter that I wrote to you maybe create a new timeline and it going to change the future. However, I really want you to know that the course you are taking-Engl 23-is helpful to save the earth, so you can listen to the solutions that professor Ken gives it to you and follow the instruction. 
                                     <br><br>

The earth that now you live in was gone. We are living in a whole new planet now, and we call this planet – Earth 2. There are a lot of planets like people create a multi-universe. Of course, we limited every planet’s population since people finally realize every problem that causes the climate crisis and the amount of population is one of the causes. People are dedicated to find a production solution that does not cause pollution. The clothes are expensive, so we only have around 30 stuffs to wear. The reason that clothes are expensive is they will cause chemical pollution and air pollution; also, they will exploit labor. The government set a tough restriction to garment factories. If they emit pollution that exceeds the standard that the government set, they will need to pay a huge penalty. The cost of producing clothes goes up, and the price goes up. The demand goes down since people will think about whether this stuff is necessary or not when they saw the price is high. We do not drive the car anymore on this new earth, at least now we take buses and trains. We choose to discuss online if the company we have to talk about is in another place or on another planet. The technology that we use is similar to FaceTime, hope this can help you to understand. We choose to meet each other online is also because we don’t take flights due to it emits a huge amount of CO2. I think most of us become vegetarian, and we also can eat lab-grown meat. Each person has a small room on the planet, the government suggested that people should live in a micro-apartment. Anyway, we try to protect this planet.
                                     <br><br>

These new planets were built for years, maybe the government know that the old earth will be destroyed by human eventually, so they built these secretly. In 2050, the virus, the starvation, the strange weather, and other disaster take more than a half population in the earth. The economy drops quickly. People finally realize that they should take action to save the earth and protect the future of their descendants. But it’s too late. The government uses spaceship to send people who are alive to the new planet they find, or they create. It’s hard to describe the situation in 2050, millions of people died in just a few months, it’s so terrible. 
                                     <br><br>

I wrote this letter to you is because I want to let you know that the solutions you know have the effect to save the earth. But it needs each person on the earth to make great efforts. If only one person makes an effort, it’s just like a drip in the ocean, will not have any impact on the planet. Please, try to be a vegetarian, take less flight, take more public transportation, consume less, live in a small house, and most importantly, I think is to tell and share the climate crisis and solutions to others. You should tell your parents and your friends who do not take any course that tell them the solution. 
                                     <br><br>

Hope this letter can change the future!
                                     <br><br>

Best,
                                     <br><br>

it’s 2060 and you don’t go by Danny anymore, but instead by Dan. I remember back in college when I took Ken Hiltner’s class at UCSB, Eng 23.You learned a lot in that class, and a lot following the class. That’s when I finally learned about the effects of carbon emissions and fossil fuels on our planet’s health and the impacts of day to day human activity….. or consumerism. It was a bleak time of growing harsh weather conditions where fires, tornadoes, and more unusual weather patterns ensued. The new generation--my generation, finally took the climate issue to new levels with the help of media and the digital age, expanding on the voices of Al Gore, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, and Jill Stein, and forming a new culture with a new focus. Along with it came metal straws, the ban of single use plastics, the rise of food alternatives and veganism, and many more climate-focused practices. This isn’t what you knew before college so you were grateful enough to leave Eng 23 with all this knowledge and motivation to contribute. You became a minimalist, and dreamed of saving enough money to finally live off the land and give back to the world. You changed for the better and found true happiness--a state that didn’t depend on the virtues of capitalism and consumerism but rather purpose in this planet. Along with your new outlook in life, the world changed as well. A rather bittersweet change.
                                     <br><br>


While enormous cities no longer existed and the new generations discovered ways to utilize the water from sea level rise and minimize comfort space, we were a little too late. A lot of climate activists, like Ken, had been warning us all of these issues but it took a course to finally convince you of this. A sad truth. There wasn’t nearly enough we could’ve done once the Green New Deal passed that would revert the effects of climate change, only slow it down. In the late 20s and 30s, the weather conditions worsened and people grew more aware of it. This was around the time when most climate skeptics changed their minds. Again, it was too late. Collective change increased those years and many more environmental politicians took charge, placing our planet first. Finally, by the 50s, Americans grew accustomed to living without carbon emissions thanks to the Green New Deal, but many did not make it. Heat and ocassional famine interrupted the mission to save the world. Many mass migrations occurred and you, devoted to change for those 30 years, took part in this migration with your adopted children whom educate you and allow to grow each day. 
                                     <br><br>



Now,.... well, I’m writing this letter, so you would assume I’m fine. I am. Warming as slowed and we just found out that the U.S has finally reached net zero carbon emmissions per year. I would tell you about all the ways we survive now from going to the restroom to finding clothes and food, but it would be too complicated. It only took 40 years but to put it simply, we became a more advanced and communal group of people whose priority was developing technology and establishing carbon tax that eventually reassessed our economy. Thanks to renewable energy, geoengineering techniques, and the commitment of the general public as pushed by the Green New Deal, we were able to save whatever there was left to save. It cost a lot of lives and time; however, for some, like me and you, it was a duty. A duty to save the world that generations before us left us with. To this day, I look back at Ken’s class at UCSB. That year was the major outbreak of covid-19 that finally allowed us to dismantle the economy and start anew. It was a mess, but we made it. Thank you, Ken. And thank you, Danny, for finally choosing a voice of your own.

This is your mom writing to you on Monday, March 9, 2020. I am currently a freshman in college at UC Santa Barbara. I hope this letter makes a significant impact on your life and you are reading this at an age to comprehend the weight of its contents.
                                      <br><br>

Waking up 200 feet from the ocean and watching dolphins while I do homework seems like a dream. I hear the waves crash as I sleep and watch the sunrise and sunset as often as I can. Everyone smiles. Everyone helps. Everyone shares the same easy-going vibe. Oh and everyone surfs. I can't wait to walk you around this college campus with your dad and have you stand where I stood and see what I saw every day for four years. I hope you are interested in going to college here but, of course, I will support you in any decision you make for your future!
                                     <br><br>
 
This university is where I first learned about the severity of climate change. English 23 was the official name of the class I took with Ken Hiltner, who nicknamed it "Climate Crisis." You know how conservative your grandparents are. Dude is a crazy right-wing activist and doesn't budge politically. He raised me almost the same. I was hesitant coming into this class since I was raised to believe that climate change was not a real problem because "the climate has always changed." I cannot tell you how many times I heard that argument growing up. I can truly say that I did not believe in it at all. This class allowed me to be more open to real effects right by me. Santa Barbara is the place being hit the hardest as far as rising temperatures. 
                                     <br><br>
 
It is also important to note that I am in the midst of moving out of my dorm room because of the mandatory evacuation of my university and the quarantines due to global pandemic, COVID-19 (coronavirus). The memes are absolutely insane. I wonder if your age group will also make and laugh at memes the way we do now. 
                                     <br><br>
Things are a bit crazy. After being in my cute little dorm room for 6 months, we are having to say goodbye to everything and everyone we know and love to go home until fall quarter. Spring quarter will be 100% online next quarter. I can’t wait to laugh about this when I meet you. 
                                     <br><br>
 
Anyways! I came into college not believing in climate change because of my conservative upbringing but I have allowed myself to branch out and accept real scientific data that cannot mean nothing. Costa Mesa, the city where I grew up is the best place ever for a million reasons but one of them being the amazing weather. Never too cold. Never too hot. Never anything hazardous. Well just last year, Christmas night of 2019 we had a tornado warning and had to go on lockdown. Our windows started leaking from heavy rains and we had our satellite cut in and out. What a Christmas, huh?
                                     <br><br>
 
I’m not sure what they will teach you in elementary school when you grow up, but I want you to know that I slowly am believing that even though this is a terrible thing, and human-caused, that it is very likely to be a true phenomenon. I hope that you can have an open mind when reading this and I hope that I raise this family to be eco-conscious in every aspect of our lives as possible.
                                     <br><br>
 
I love you so much! Cannot wait to meet you!

<p>

What did we do? What did I do? 
                                     <br><br>


If I had to answer this question a mere three weeks ago, the answer would be clear. Bernie Sanders would win the nomination in 2020. We’d win the Senate, or at least get close, and with the power of movements and a backlash to the hell of coronavirus and recession we’d be able to get incredible things done. Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, etc.; we would rebuild our infrastructure, create 20 million new jobs, genuinely fix the climate crisis both here and abroad. We would win. 

                                     <br><br>

But it is not three weeks ago. Bernie is almost certainly not going to win the nomination, and Biden nor Trump are going to take aggressive climate action. So, to ask myself again... what did we do? What did I do? 

                                     <br><br>

First, I don’t think we’ll be doing much electorally anymore, at least for this decade. The progressive electoral takeover of the Democratic Party has probably failed for the 2020s. This doesn’t mean that we’ve stopped doing things, though. In the fallout of Coronavirus and the inevitable recession of 2020, the end of quarantines and pandemic will see a huge wave of backlash and activism. I cannot imagine that the Democratic Socialists of America, Sunrise Movement, and the hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of activists who have been radicalized and organizing for the past four years do not genuinely make non-electoral moves for power very, very soon, whether Trump or Biden wins. The immediate demands probably will not be environmental, though. They’ll likely be medical and economic: coronavirus and a recession simply makes that too necessary to ignore. But any movement that agitates and brings pressure on government for any kind of left-wing demands will end up doing the same for environmental ones, too. With the climate strikes starting as essentially just an idea and a march last year, I would not be surprised if they only accelerated as things start breaking down more and more. By the end of 2030, I don’t see a leftist, or a real environmentalist, being in office. But I do see a constantly-growing group of young, disenfranchised, and angry people pressuring them and fighting for what’s right every step of the way. 

                                     <br><br>

By 2030, I think it will probably be... well... too late. Too late to hit 1.5C, that is. At that point, it will be an exercise in reeling in the worst and stopping further catastrophe rather than truly revitalizing our atmosphere. But this is achievable. Improve our infrastructure, make sure that we’re more hurricane-resistant; have better systems to deal with wildfires; become more prepared for climate-caused outbreaks; have better response teams for disasters. Figure out how to supplement our food systems and have more renewable energy to deal with a lack of oil. This... this, at this point, is what I think is most likely. Not really an end to climate change, but a slowdown. A next step, at least. 

                                     <br><br>

But goodness. 2060? That’s a long ways ahead. I can barely even imagine, but I really do think we’re on that path. Not one of.. victory, but not one of full defeat, either. Something kind of in-between. Better planning and preparation for climate emergencies, but only affecting the symptoms and not the cause. A reduction of carbon emissions, hell maybe even full carbon neutrality by 50 or 60, but still far too little, far too late. I... don’t like the future that I’m seeing here, all too much. Just a slow and steady decay, bit by bit. But I’m just not sure how else it would go. 

                                     <br><br>

Wow, this wasn’t very heartening. 
                                     <br><br>


But I guess it’s not a worst-case scenario, either.

I guess it’ll have to do. But I’ll do my best to make it better than what’s here.

I want to be able to look back and say we tried. If we couldn’t fix it then we couldn’t fix it, that’s that. But I at least want to say that an honest effort was put in and frankly I just don’t feel like we are doing it. I’d love to say that Bernie won the 2020 election and democrats took the house and that those democrats weren’t afraid to make the changes that they needed to make to get the job done. I’d love to say that society was smart/brave enough to make the tough choices. But I don’t think we’re there yet. If we’ll get there in time or even at all is something I wish I knew. I wish the problem was easier to communicate and I wish that there weren’t people blatantly lying and trying to discourage the truth and profiting off of it. I wish I could eat meat once in a while and not feel so bad about it or not feel bad about driving home to see my family. But that is just the world we live in. I resolved to do what I can to help. I don’t eat meat anymore and I gave up driving. They are not particularly fun things to do but they are also not hard and they are absolutely necessary. I wish people would buckle down and figure out that a little bit of effort actually goes a long way. I wish we lived in a country that valued the lives of the people over the profitability of a fortune 500 company. The coronavirus outbreak has shined a spotlight on many things wrong with this country but most importantly it showed that we have the money to pay for what we need to do, and that we just don’t care enough. People only care about the problem when its fast, when its being pumped out of the barrel of a gun. But the climate crisis is a snowball that’s rolling very slow but gaining a lot of mass and speed and won’t be possible to stop soon. By the time people wake up to the disaster that’s coming the snowball will be too much to stop. I wish for a lot of things but wishing doesn’t help. Doing what we know needs to be done when it needs to be done will help. That’s it.

Dear future self,                                     <br><br>

Do not let fear stop you from helping the cause, do not let social norms stop you from doing what is right. A lot of people say the changes we need to make are "too big, not fast, not practical" but what does that entail? What is considered not practical in saving the planet we inhabit? There are so many things we can reverse if we just put in the effort to be the change we need to see then we wouldn't have much if a problem. I know for you it sounds easy, but for most people not eating meat and driving cars sounds just completely out of pocket. So for you, keep spreading the word about the climate crisis that needs to be heard worldwide... people need to hear it so they can understand that they too can make a huge difference even with the little things they can do.

To all in 2020,                                     <br><br>

I am writing to you in 2060.                                     <br><br>

It may sound miraculous, or impossible that we fix the climate crisis. Indeed, the whole world has been changed. There is no such saying of the climate crisis for us in 2060 because ever since 2040, the whole world had collapsed, and a small portion of humanity had gone on Mars. Yes, you are right, and I am on Mars now where we call it home, mother Mars, or whatever. I always remembered the first day I went on to English 23 class and Ken told us that there is only a couple of decades for us to save the world. I was pessimistic when I heard Ken said this to us and I couldn’t keep thinking about how we could save it within such a little time period. All the suggestions and research that Ken delivered are tangible and real. Over 96 percent of the climate scientists are right about one thing: the anthropogenic climate change and its disastrous consequences. However, none of us ever act upon it. All I have learned are just knowledge but not power. I was thinking about the topic that Ken has discussed in his lectures like food waste, voting, minimalist, consumerism, and oil companies. And all of these don’t really matter when I am on the jet heading to Mars. Looking down on planet Earth, I have an unusual feeling not only because I have never seen it from such a view but also, I feel like we are going to somewhere unimaginable and unsecure. The only place I feel safe about is Earth. It was 2040 and it was the last day of history when humanity was still on Earth. 
                                     <br><br>

Once I recalled the days on Earth, I hope Mars is still the dream whereas saving Earth from the climate crisis is not.

Your name means “sea” in Hawaiian and “forgiveness” in Japanese. I gave you this name because I grew up on a small island surrounded by the ocean. My country used to be colonized by the Japanese, so nicknames were usually given in that language. Like my grandma, her nickname meant “lily” and it was so beautiful. Your birth is a representation of hope to us. Not just to our family but to your future generations as well. I pray that you could forgive what my generation and previous generations had done to cause any inconvenience in your lifetime. The solutions that were suggested during my lifetime are not enough to fix the issue that you now face.
                                     <br><br>

To be honest, I am a product of our environment. I was lucky enough to uncover the truth of the fossil fuel industry when I was in college. However, the damage has been done. I’ve participated in unfriendly environmental actions prior to my exposure to the intentions of these big corporations. I hope you learn from my mistakes and be an outspoken individual in climate activism. Although your generation might not be able to completely reverse it, but if you are able to keep it stagnant that will be better than doing nothing at all. 
                                     <br><br>

I hope you will be able to educate your kids and my grandkids at a young age about the climate crisis. Giving the knowledge is just like giving them the power to begin their journey of finding out the truth about Earth. Perhaps they can spread the information to their peers and friends. The more people that are educated on this topic, the more our community will benefit from it. It doesn’t matter which party is in control of the government. I just want someone that cares to take office. I want someone that cares not only for themselves but also the people they serve, the world we all live in. 
                                     <br><br>

I fancy a world with just bikes roaming around cities, neighborhoods, and every terrain that you could possibly imagined. I picture the greenest hills and the bluest seas to thrive under the care of every resident around the world. I want a better living space for all of us especially those that live at threatened zones. I understand there will be more pressing issues such as humanitarian crisis and global economy falls but know that the root of these problems usually traces back to how we’ve mistreated out planet since the Industrial Revolution. We can no longer let companies like Exxon Mobile continue to exploit our land and our rights. We have to stand up as a united front to fight against these big conglomerates or no else will. 
                                     <br><br>

Lastly, I want you to know no matter how small each personal action could be. Do it. Knowing your contribution will matter in some shape or form will encourage to do more in the future. Start small and maintain it. There’s no use if it’s just a one-time deal. Much like other things in life. Ditch the single plastic. Stick with reusable items. Vote not just once but many more times. Don’t just cut down one flight. Cut down multiple. Maybe invest that money somewhere else. It could end up a big surprise for you! Ride that bike more than once. You will see the benefits it reaps. Do the little things and they will add up. Trust me, if everyone around the world does one small thing that’s one big thing for that one moment. If these moments accumulate, maybe we will be able to shift the climate to a positive direction and achieve what we have hoped for.

It feels weird to write a letter to your future children because it seems like it’s really far away but I realized I’m almost 20. That’s so scary how fast time is passing but I loved how you already have a name for your future child and explained all the things your generation didn’t do for the preparation of climate change. I also wanted to write a letter to my child/ children in 2060 and have some names prepared but I don’t know for sure yet! For now, I’ll name my child “Hope” for the future.
                                     <br><br>


Dear Hope,                                     <br><br>

I don’t know why your name is Hope but I always liked the names on the TV show “The Originals” and I feel like the name Hope can represent a lot of things especially when people lack the means to do anything. My professor from English 23 wanted me to write you a letter describing the mistakes my and his generation did wrong for climate change to become the way it is now. I truly hope the future is better and you guys actually figured out a way to control carbon emission better than us. The reason why I wanted to name you Hope is because I want you to be a part of something that means much more than self- interest and give hope to people who think they can’t make a difference by themselves. We currently have a lot of ignorant people who choose to believe that climate change isn’t real even if there are scientists that prove that climate change is already happening. These people are people with influence and power as well. Imagine how the public is being influenced and used by them because they simply can’t stop their carbon emission from increasing just to please themselves. I hope that in the future, there are public figures that act upon what’s right and not what will make more money. There are many actions that could be utilized in order to reduce carbon emission across the world although, the United States is the #1 country that is releasing carbon emission and I hope in the future, we aren’t #1 anymore or at least our total carbon emission as a country will be lower. MUCH LOWER. 

                                     <br><br>

I really like the idea of living in smaller and compact housing in order to reduce carbon emission that is released to the atmosphere and a world where there is just less waste in general. The number one reason why carbon emission is so high is due to food waste and there are many ways to reduce this number. That is to simply stop wasting food and not buy/ use more than what you actually need. In our generation, we think as more is better which is simply not the case. I wish you can learn to be satisfied with fewer items and understand how much of an impact that item is to the world. If I spoiled you when you were younger, that is on me and I will try my best not to actually do that in the future, but I know so many people who have things that are unused and just sitting there. They don’t realize because they bought that item, leading the fashion or whatever industry they bought it from to think “this is what the major wants so we will continue to make this” and never realizing how harmful it is to make this item. In shorter words, I just want you to be conscious of what you buy and think about if you really need it or just want it because others have it. 

                                     <br><br>

Hopefully, I will also start to reduce my carbon emission by reducing my consumption of red meats because they emit a lot of carbon emission just by living. Through this class, I became more conscious of my actions that release carbon emission to the atmosphere. I recently watched a film (through this class) that showed a father changing his whole lifestyle just to provide a future for his children and I wanted to do that too. I understand how hard it is to change something right away especially something you have done your whole life but in order to secure a future for you, I will do my best to reduce my own carbon emission. If you believe that one person’s effort is not enough, it really isn’t but if you educate your peers and friends, collectively, it will make a difference. I hope in the future, there will be a future for you and not a difficult one because currently, it looks like it will be. Just know that I love you and wish nothing but the best for you.


Love,                                     <br><br>

40 years ago, the climate crisis didn’t seem as critical as it was in reality. 
                                     <br><br>


As a college freshman, I signed up for a class called “The Climate Crisis” because I needed the GE credits. I attended lectures, did the homework, and studied as any good student should. I began to realize the significance of the issue and the impact it would have on my generation and the future. However, like many others with the privilege of attending a four-year university at a beautiful campus, I was complacent in my situation. I rationalized every decision I made: I was already a vegetarian, I thrifted a lot of my clothes, I biked or took the bus to class – I was doing my part. The climate crisis didn’t affect me directly; even the November 2019 fires destroying thousands of acres of land in full view from my dorm wasn’t enough to spur me into conscious action.
                                     <br><br>


Then the Florida coast flooded. And small islands in the South Pacific. The devastation caused by sea-level rise was widespread and rampant. News coverage depicted families evacuating to more inland communities in Florida. But in small countries such as Kiribati, citizens had nowhere to go, and their civilization was destroyed. I was witnessing this all happen from my comfortably-sized apartment living room – and I was doing nothing about it. The guilt of inaction and the responsibility to the human race became palpable, and it was then when I realized I needed to do something.
                                     <br><br>


I began to transition to a climatarian diet, growing my own food or buying locally. I limited my dairy products even more than I did before. I began to shop only second-hand or purchase from fair trade certified brands. I commuted to work via bike or public transportation, only using a car when absolutely necessary. I gave up flying, which was the most difficult measure I had to take, considering I had family spread out over the United States. Family get-togethers became more difficult, but we made it work with thorough planning and compromise. 
                                     <br><br>


Over time, I became content in my intentional decisions to impact the planet in a positive way. But it wasn’t enough. I felt small, and I wanted to be a part of something bigger than myself. I began encouraging my family members and friends to commit to living a climate-friendly lifestyle with me. While I expected them to push back, they happily obliged. Living this counterculture lifestyle became easier when I was surrounded by an entire community supporting each other in our efforts. 
                                     <br><br>


Meanwhile, the White House was in a panic. The aftermath of the Florida flooding cost the government millions of dollars and millions of lives. The campaigns that the Democrats had been advocating, encompassed by the Green New Deal, became a reality despite negative responses from a handful of people. It was horrible that it took a disaster to force the government to do something about the climate crisis, but good was created out of a dark situation. 

                                     <br><br>

It was a strange time following the implementation of the Green New Deal. As with any legislative measure, it took time to readjust to the new norms of society. With the depletion of jobs in the big oil and gas sector, new career opportunities opened up in green energy. Restoration efforts sprouted all across the country and globe. In the beginning stages of the Green New Deal, there was a lot of division between those who wanted to keep the traditions of the past and those who envisioned a brighter future. Picketers, lobbyists, and government officials alike did all they could to combat this unprecedented change. They didn’t believe we could continue the human race and take care of our planet. We proved them wrong.

                                     <br><br>

While all of these government actions were necessary to promote the prosperity of the planet, I didn’t see myself taking part in them. I knew I had to do something, but I didn’t know what. I thought back to the climate crisis class I took in 2020 and remembered Project Drawdown’s solutions. One of them was educating girls and boys equally and providing safe, reproductive options to women. I did some research, and soon after that, I became involved with an organization that provided education and reproductive health resources to women without readily available access. I stayed with this nonprofit for 20 years, and throughout that time, we were able to bridge the gap between male and female education and give more women bodily autonomy. 
                                     <br><br>


With all this to say, though we made steps to combat the climate crisis, there is always more to do. We should not become complacent in our efforts to make this planet a more beautiful, safe, and healthy place. We must prioritize Earth and all of its living creatures in every action we take. Let the past 100 years be a lesson for the future. Humanity caused a problem, but we were able to solve it. We could have found solutions more quickly, we could have cared more about our planet before it was too late, we could have even avoided this situation in the first place. But I hope that we can look back and the climate crisis as a journey of triumph.

Dear 2060 self:
                                     <br><br>

Well if you’re reading this in this year, first off congratulations on surviving the CoronaVirus! (from the start of 2020). To come to reality,  we have lost millions of miles of coastline world wide due to the increase in sea level. But, we made it out alive somehow still. Sure, there have been stricter laws that have been set in place, but those were just different laws in a different place in history. The important part to take away from this is how the world came together.
                                     <br><br>

It was a crucial point in our time for the world and with everything going on, the one thing we need to do was set aside our differences as countries and come together as a human race. Halting our differences and opinions led to us coming together as one community in order to survive. The leap of faith we took as humans to invest our time, money and resources into renewable energies paid off. At first there were many uncertainties, but in future, now, look at how well it paid off. We must not forget what has happened and acknowledge both the positive and negative results in the process. 
                                     <br><br>

The negative outcomes were many, but here are some of the big ones: Many species have gone extinct. The amount of land that is out available to american citizens is now a quarter of an acre. 
                                     <br><br>
The coral reef is pretty much gone. Yes, many desert species died when putting solar panels over thousands of square miles. Yes, the average person does not have much land to claim for themselves. Yes, the coral reef is gone. But in the end humanity survived somehow, someway, persevered enough to make it through. I think spreading awareness of simply what was going on was the best way to help change the climate crisis. 

                                     <br><br>
We must remember what we have and not forget where we came from, but also cherish every moment being able to still live on this planet.The only way to keep it this way is to strive for less damages to the Earth and keep innovating in ways to help the global community. 

                                     <br><br>
If you weren’t able to read this in the year 2060, that sucks…

A future with a good ending in climate change is certainly what everybody hopes for, but the process itself that may lead us to a future with less people dislocated due to sea-level rise, less species extinction due to habitat fragmentation, and less pollution would be a truly triumphant moment in the history of mankind - as it would require us to look past self-interest and act on altruism. If this future does come true, I am sure the many generations that come after us will be thankful and hold pride in all of us.
                                     <br><br>


Yes, it is important to recognize what we have done and all the negative things that are going on, but it is also important to believe in ourselves and live in the present, to have faith and not lose hope that we could always do better.




</span></div><hr>




<p>

I can envision our future both going in a bad direction or a good direction but that’s just how my thought process goes, I’m very pessimistic but in the most optimistic way. To further explain myself, I tend to think the worst possible outcome of things so when and if it does result in that I am not caught off guard and have mentally prepared myself, but if the opposite occurs then I’m over the moon thrilled, either way it’s sort of a win-win situation. 
                                     <br><br>

Bad outcome:                                     <br><br>

The year is 2061, the generation of boomer’s that were in power in 2020 denied climate change and managed to convince the public it was just a hoax, which caused tremendous issues for us and the younger generations who have to live through the effects now. Big companies kept destroying forest land and it got to the point that they ran out of room, what used to be the amazon is now a center of distribution for {insert company name here}. People have to wear special masks to go out because of all the chemicals in the air that are not being absorbed by the non-existing forests, the oceans no longer contain beautiful sea creatures and kids now a days have no idea what coral reefs are since they went extinct years prior to their births. I sit in my small home telling my grandchildren stories of the time when I was their age and was able to play outside without a care in the world, no masks, just me and the fresh air. They ask me why my generation did nothing to help prevent this and I never know how to answer their question because I too asked the same question back in 2020, why didn’t the baby boomer generation do anything to help prevent things from getting out of hand? All I can say is that we tried but people wouldn’t listen. It was sad to see the earth slowly dying, places flooding underwater, crops not being able to be grown in many places like they used to, people being homeless and dying of starvation. Although I’m on my way out, some children are barely being born and imagining that they wouldn’t have a full life to live wasn’t fair. This planet will become inhabitable in a matter of no time and nobody can do anything now, not like it would help anyhow. 
                                     <br><br>

Good Outcome:                                     <br><br>

The Gen Z’s did it! we fought for people to realize the damage they have been causing our planet for years and opened their eyes to new ways of living that helped get our planet to the healthy state that it is now. We now only plant what is necessary to supply people and we use all of it no matter how the product looks because it all tastes the same. People started biking more and driving only when absolutely necessary and even then, some would just take public transportation which is now more convenient than ever, the busses got remodeled to be more comfortable but still fit a ton of people and it works by mobile app. Once you choose a time that you’d like to leave it makes a group with others who are leaving at the same time and it sets up a meeting location that’s convenient for all parties and you’re off on the dot. It caught on pretty early on and people saw that that was the thing to do and so everybody started joining in, same with the trend with tiny houses. People found them trendy and cute so now we all live in them or in micro apartments, communities started forming and that caused people to come closer together and be there to support each other. Once people started transitioning into this lifestyle many of the fossil fuel supporting companies lost a lot of money and stopped production of their products which meant a major help to the environment. Many became aware of what a Climatarian was and so they changed their diets, meaning beef was not so much in demand anymore which called for less cattle to produce methane. 
                                     <br><br>

All of these little things led up to having a healthy planet for generations to come, it’s a good thing we all came together in the end before it really became too late for us to do anything at all. Now we will all go down in history as the generation who saved the planet from becoming uninhabitable.

First and foremost. Relax. Take a deep breath. Whatever it is, I can promise you it will be obsolete before you know it. I can assure that. Do you know why? Because I am you, but writing to you from the year 2060. You made it. You survived COVID-19 and all of the other madness that the world threw your way. I know that times are tough but if you knew what you will become and what you will accomplish you would carry so much less weight around with you and hold your head higher. Believe it or not you do graduate from UCSB in four years, as an alcoholic or not is besides the point, but you pursue your dreams with a biology degree; organic chemistry almost kills you but your friends help you through it. What you become I won't tell you yet because I would hate to influence your decision and I am sure you wouldn’t even believe it if I told you. Just know you did it, all on your own. 
                                     <br><br>

As far as saving the world goes, you killed that shit. You stay vegetarian for a while but then you commit to becoming vegan and become an activist for animals and plant-based diets. You also ditch the fast fashion and buy strictly second hand clothing and even learn to sew your own stuff! You live small and quaint on a beach in Southern California, working your dream job close to home and commuting on your bike. 
                                     <br><br>

As far as our generation goes, we found a state of unity where everyone agreed to put communal health and happiness before our personal wealth. It took a lot of convincing but after the green new deal was implemented, because we got enough young people to get out and vote, people’s minds changed and making individualistic lifestyle changes in order to save the planet came with such  ease. It helped climate deniers and billionaires realize that helping people is so much more important and rewarding than individual success and profiting off of the destruction of others. In contrast to the popular opinion this new deal actually created jobs, promoted the circulation of money, and increased public joy and service. 
                                     <br><br>

Overall, you should be proud of yourself and your generation. You guys did it! You saved the planet! I’ll leave you with this:
                                     <br><br>
 “We have the courage to be whatever we have the courage to see.”
                                     <br><br>
So, close your eyes and imagine the world you want and it will be.
                                     <br><br>

Hi, people from the future, hi you little cute kids:                                     <br><br>

When I enter my college at 2019, I didn't expect I will take a class to reflect about human beings instead of learning something from human beings. Well, but I got to say it is totally worth it. Until this class, I never realize the fully meaning of being a vegan, and how beef harms the environment, such things like this. And I know more about how we can save the environment by being the change.
                                     <br><br>

I don’t really know how’s the world now at your time, is out efforts successful or we still fail our destiny? No matter what I hope you guys can continue our work and make it last, make the human society lasts, make everyone cherish our time being on this planet and the environment the planet gifts us. Ken told us we can protect the environment effectively from building wind turbines, reducing food waste, eating plant-rich diet, protecting the tropical forests, educating girls and doing family planning, applying solar farms, doing silvopasture, using rooftop solar, regenerating agriculture, protecting temperate forests, protecting peat lands, planting tropical staple trees, afforestation, conservation agriculture, a system of tree intercropping, doing geothermal, planning managed grazing, nuclear energies, using clean cookstoves, using offshore wind turbines, restoring farmlands, improving rice cultivation, using concentrated solar, I’m so curious right now, how many programs have you guys practiced already and whether they are effective enough as we measure today.
                                     <br><br>

I hope through our work, the political atmosphere on protecting the environment is finally changing that the government are actually setting rules against wasting and pollutions instead of only advertising. You have no idea how people were using the resources at our time freely. Is the air pollution better now in China? Can people finally see blue skies nowadays? I’m just so curious about this.

Dear 8th graders,                                     <br><br>

Today we will be learning about the policies that our government took in order to make the planet a more safe and sustainable place for you all to live.
                                     <br><br>
Most of the progress started in 2020 when Bernie Sanders took office and initiated the green new deal; a new age of revolution began in the United States.
                                     <br><br>
The introduction of the green new deal made grand sweeping changes such as converting to renewable energy, building new public transportation infrastructure, increased carbon costs, etc.
                                     <br><br>
Because of the increased focus on saving the planet, society became less obsessed with social media, and instead used less time on their phones, and more time spreading action collectively within communities via political activism, environmental art, and volunteering. 
                                     <br><br>
Starting in California cities, and later spreading to the rest of the United States, the price of beef products increased when carbon taxes also increased. At first people were furious, as it seemed as if their freedom to buy affordable meat was limited. As a result, the public consumed far less meat due to its inflated price. Out of surprise, many adults noticed that their reduction of meat consumption allowed them to shed off a couple pounds, while lowering their cholesterol. Today, meat is not seen as essential to one’s diet; however, in 2020 most Americans consumed it on a daily basis. By 2050, veganism became the norm as 80% of American switched to plant-based diets, and raised their children vegan as well. 
                                     <br><br>
Although veganism was a much better diet alternative in terms of minimizing climate change, something had to be done about the food waste system. When Chloe McKerr took office, she made household compost waste management free and accessible to all. Through her, we have the structure where every week a truck comes to pick up compost and is later brought to each county’s local gardens so that it could be utilized to enhance crop quality. Additionally, under her legislation restaurants and grocery stores were taxed if their food waste was beyond a certain weight, a system that changed waste management industry. Therefore, farmers stopped overgrowing food that used many natural resources to produce. People then were wasting less food and restaurants actually saved money as they bought only what they needed.
                                     <br><br>
 In terms of transportation, once China completed their Belt and Road Initiative, every person in the world was able to transport from country to country by car, drastically decreasing the amount of carbon emitted by airplanes. Additionally, before your time, streets had been designed primarily for cars, leaving little space for bikers. In the 2030s, the U.S. government demanded to reorder popular highways and streets in major cities. As a result, lines were redrawn with biking lanes that provide us with plentiful space and diminish risk of injury to bikers. Because of this there is less space on the road for cars, making highways crowded with traffic. Tired of traffic and expensive gas prices, most able-bodied US citizens now bike as their primary mode of transportation, leaving far less cars on the road, and more electrical bikes. Those who need to make longer commutes for work utilize public transportation more than ever before.
                                     <br><br>
 Although all of these implementations have been extremely successful, our population is still growing. For every person on this Earth, there are more and more natural resources depleted and carbon emissions in the air. Therefore, we cannot stop here. We must continue to care for our planet and push for new policies. The future is in your hands. The future of your generation will impact all those who come after you, just like how my generation fought for yours. We as a species must care for one another and our home. Fight for your right to a clean planet.

Dear future self,                                      <br><br>

The biggest virus that we encounter today is not COVID-19, but the status quo. 
                                     <br><br>


All the questions of cultural change that we encounter regarding the climate crisis can be summed up like this: are we willing to see the status quo as a choice? That is to say, will the general population realize that the status quo is merely another framework, a framework that can be adopted, tested, and then replaced if need be? The status quo, we've learned, is the biggest danger to the climate facing us right now. The status quo says change, but slowly. It says vote, but moderately. It says save the planet, but only for us. It is the disease that infects those that fail to act one way or another. Most of us experience it chronically, and can slip into it on a day-to-day, choice-to-choice basis. The end of this planet will be decided not by an affirmative yes or no, but instead a shrug of the shoulders. At this point, the chances of preventing massive environmental catastrophe are grim, but importantly, we each have choices to make everyday that can stop it. 

                                     <br><br>

That's all pretty abstract, so let's zoom in on the situation in the US. Now that the moderate vote has unified, Bernie's chance at the democratic nomination is essentially zero. This leaves us with a similar, but not entirely the same, situation to 2016. A very long time politician (to an extreme in Biden's case) vs an incumbent 'outsider'. A man who speaks like he's senile vs someone capable of spinning impeachment into record approval ratings. A man who has basically no motivated base (many of his votes being decided last minute) vs the first president to never stop holding rallies and exciting his base throughout his time in office. Trump has impressive turnout for his incumbent primaries, an order of magnitude greater than turnout for previous incumbents. He has a strong framework. Yes, it's one that's extremely harmful to any but the elite class, but that doesn't matter. Getting people to vote matters more than what the general population may think. Biden doesn't have a framework. He's a man of the status quo, which, if freely and actively chosen, is not a bad thing necessarily. In the face of the climate crisis, however, the status quo is extremely dangerous. As I've said, it doesn't move to action, it crawls. It's what makes a person buy a McMansion filled with consumer goods, eat vegan foods flown in from South America, and buy a Tesla. Even if Biden wins, the climate would still suffer. Fracking won't be banned, car culture will live on, flying will remain frequent, and our culture ultimately won't change. 

                                     <br><br>

The question, then, is how do we cure this disease of the status quo? What vaccine protects against this kind of virus? I believe that by your time, 40 years in the future, we will need to have a fundamental change in the way we think, in our reactions to the world around us. Right now, we are just barely having a 'return to sincerity' after post-modernism. This is a promising first step, but we need more. In the next 40 years, if not sooner, we need a sort of 'second enlightenment'. I mean this not in the exact ideas being introduced, but instead of the immense influence such a movement would have. Perhaps a look back at existential philosophy would help. Society needs to realize their ability to define their possibilities entirely for themselves, i.e. a realization of the power of collective action within our individual actions. Voting is the perfect example. People need to think what would happen if everyone thought the way they did. If tens of millions of young voters don't turn out this election, all under the guise of them thinking their vote doesn't count, then they have merely upheld the status quo and achieved nothing. If enough (300) people individually decide not to fly, that's enough to have one less plane off the ground. If even more people realize this, more planes won't fly. It's certainly not easy to think that our choices should always be actively, freely chosen (after all, this leads to Angst), but this kind of cultural change is the prevention and cure for the disease of the status quo. What this cultural change might look like, I'm not sure. Again, a status quo existing, a center point where most views/frameworks align is not the issue. It's when people fail to think for themselves and let this automatically become their worldview. 

                                     <br><br>

So, future self, I keep my expectations low but my hopes high for the immediate future. I hope that in the future you live in, people live sincerely, considering how their actions affect their immediate community but also the world community. We need to live our lives not as an infinite chain of "in order to..."s, but instead "for the sake of"s. That's where the last part of my current climate change course comes into play: the film 'Happy' made me realize the importance of sincerity and community in our lives. I think you should give it another watch, future self. If your world looks more like that than it does now, then maybe hope is left for the planet, including all the species on it. The mindfulness required for a meaningful, happy life would necessitate climate action, on the personal, political, and activist levels. When people don't separate themselves from their actions, they will begin to pay real attention to the signs all around us that the climate crisis is real, and it's worsening if we don't act now. 
                                     <br><br>


Good luck future self (though I might need it more than you!), and write me back if that's a thing in the future. In the meantime, I am actively trying to change my diet towards in-season and plant-based, getting only what I need. I've actually voted every time I had the opportunity to. The last step for myself would be to become involved in some sort of activism or perhaps creating art that expresses my views on the status quo. I can't sit and wait for a response that'll probably never come. The process starts now, and it starts with my own choices.

<p>
It's your Dad. I'm currently writing this message to you from UCSB’s library. I’m sitting on the fourth floor with Chloe, Neil, Trent and rick. What’s happening in my life right now? Corona virus is causing chaos everywhere. My classes were cancelled and now our finals are online. Other than that life is good. I'm writing this message to you to tell you what I'm thinking towards the status of the climate crisis and what I will do about it.
                                     <br><br>

There is no question in my mind that the climate crisis is real and that humans are taking advantage of precious natural resources with little regard for the consequences these actions will have on future generations. An artificial island the size of Texas is forming in the pacific ocean due to the mismanagement of waste resources. The great barrier reef bleaching due to ocean acidification. The amazon rain forest is on fire to clear the way for farms. The list goes on. 
                                     <br><br>

Now that you understand that I understand the gravity of the climate crisis, I want to tell you my personal plan to do something about it. 
                                     <br><br>

I will vote for political leaders who believe the climate crisis exists and plan to do something about it.  I plan to work for a company that is  practicing sustainable policies or is working to solve one specific aspect of climate change. As of now, I am not sure of what I will be doing in terms of my career in 40 years but whatever it is I promise that it will not be detrimental to the environment. I will try to use public transportation as much as possible and never become a blind consumer. What I buy will have a need. In regard to my diet, I am not sure I can commit to never eating meat. However, I promise that the meat I consume will be the most sustainable meat on the market. Whether its synthetically grown meat in a lab or locally butchered, I will do my best.
                                     <br><br>

Although I know my list of sacrifices is rather incomplete, I promise to do my best to live my life and teach you to live yours in a way that respects our home: the earth.
                                     <br><br>

Love,
                                     <br><br>
Dad

A message to the future                                     <br><br>

Hey! It's William! In case you have not all died from coronavirus or civil war or the accelerated effects of climate change, you should listen to this. Climate change is the biggest problem in the world right now. It will probably still be the case when you are reading this. If not, then I hope that your world looks more beautiful and more happy than mine does right now. I hope that things have changed for the better and that the changes that were needed in order to combat the climate crisis were changes that made the world a significantly better place to live in.  
                                     <br><br>
 I hope that I will buy less clothes, be a vegan, ride a bike, be healthier, not eat products with palm oil, thrift more, turn of the faucet when I brush my teeth, turn off the lights whenever I leave the house, not have more than one child, live in a small house in an urban area, pay carbon tax, and do all not because I have to but because I realize the impact that my lifestyle at this time has had on the rest of world. I hope that I am not just a person but a citizen of the world: looking out at all the possibilities that climate change has to offer: not just for my little bubble of a life but for everyone. 
 
                                     <br><br>
A message from the Future
                                     <br><br>
 William!! You did it. After completing your first year of college you became a vegan, rode a bike more, moved to a large city with a small house and excellent public transportation infrastructure. You still were able to travel, but you did so over long periods of time, sailing across the world on a zero emission yacht. You were still able to buy clothes, but everything you buy now is thrifted and repaired. You are now officially a minimalist: you buy less, live with less, but you still somehow do more and are happier that you do it. You live a life that is more vivid and more connected to those around you then you could ever have imagined. You are happy still: don't worry, with your help the world can get through this.



</p><hr>



<p>
I hope everything is well, I hope you are in good health and that your kids have grown up to be successful and happy in whatever they are doing. I sit here trying to write this class assignment wondering what I think the future will hold, what the human species will achieve, and what I will personally accomplish by the time I am 60. But to be honest, it is hard, it is hard to remain optimistic right now with everything happening in 2020, but I’ll try. 
                                     <br><br>

I am hoping, praying that by the time you are reading this, the worry I have will seem almost humorous, and the optimism I portray for the future is admirable, because I hope that the fairytale comes true. We save the planet just in time, like in the last moment when the buzzer was about to go off we shoot the winning basket and manage to win the race/fight against climate change. Writing about this, even thinking about this now with all the climate skeptics and the power of the republicans in the government seems naive and almost trivial. But I really pray that you are living a healthy, meat-free life and walk your little puppies every morning and still have the same energy you had when you were my age, biking everywhere and just enjoying life!
                                     <br><br>

Well here it goes, in 2020 BERNIE SANDERS WINS!!! He, along with his expert team of climatologists and politicians work together, not against each other to find the perfect long term solution to the climate crisis. This is called “the Sander’s green bill” and it looks at making almost every aspect of our living more sustainable. By 2030, fossil fuels were completely phased out of the USA, China, and India and by 2035, the entire planet was on sustainable, clean energy. Solar is a big one, I actually had the privilege of installing my own solar farm in the backyard, which I am sure you remember, and I hope you have maintained (maybe even expanded). The US in particular also began to use a lot of other forms of energy like wind, geothermal, even nuclear in some cases, the 2020s were truly seen as revolutionary, the savior years I wanna call them. 
                                     <br><br>

Now focusing more on me and what I have done personally. Taking this class in my winter quarter during my freshman year at UCSB, I thought I was just going to be taking an easy G.E class that fulfilled a lot of requirements and I had read some good reviews about the class, so I was excited to take a fun G.E. Little did I know that this class was quite possibly going to be one of the most influential classes I have ever taken in my whole time at UCSB and almost set off some kind of chain reaction in me where I became more and more interested in climate change. I became involved in the UCSB group that focused on making UCSB a more sustainable school, and one that looked at climate change as just as important as any other subject/ topic. Along with the help of many students, by the time I graduated, we convinced the university to make a class about climate change a necessary general education requirement for all students in the entire UC system. Therefore, the students not only had to learn about American history but also about climate change. This was quite possibly one of the most influential things that I have accomplished during my time at UCSB. The students might have detested us for a while after realizing that we were adding an additional requirement for them, but we found a way to stop that from happening by coupling a lot of climate change classes with other A-G requirements so that two birds can be killed with one stone. Students could learn about climate change in a scientific perspective, in a literature perspective (like I am now), in a manner that focuses on the history of climate change, a way that focuses on art and climate change, etc, etc, the point is that we made it very hard for the coming generation to escape learning about climate change and its importance. This was one step towards eliminating the skeptics and starting to focus our holistic attention not on convincing people that climate change is real, but working together to combat climate change. And that is exactly what happened with a more educated workforce, by 2030, almost all high schools, universities, colleges in California, New York, Florida, Washington, and many other states were required to provide mandatory climate change classes to their students, in whatever form they wanted to. And by 2035, the Leonardo Di Caprio administration (he became president), created a universal middle school and high school curriculum about climate change, so that all students around the US received the same quality of education, especially when it came to the problems of climate change. 
                                     <br><br>

Now that I am done about my little rant about the importance of education, I also wanted to let you know about the changes I made in my life. If you talked to me before 2020 about becoming vegetarian, I would’ve laughed at you and proceeded to eat a burger, but after a couple years I completely fazed out all of the meat from my diet, then all dairy products, then became a climatarian. It was tough and it was even harder to explain to my very middle eastern family why I was doing what I was doing and the importance of it. 
                                     <br><br>

Thank you for listening to my time capsule letter to me essentially, I really hope that you (me) were extremely successful, happy with your life and are continuing to live your life in a way that is sustainable, not only for the climate but for yourself!

How did we get here? Everything just went...so wrong…but if I had to pinpoint a singular moment, it would have to be when Bernie Sanders lost the Democratic nomination. Sure the Coronavirus caused widespread panic, but it was nothing compared to what was to come. 
                                     <br><br>
Bernie had inspired so much hope in the youth and his policies actually aimed at fixing the climate crisis. But, it was simply not enough. The media continued to portray Joe Biden as the superior choice despite the ever-growing concern over his mental health. Bernie’s loss, completely crushed those hoping for real change. When the time finally came for Biden to go up against Trump, it was clear that he was no longer in the right mind to carry out such an important role. As a result, Trump won by a landslide. Shortly after, Bernie Sanders passed away. All of it was just...too much for the people to handle. 
                                     <br><br>
What started out as peaceful marches quickly turned to riots across the nation. The youth had finally had enough of the inaction, we needed change now and we knew that Trump’s administration would not deliver. We really tried to keep the demonstrations peaceful, but the anxiety and fear of the oncoming climate crisis was too much to bear, not only that but the police surrounding us and making us feel like criminals didn’t help the situation. Soon, the riots became bloody struggles between the protestors and the police...many people lost their lives. This, however, made people even angrier and protests continued to grow in intensity. Eventually, the government became involved, promising to pass laws that aimed to solve this climate issue. But when the time finally came to sign the bill, the president vetoed it. We had finally accepted the fact that this government would not be willing to make the necessary changes so we were determined to make them ourselves. Not only did we aim at disbanding fossil fuel extraction, but the more extremists in our movement wanted to overthrow the entire government. Enough was enough, and what the people did next was something that we would soon come to regret. 
                                     <br><br>
Groups rallied in California and came up with a ridiculous idea to protest at the white house. This caused thousands of people to gather...to this day we don’t know who shot first, but it quickly became a massacre. The government feigned innocence despite the thousands of lives lost. The social unrest was painfully clear now, and countries across the globe were disgusted by the government’s actions, some even promised to support us. Somehow this environmental movement had turned into a civil war rooted in California. The millions of residents in California were calling for their independence, knowing that we could no longer bear being a part of such a corrupt country. This was supposed to be a way for us to become a more sustainable country, yet it became something very different. We had completely lost sight of what we were originally fighting for. 
                                     <br><br>
As the government began to rally some troops to put California back in its place, we too came to terms with the fact that we would now have to fight. However, when the war did begin, it was no longer the US vs California, but it instead gained the attention of the whole world. The enemies of the US saw it as an opportunity to defeat this giant. China started by sending resources to California, and Russia promised to send guns and men. California and the neighboring states became a battlefield where hundreds of thousands lost their lives. Millions fled to Canada and Mexico, but by then they had already started to close off their borders in fear of overpopulation and becoming involved. The US was being attacked by two powerful nations, so the UK promised to lend a hand. Each side began to gain more allies until it became the start of the third world war in the span of only 3 years. 
                                     <br><br>
The US started using propaganda, claiming that the country’s integrity was at stake and that they needed the support of the American citizens. The government once again passed a military draft, this time including women between the ages of 21 to 35. All the resources were set aside for the military and the American people were switched to jobs that in some way advanced “the cause.” Some worked in the media, others worked hard to make more weapons. Each side would make deadlier nuclear bombs, with the threat of using them against the other side and with each passing year, the stakes would just get higher and higher. No single side was winning, each week one side would suffer some loss. The whole world became a battleground. WW3 quickly became the most destructive and bloodiest war to date. Finally, after 4 years, the US dropped its newest nuclear bomb on Russia. Millions of Russians were killed, the majority of them were civilians. Russia followed suit by creating an even bigger bomb and completely wiping out New York in the process. Entire cities gone in a matter of seconds. It had become clear that in this war there would be no winner. 
                                     <br><br>
In 2030, the world came together to stop the senseless fighting, but the damage had already been done. Billions of people were killed in the name of this war, and the world was forever changed. The US was now a pathetic piece of land completely devastated and it would be years before it would be returned to its former glory. The entire world had to pay the price, and for the next 30 years, everyone avoided conflict. No country would ever be the same again.
                                     <br><br>
To this day, people look up at the sky expecting a bomb to come crashing down at any minute. We are now the generation of people terrified that today will be our last. But hey, we got what we wanted right? The world is no longer overpopulated, and the majority of people consume less than half of what we did 40 years ago. This is all environmentally friendly right?
                                     <br><br>
I’m not sorry for wanting better from our government, but I am sorry for how we went about it. You guys will never get to experience the sweet feeling of security or safety within this country you call “home”, and for that, I am truly sorry.

The year 2020 has had a start to its year like no other and will go down in the history books for the events of climate, pandemic and politics that is taking place. Life has taken turns that has thrown us out of our daily routines and to realize that that world events means we are all truly connected. Remember this and apply this truth with how you act to others and the environment. To treat everything that you come across as something in a cycle that will come back to you will guide you towards a path of goodness for all. Once the events of 2020 were over and life went back to normalcy, keep in mind that there are still actions that need to take place to make life safe for all. 
                                     <br><br>

Climate Chane will still be a major issue unless acted on. Eating how we did in 2020 will not be a sustainable way to continue living on Earth. Diets must be changed in order for the survival of our planet. It can and must be done through positive societal changes in standards for what is mainstream to eat! Do not give up hope that Earth cannot be saved because of human activities that are damaging every aspect of it.  Ride your bike around and find alternative ways to travel long distances. Experience life like you never have before in the name of the climate! Inform others about what is going on with our planet and help those who do not understand the true severity of what will happen to us if no action is taken. 
                                     <br><br>

Action can take its biggest place with voting and being involved in any way with decisions made by government officials. Talk to those in power and make your voice be heard that if there is something you do not like. There will be times when you may not be heard but that is more of a reason for you to organize and be seen. Be the change that is needed for our planet to live on.

The rapidly evolving circumstances of the coronavirus and the cancellation of an entire school quarter really made me reflect on how we should cherish the opportunities we have to interact with people around us when we usually wouldn’t think twice about it. I guess this also ties back to the idea of how Ken mentioned it is essential and crucial to build a community that’s tight-knit and resilient to issues like climate change and even this.

Your comment also just made me wonder how these pandemics are only going to occur more frequently and evolve themselves as advancements in medicine continue and the climate crisis worsens, but at the same time I wonder if it is a good thing to the planet. For example, citizens of Beijing, the capital of China, have been seeing blue skies since the outbreak of coronavirus as factories in the city stopped operating.

In the year 2020 I dreamed of a world where people came before money, communities were strong, public transportation was the only form of travel, oil companies no longer ruled, and everyone ate for the climate. Currently it is 2060, and while this dream of mine isn't the current reality, it shares many similarities to the world today. People today heavily use renewable energy, and while oil is still minorly used, the oil companies no longer rule the world. Cars are still used, but they are all chargeable and don't run on gas. Public transportation has grown to support the whole country and most people use it on the daily. Communities have not always flourished, but I can say that mine has. Overall people are much happier and feel more secure in the country we live in now, but how did we get here? In 2020 the U.S.A. elected Bernie Sanders to be our president. We were fed up with the current state of the country, for many reasons, especially in regard to the climate. This brought a wave of environmental progression. President Sanders began the reconstruction of public transportation. He made it more plentiful and incentivized people to use mass transit by heavily increasing gas prices. While this was all great, Sanders received a lot of backlash from Congress and was held at a standstill for many policies he wanted to implement. I took this as motivation to start making changes in my own life. In 2021 I took the step to turn from flegan to vegan. This was difficult for me at first, but has been so rewarding in the long run. Something important I learned in my climate crisis class in college was to wait for those around me to ask about my eating habits rather than telling everyone who didn't ask that I was vegan. In doing so I inspired friends and family around me who often challenged themselves to try a plant-based diet. However this wasn't enough for me. I wanted to do more to help combat the climate crisis. I joined eco-vista at my school and fell in love with environmental activism. I carried my message and passion with me everywhere I went and informed as many people as I could. My second year of college was my first time leasing a house. I was so excited to practice the community I have always wanted to see. I introduced myself to all my neighbors and began hosting dinners where we could all strengthen the community where we lived. I carried this tradition with me everywhere I lived after this point. This helped me fulfill my dream of strong communities. While I was working on personal environmental growth, so was my generation across the globe. People the same age as me simultaneously stopped eating meat, stopped using cars, began informing those around them, and slowly we started to see a change in our culture. The older generations were listening to us and following our lead. Soon climate change was widely accepted and feared. Everyone knew action had to be taken. The climate strike that began with students spread across the globe, everyone was demanding change from their governments. In the United States, the Green New Deal was finally passed. We saw a massive transition from our oil reliance to renewable energy. We saw communities regain strength. Flint, Michigan finally got clean and safe water. Some places were outraged, they didn't want to give up their way of life. These people and oil companies fought back and ultimately stopped the United States from becoming totally green. Beef manufacturers are still in business, but vegetarian and vegan options are much more plentiful now. Our country still has a long way to go in order to combat this climate crisis, but I am proud of my generation. We decided to collectively fight back and didn't stop until our voice was heard.
                                     <br><br>
As for me, once I graduated college I joined the Peace Corps and helped underserved communities around the world. This inspired me to continue meaningful work. I got a job working with animal conservation in spite of the warming planet, but continued volunteering to restore habitats in my local area. My friends and I continue striving for change, and prove this through our activism and efforts to show why communities are important. As a freshman in college sitting in my climate crisis class, I would hear my professor apologize because his generation knew about the climate crisis and continued to do nothing about it. I would not let that be the same as my generation, and I'm glad to say it wasn't.

Do you remember what life was like during your winter quarter ‘20 here at UCSB? Well, you decided to enroll yourself in this class titled English 23 (aka “the Climate Crisis) because you needed it for a GE requirement & the rate my professor reviews seemed fairly good. What you did not know, was just how much this class would open up your eyes to what is really going on with the current state of our planet. At first you were reluctant to engage in this class because you didn’t feel as though its content was relevant to you, but in retrospect you realized that it gave you powerful knowledge that was time sensitive. This class really opened your eyes up to the dire issue that is the escalating climate crisis. Sure you had heard of ‘global warming’ before, but you now realize that it is far more than what meets the eye. On top of that, you are so much more conscious of ways that you and so many others around you can help alleviate this crisis at hand. With this newfound knowledge, you have began to encourage people to go out and vote about issues that are vital to sustaining our planet and accommodating all of the people on it. You have decided to take steps to personally reduce your own carbon footprint, such as reducing your food waste. You even tried to go vegetarian for a month haha! Even though you only lasted a week and 2 days, it is important to note that at least you have made an effort to change. Who knows, maybe by the year 2060 you will be vegan.
                                     <br><br>
 Right now there is a lot happening in the world because there is a virus circulating that is called the “coronavirus/covid-19” which has sent the world into global panic. People are quarantining themselves and stocking up on supplies as if the world is ending (all you stocked up on was the energy flavor of vitamin water haha). Having taken Eng23, you view this sort of global issue in so many new ways that you probably would not have even considered before taking this course. To begin, you hope that people do not over stock on items just to let those items perish, thus immensely contributing to the global food waste that is already happening far too often. You also hope that people realize how to manage their food in a time that may introduce food rationing, and that they learn how to stick with this newfound knowledge of food preservation; even after this Coronavirus hysteria blows over. In addition to this, you are blown away to see that it took such crazy circumstances in order for people to reduce the amount of air travel that they partake in. This is the first time that you have seen such cheap flights for round trips to places like Hawaii or even Europe. This just comes to prove that it is possible to greatly reduce things that people claim they ‘cannot live without’. 2020 you does hope that this coronavirus pandemic does blow over soon and that it shows people just how bad things can get in a time of crisis; which is what the climate crisis can lead to.
                                     <br><br>
 All I can tell you, Chelsea of 2060, is that I sure hope things have taken a turn for the better by the time you’re reading this. It is difficult to think that the world will change for the better in my lifetime, but all I can do is have hope and try my best to contribute to a positive change. Even if things are still spiraling, I just want you to do your best to continue to voice the need to save our planet for future generations. Knowledge is power.

It is now the year 2060 and it has been incredible to see not only the changes enacted by people but by the planet itself. For the longest time, we did nothing. We mistook advances in the market economy, in consumerism, and even in technology as the pathway towards a brighter future. We were wrong. Sea levels rose, forests and crops burned, and CO2 continued to pollute our atmosphere, perpetuating these environmental injustices. These dangers not only affected humans, but the nonhumans who lived in harmony with the planet. We lost hundreds of species a day, livestock were raised only to be slaughtered in masses, we lost the coral reefs, and mercury poisoned the fish. Mother Earth was so hurt, she struck us with something smarter than the humans that were trying to kill her. 

                                     <br><br>

In 2020, the global population was struck with the Coronavirus. Hundreds of thousands were infected with the disease and millions felt the impact of its spread throughout the world. Thousands of lives were taken. To respond, travel bans were implemented. That meant less airplane flights, which meant reduced CO2 emissions. Factories were shut down, radically reducing methane gases being released into the atmosphere. Scientists all over the globe came together and worked on a solution to this problem. Meanwhile, Mother Earth used this time to heal. Politicians and world leaders began to realize that they were at the mercy of something much greater than a corporate executive's fat checks. They began to understand that they were at the mercy of another, more powerful living thing. That they were a part of this one giant ecology. 
                                     <br><br>


People began to elect officials who were most aware of this fact. President Trump caught the virus and lost his life in a foolish endeavor to frame himself as more powerful than the forces of nature. Soon enough, the Green New Deal that politicians heavily debated as a political issue rather than an environmental one was implemented. The US and soon enough the rest of the world began to turn to renewable energy. Public transportation was better funded and improved, and less cars were on the road. If there were a car on the road, it ran on electricity. Gas stations closed down slowly but surely. More people rode their bikes. More people became more conscious of their diet, and began supporting more sustainable diets. Fast fashion died out and sweatshops closed down. As wealthier countries felt the wrath of the virus and of the Earth's response to their carelessness, they understood the plight brought down on poorer countries. The entire globe began to feel like more of a community. Leaders began to care more about humanity itself than the GDP values imposed on them. 
                                     <br><br>

And now in 2060, we can breathe easier, with much cleaner air at that. We've ensured a future for generations to come. We've come to understand the greater oneness we should feel with all living things around us. We've understood the fragility of this oneness and its immense, ethereal beauty. We've come to realize our love for this planet and for every living thing in it.

To 2020 me, 
                                       <br><br>

In the year 2020, you decided to slowly make changes to your lifestyle including your diet. Cutting out red meat was the first change, it wasn’t too difficult, but you failed many times until you finally got it right. Having watched films like Cowspiracy and learning how damaging to the environment the meat industry, you finally stopped making mistakes. Cutting out meat was a small act, so you slowly but surely transitioned into a plant based diet. You helped your friends and family members to vegan meals, demonstrating how delicious and environment friendly they were. As a result, you were able to help others make this transition. Also, your clothing choices were no longer the same. Fast fashion was a big no. You did your research on which companies used sweatshops, and researched the conditions under where those workers worked. You used clothes longer, you bought less clothes. You bought simple pieces of clothing that were versatile and could be used year round for many years to come. You thrifted lots of your clothing, instead of donating clothes to be sold, you gave them to families in need that could actually make use of them. Your family also began to do the same.  
                                     <br><br>
 
2020 was one of the most important years of your life, especially when it came to politics. You were a sophomore at UCSB, had just turned 20, and finally had the chance to cast your vote for the Democratic Primary. You were and will always be a Bernie Sanders supporter. He was one of your role models, a man who always stood up for what’s right even when it was not popular to do so, a man who had the chance to become the Democratic Nominee and become President. In the year 2020, you took political action by phone banking (Spanish and English), canvassing, and helping those close to you register to vote. You voted for Bernie, and he won California, the state with the most delegates to give. While Biden won more states over Sanders, you never lost hope, no matter how many times CNN and other media said “Bernie is so far down in delegates”. You kept doing your part by campaigning. The Progressive movement won, Bernie became the 46th President of the United States of America. Democrats took control of the Senate and the White House. Under the Sanders administration, changes were made, but slowly enacted because the world still feared change. Bernie was re-elected in the year 2024 and more progressive changes were made. For example, states began to ban fracking entirely and a carbon tax was introduced entirely to the U.S. Bernie kept his promises of Medicare for all and Student Debt Elimination.
                                     <br><br>
 
In the year 2027, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announced she was going to run for President. The amount of support she received was amazing to see. You did exactly what you had done 8 years ago, you campaigned for her as much as you could. You made calls, canvassed, and held events at your home to inform undecided voters about the policies AOC planned to introduce when elected. 
                                     <br><br>
The Progressive Movement kept growing and the highest voter turnout was recorded in the general election in the year 2028. It was a historic moment. AOC became the first Progressive, Latinx, Woman President in U.S. history. During Ocasio-Cortez’s Presidency (she served for 8 years), lots of immediate changes took place. The Green New Deal was pulled off to an extent like never before imagined. You may ask what happened? Well over 20 million jobs were created, food waste decreased drastically, fracking was banned entirely in the U.S., slowly stopped burning fossil fuels, etc. There was a greater young voter turnout, the youth decided to take action because it was their future and they would decide how it should look like. 
                                     <br><br>
 
Imaging what the future we want can look like is easy, actually getting it to be like that takes work. It is not easy, but it is possible. When I was young, I thought owning mansions, and materialistic things would take over. However, I was wrong. My generation decided materialistic things do not determine happiness, many of those in fact, damage our planet and future of our kids. Micro-apartments were used more, electric cars and bikes were used more frequently, many cut out meat entirely from diets. If action would have been taken 40-50 years before 2020, the world would have been different. The struggles that many developing countries encountered because of countries like the U.S. would have been minimized. Change is better late than never, and I am so thankful we decided to act immediately. You are now 60, about to be 61, but just know your actions were important and valued. You raised children and grandchildren to also share the same values you did, who now look up to you. Like Bernie and your parents were your role models, you are now theirs. Politics played a huge part of your life, and it still plays a major part in your family’s. You did everything you could, and now it is time for the youth to do the same. Just know that the planet is in good hands, the Progressive Movement still lives on.

The year is now 2060. I can’t believe the Green New Deal was enacted forty years ago today… and it really took a devastating pandemic for people to realize their impact on our environment.
                                     <br><br>


In case you don’t remember, a multitude of COVID-19 cases took over Wuhan, China around mid-December. This felt like such a far-away matter for you, so you found no point in agonizing over it. But, soon enough, when classes and finals (at your university AND nationwide) were pushed to “remote instruction” in March, that’s when it really hit you. This virus wasn’t just a foreign issue-- it was affecting you and your friends now. When you left campus during finals week, you roamed around your neighborhood shops. Not a single soul or vehicle could be found. The streets were silent. People had already finished stocking up on last-minute items at retail and warehouse stores: toilet paper, water, hand sanitizer, rice… you name it.

                                     <br><br>

During the first few months of 2020, when the disease reached Washington state and began to spread throughout the country, scientists started to research the economic slump and actually forecasted a massive reduction in our carbon footprint. Although the epidemic had dramatically decreased in severity throughout the next few months following March, a ban on professional gatherings and meetings meant online conferences or simple email updates, people were able to work from their personal spaces, and motor traffic sharply declined. Despite the seemingly insignificant measures and precautions being taken, I remember thinking to myself, “why couldn’t we have come to this realization sooner?”

                                     <br><br>

Because of this devastation, we were able to clean up our act. Politicians began to realize the importance of climate change and even likened it to the virus itself: deadly-- remaining unnoticed until we couldn’t possibly afford to ignore it for any longer. All in all, what Professor Hiltner said all those years ago-- it’s true. All of it.

Generation  Z,                                      <br><br>

We have finally become the people we once laughed at and blamed for all of our problems, the baby boomers. Our story however is much different than theirs. It is the year 2060 and finally, our society has sprung into a new age, free of our parochial minded leaders and their peers, so earnestly stuck in the past. In this year, 2060, we have reinvented what it means to pursue the American dream and have instilled a more unified and empathetic idea of what it means to be an American into our children's minds as well.
                                     <br><br>


In the year of 2020, we KNEW that our society, and even more direly, our planet were calling for change. Although new, this change was not as radical as everyone once thought. Unfortunately, this change to a more sustainable society was very slow, perhaps too slow according to some. Starting in about the year 2040, after many years of explicit call for clean energy reform and lifestyle change with little success, waves of tumultuous environmental catastrophes began to affect our planet's human beings in ways that could no longer be ignored. Severe hurricanes began appearing so frequently that many coastal cities were being abandoned and ruined to a point deemed unsafe for people to inhabit, wildfires began incessantly burning precious forests, and our food sources were becoming so genetically modified that they no longer tasted the same as they did in 2020. Only then, when the American people were being directly affected by their unsustainable actions, is when true change finally began to catch on. 

                                     <br><br>

A new era of legislation began in 2040, finally moving past the decades old partisan gridlock, that worked to get our society where we needed to be. Every single American was now educated and informed about all the logistics and true science associated with the climate. A devout carbon tax was effectively implemented and forced our industries and leaders to rely on different sources of energy such as solar, hydroelectric, hydroelectric and geothermal. Although this energy change was great, what was even greater was watching the American people rally behind each other in order to combat such a severe crisis to our people. Time and time again, the American people have proved resilient and welcome to change in times of need; much like the corona virus pandemic situation in 2020. This time around however, we have leaders who are educated, and willing to unify ALL types of people together to promote change. In the midst of the climate crisis, people began realizing that they could no longer continue living as they had been. There became nationwide trends of people only eating beef three times a week at maximum, and taking family vacation more apt to  biking and walking as opposed to flying, and a common theme of families buying less clothes throughout the year. 

                                     <br><br>

It is 2060, and the times have definitely changed since I was 20 in the year 2020. Although life is no longer able to accommodate the fast paced consumerism and fossil fuel activities I grew up around, life is definitely not any worse than it was back then, just different. America, one of the leaders of GHG emissions was able to transform, but only with the help of every individual, no one government leader could solve this issue. Now we can only offer our insight and resources to aide the developing world into transitioning in a manner that bypasses the severe consequences we lived through.

Interestingly, I also mentioned similar points in my comment earlier. We would only see slow progress to save the climate as of now, but I believed people will start to come together as their self-interests are damaged and threatened due to impacts like sea-level rise and natural disasters from climate change. Unless climate change gets to the point where it can no longer be ignored and ridiculed by those who benefit from  aggravating climate change, a cultural shift would not take place. However, once a movement takes place and there is collective will to push for the safety of all people and the well being of the environment, the progress is bound to be unstoppable. This kind of cultural shift will eventually make everybody accustomed to live sustainable lifestyles and in turn encourages more people who haven’t done so already. A cycle is formed to push for even more progress.

To my future self:

                                     <br><br>

It is currently 2020. The presidential election is a few short months away, which will spur the United States' battle against the climate crisis. However, it starts off slow but steady. Bernie Sanders, the man who would've abruptly changed the course America was on, loses to Joe Biden. Being the more moderate candidate, Joe Biden says he will do as much as he can to introduce renewable energy and tax carbon polluters, yet still believes nuclear power plants should remain in operation and not completely banning fracking. Ultimately, his presidency doesn't result in anything remarkable regarding the climate crisis. Yes, he decides to rejoin the Paris Agreement, yet this agreement does not actually force a country to follow its rules. The Green New Deal is addressed in the House of Representatives, which still holds a large democratic majority. With modifications and new additions, it sweeps through the House of Representatives and the Senate. But, Joe Biden does not pass it; he is again urged by his supervisors and powerful figures to do what is best for Capitalist America and save the economy. More natural disasters occur over the years, sea level rises wiping out many cities and islands, and the population grows exponentially. The affects of climate change are entirely visible; there are little to few deniers by 2030. However, the American government is still struggling to grasp the shift to a more socialist form of government, something that is completely foreign to all. 

                                     <br><br>

Years go by and more funding goes into battling the climate crisis. The wealthy are becoming more educated and aware of their actions, and some are willing to shift to a socialist way of life. There are some, though, who are not willing to give up their financial worth. There is a slight decline in consumerist culture and people have begun to eat largely plant based diets, but with the slightly limiting regulations on fracking, people use their cars the same amount as they did in 2020. A large amount of the population shifts to electric cars, thinking they are benefiting the environment, however they are unaware of it producing practically the same amount of waste during production as a regular gas car. The educated begin to take the issue more seriously, whereas the least educated Americans are still confused on the issue. Thankfully, most of the world adapted to a more socialist society and begins to successfully decrease their emissions, but America remains pretty stagnant. Our emissions aren't rising, but they are definitely not lowering as much as we needed. After Biden leaves office, a man who emulates Bernie finally enters. This man, who could possibly belong to my generation, makes the changes to the country needed to reduce CO2 emissions to our present goal. He bans fracking, communities become more involved, and America is almost shifted away from the old American dream to a new one: a fully operating world, government, and workplace that is actively saving the planet one day at a time. I really hope I am right, and if not, it is up to the next generation to make the active change.

I am writing to inform go you of how much has changed with the planet and with yourself from 2020 to 2060. You have just came back from a lunch with 6 of your college friends, whom a majority of them you convinced to make some sweeping changes in their life that would help save the planet. I want to let you know that many of the things you learned in Ken Hiltner's class you adopted into your own lifestyle. I know that in 2020 when you were taking this class, you were unsure if you would be able to implement any of the lifestyle changes you learned throughout the entire course. You became a full on vegetarian about a year after taking Ken's class your second quarter of sophomore year. It took you awhile to get the hang of becoming a vegetarian. You also convinced a very small percentage of your family to take on becoming vegetarian. Im sorry it could not have been more but you know how much your family loves meat so this is probably not a big surprise. I know that you would continuously doubt that you could ever become one, despite you not being very fond of meat. Your college roommate helped a lot with you making the change, despite her not taking the course because she would always guilt you into eating your vegetables. You soon enough realized that a plant-based diet was just as good as any meat. I know it may be annoying, but please bear with her. In the future you will be forever grateful that you did.
                                     <br><br>

As for the state of the climate crisis. Everyone eventually woke up. It took until the temperature reached the temperature set at the Paris Accords to do so however. Once that temperature had reached people were beginning to realize that many of the natural disasters were worsened by climate change. The climate still isn't perfect. There still is much to be done. Right now we are about the same state with the climate crisis as you were when taking your climate crisis class. It took a long time for people to realize that this was an issue in need of fixing. Bernie Sanders being elected as president did help prevent the climate crisis because he helped to pass legislation to mitigate it. Many big oil companies were being fined for the amount of CO2 they were putting into the atmosphere so their emissions decreased drastically. This being said we are still not in a state where we do not need to do anything regarding the climate crisis at the moment. The direction of the climate crisis can change quickly if we begin to think this way. You still discuss the climate crisis with your family members and some of your coworkers and many of them have this dangerous mindset. They believe that since we are slowly getting better in terms of the climate crisis that now we can go back to the ways we used to behave before the climate crisis.
                                     <br><br>

You have also been successful in switching to a minimalist lifestyle. I bet you are surprised to hear this one, being that you are probably at home sitting in a room with a closet that is overflowing with clothes. You ended up giving many of your clothes to local thrift stores and the iv. bank. I advise you start to plan what you want to give because, trust me it will take a while. You used to bike to your job at the bank everyday being that you lived 20 minutes biking time from it. On rainy days you would just take the bus. You were able to retire about 5 years earlier than you would have because of you not needing a car. You are happy and healthy. You do a much better job at determining what you need and what you want when going shopping. You had a car right out of college but gas prices began to increase and you decided that you hated driving so you ended up selling back your car and switched to mass transportation and biking.
                                     <br><br>

I know at the moment all may seem helpless but trust me it will get better. You just must be willing to set goals for yourself and stick to them and hope that people will follow you as an example.

Dear Children,
                                      <br><br>

Hey you guys it’s Dad here writing to you with some rather unfortunate news. Just to put some things into perspective it is the year 2060 and I never would have thought in a million years that I would have to be writing to you in this way. As I am sure you can see on the news the past few weeks have been absolutely devastating to watch as another fire has burned up much of what is left of California. I am sure you have many questions because for the beginning portion of your life it seemed that everything seemed not great, but okay. I do not believe I have told you this story from my college days, but anyways my second year of school I received an email from a professor I had once had. He was letting me know of this climate change class that he was offering for the first time in winter of 2020. I was hesitant at first as it did not necessarily cover the requirements I needed to have done but I decided to enroll anyways because of the respect I have for my professor, his name was Ken. Anyways, this class was called Climate Crisis 101, I am sure you kind of understand where I am going to go with this but please continue to read. As I am sure you remember me telling you, I was a climate change denier before coming to UCSB. I believed it to be a rather political agenda that truly did not affect our environment. Luckily enough, by taking this class not only did it change my mind, but it reset the course of my life 100%. If it was not for this course you guys I would have an unthinkable amount of guilt on my conscious knowing that my time may be up soon and leaving you in this hell on earth. I can honestly say that I tried everything I could from an individual standpoint to be as clean and healthy with our family since before your mom and I decided to have you guys. Although I tried my absolute hardest I cannot say the same for the rest of my generation or even the few before us. You guys are smart and I am sure that you’ve heard this in several of your classes throughout the years, but what we all believed to be the pivotal point that doomed us in the end was the 2020 presidential election. This election is when Donald Trump was reelected into office and quite honestly won by a landslide. 
                                     <br><br>
 
Now that you are more aware of the situation let me continue writing about why things turned out the way that they did. What Trump’s reelection did for our society and the world was give permission to continue to live in such ugly ways. Many people, even climate activists, at the time decided to give up on the topic as they also begin to see the luxurious lives provided by the burning of fossil fuels and other major greenhouse gas emissions in our atmosphere. As many peoples guards were let down and no signs of real disaster seemed to be happening. Most people decide to live normal, non-conscious lives in regards to the environment which you saw many of your friends doing. I understand at times in your childhood when you thought I was crazy for your mom and I’s extreme rules about certain things, but I promise you it was for your own safety. Now you see the government enforcing many of the “house rules” we had in our household when you guys were little kids. The disaster of climate change never really left us even though we ignorantly left it. I learned several things from my climate crisis 101 class, but one that was definitely important was that climate change has a tendency to have a delayed effect. When I was about your age the climate change issue was as big as ever, due to the generations before us not being cautious with their own greenhouse gas emissions we suffered from it. It was not nearly as bad as what you guys will be left with soon, but it was definitely a sign. I want to apologize on the behalf of my generation for not taking enough action to prevent this from happening. I would hope to understand that you guys know I did everything I possibly can since the moment I realized climate change was real. 
                                     <br><br>
 
As much devastation this brings to me I want you to understand that I love you guys and although we have managed to get this far in time we do not have much time left. I am left with sadness that we were not able to save the plant and everyone, not just one political party, has to suffer because of someone's actions back in 2020. It all began with the re-election of Trump when Bernie Sanders was the man who was going to save us from ourselves. Now that global population has risen to nearly 11 billion people it is without a doubt that lack of awareness led to this horrible disaster. I remember a time when the global temperature was 7 degrees lower than what it is right now, but even then it was an issue. It is painful to watch the government take radical approaches to barely be able to buy us a little bit more time when 40 years ago we could have shifted the pattern of this planet. Now you see why I did things a certain way for you guys growing up when it did not seem as commonly accepted by others. Not only was it for the good of the planet, but the good of our family. Please hug the ones who love and let them know how much you love them as I am doing to you right now because we do not know how much time we have left. 
                                     <br><br>
 
Love, Dad

Hey girl, how you doin? It’s 2060, Friends is back on Netflix, and we’re back to binging. So, I bet you’re wondering how things turn out. What’s the future like? How are you doing? You’re doing amazing sweetie. I know 2020 is a rough year, especially in the beginning. But things turn around! You’ll see. Here are some things coming up.
                                     <br><br>

Bernie doesn’t win. I know. It sucks. But next year, Biden passes away due to heart complications and things get better. The Green New Deal is in progress and the world is no longer freaking out over COVID-19. We sign the updated Paris Agreement, Trump dies out of anger and excessive spraytans. Renewable energy is back in style. Beyonce demands clean air and water. The world responds with clean air and water. The president has no power next to Beyonce. Beyonce becomes president. 
                                     <br><br>

You happily marry and have amazing kids. Of course, you’re only allowed to have two at this point because world population is rapidly increasing and they’re trying to get their shit back together at the moment. I think Coronavirus 2.0 might take care of that. Just kidding. But not really. It also broke out in America after air travel. Thankfully, AOC teams up with Beyonce to cancel old forms of air travel, modernize it to make it Earth-friendly, and it extremely helps our carbon footprint. 
                                     <br><br>

Big things happen that are out of your control. Additionally, you make the world a better place by what you decide to do on a day to day basis. I know it’s hard, but eventually you figure out how to cut back on meat and use fake meat to make those traditional Mexican plates mom taught us. You don’t go for the big house you’ve dreamt of. You go for a smaller place fit for you and your family, which grows veggies in the backyard and donates leftovers weekly. Life is good. It gets better. Have fun and keep making good decisions. I love you!

<p>
I am writing a message to you in the year 2060, forty years ahead of your time, 2020. I am aware of all the things you are currently going through: such as the global pandemic corona virus, the online finals you're most likely studying for currently, and how you're debating whether or not you should go home for the entire spring quarter. Nonetheless, I am writing this letter to you as an update, an insider scoop on how you should expect your life to be in 2060. 
                                     <br><br>

I'll start with 2020. In the year 2020, you took Ken Hiltner's UCSB course English 23, or better known as "Climate Crisis 101". This class taught you a lot about the environment, humans, pollution, the future of our planet, etc. You are inspired by the efforts of many individuals who motivate everyone to live for the Earth and the species that call it home. As a result, you are pushing yourself to do better. Starting with your diet, converting to being vegetarian and eliminating meats. In addition, minimalism. By the end of 2020, you will have reduced your belongings by half through donating and reselling them of course. You're way more eco conscious by the end of 2020, and you're proud. You learned a lot, but most importantly you applied what you learned. By 2030, you already graduated UCSB, the corona virus is in the past. Trump is out of office. We finally have a president who understands the severity of the climate crisis. For a while, the climate crisis isn't immediately going to get better. It's slow and steady, Mother Nature has a lot of healing to do, but with the right person in office, we are headed in the right direction. On top of that, the population has only been increasing, we expect a child limit to be placed in order to reduce carbon footprint and total emissions. However that probably won't be in place until the coming years. You have your first child, and you're a bit worried about where the future of this Earth is heading towards. You recall a moment from an lecture at UCSB, "by 2050, a majority of the population will be living in cities", and you wonder, if that's where you'll end up. There is officially a 2 child law to keep the population under control. Due to limited space, cities are now turning to micro apartments, they're everywhere because they need to be. Now, automobile transportation is the slowest form of transportation. The best transportation seems to be public due to the increasing number of households owning cars. CO2 emissions are still a big problem, and because of that, every major city in the world is on lockdown once every two months. This way, CO2 emissions are reduced immensely. 
                                     <br><br>

Fast forward to 2060, where I am right now. You have been committed to being vegetarian for as long as you can remember. You feel healthy. The Earth looks healthier. For now, due to a combination of strict laws and lockdowns, the Earth is starting to bounce back to where it once was before the climate crisis. However, the crisis is far from over, we are just starting to break ground and I can only hope that it goes well from here.

<p>
A message for 2060 and beyond:                                     <br><br>

Dear Future,                                     <br><br>


I have seen more sunsets than sunrises in my life and all those endless nights that pour into mornings makes me contemplate the meaning of life. We live in such a materialistic culture and that is just reality for who knows how long. Perhaps this is still the case for you. People are born in this world for an eventual, ultimate end of death. The only thing that remains is the physical impacts we leave which stays with us no matter how beneficial or detrimental the effect is. Don’t get me wrong and call me heartless when I say it is the only thing, but logically it is as people who remember will also move on with life and die. In fact, all life has an end which is just a matter of when. I am sure that the Earth will one day end too. It’s just a matter of when our home becomes uninhabitable to support any and all life forms due to crisis such as evolving viruses or changing environments. Presently, people find meaning through accomplishments especially through financial means as a way to be able to own a house, car, food, etc. materials. The reason why we choose a certain lifestyle is because it offers us something whether it is trying to be environmental-friendly or financially better off. Everyone lives life with a purpose, and it may seem like they know exactly what to do but everyday changes and nobody is able to predict what will come next. The way the Climate Crisis is accumulating in terms of problems is also the same as efforts bring no immediate results and the future remains unpredictable. To be honest, I am scared because I do not know what will happen to the world as many catastrophic events are occurring and will occur. I think I will continue contributing as best as I can, but it is truly difficult to expect outcomes when those that are not environmentally aware continue to do the opposite splurging without consequential thoughts.

Dear me,                                      <br><br>

The climate crisis was a hard ordeal to overcome. But we’ve made it this far since we’re in 2050. In 2020 we knew that the earth was warming. We knew about the possible effects if the planet continued to warm at the rate it was. We knew that it was anthropogenic and the many sources that contributed to it. We knew that the threat was imminent and needed serious action very quickly. Yet a lot people still remained passive. 
                                     <br><br>
In 2020 it took a massive campaign with support from young people and all sorts of activists to get Donald Trump out of office and elect Bernie Sanders to be President of the United States. No one saw that coming. Democrats also took back the Senate giving Bernie the backing needed to enact the Green New Deal. The US finally did something good for the planet and devoted more of its budget to combating climate change instead of the military. With the United States taking action to become more sustainable, other countries followed suit. Soon China, Europe and the United States were leading the global efforts in reducing their emissions greatly as they were the biggest offenders of emissions. They offered developing countries the support they needed to be able to develop sustainably with little social cost. 
                                     <br><br>
When I first learned about the details of the climate crisis in 2020 as a freshman in college it left a huge impact on me. I started to become more conscious of what I consumed; food and material goods. I grew up eating a lot of meat. I tried to change that. I stopped eating burgers in the dining halls. I tried to go for plant based options whenever I could. It took awhile but eventually I did eat a mostly plant based diet and it felt good. It caught on after a few years and the plant based diet trend expanded outside of California and became more mainstream. Bernie fought hard against climate change and through advice from climate scientists he recognized that cattle and livestock as a whole were huge emitters, so he stopped giving the beef industry and agricultural sector the huge subsidies they receive. Beef stopped being such a huge part of people’s diet. It was the hardest to change as people, especially Americans, didn’t like the idea of not having cheap beef like they grew up with. But to compensate, the beef industry and food corporations started investing into “Impossible” meats making meat substitutes. They made them so well people became accustomed and more accepting towards it. People were healthier as a result. 
                                     <br><br>
Bernie also came for the fossil fuel industry so we would stop relying on the energy that was killing the planet. This was also an uphill battle due to the power that the fossil fuel industry had in our country. He placed heavy taxes on them and took away their subsidies while investing into sustainable energy like solar, wind etc. With the government investments into sustainable energy, they were able to become cheap enough for everyone to use unlike how it was in 2020 back when they didn’t have the support of the government. Once we were finally able to wean off of fossil fuels other countries followed suit. We reinstated the bans on drilling offshore and in vulnerable areas like Alaska and the Arctic. 
                                     <br><br>
The bad side is that while we were able to make these changes, animals did perish in the short run. Species were going extinct and many more were on the brink of extinction due to overfishing in the seas and ocean acidification, receding habitat for Arctic creatures, and elsewhere. We are still working to bring back the biodiversity that was in the Amazon and restore it to its fullest by keeping it protected from deforestation under international law. But we have made great strides. We have implemented more sustainable fishing practices and kept our temperature from reaching over 2degrees so the sea levels have not risen excessively. The global community worked to expand the number of protected areas for animals to live without human interference or hunting. 
                                     <br><br>
In the midst of achieving all of these to combat the environmental issues we also took steps to fix the social issues that intersect with them. The expansion of clean energy created new jobs for people and encouraged education in that sector. We started taxing corporations their fair share and lowered the enormous income inequality that the US and the world as a whole was experiencing. We stopped the laissez faire approach to globalization and focused on fair trade. We worked to never have another Rana Plaza again. The global community put regulations on trade so people would not be exploited by corporations and left with no other options than to become slaves for the developed world to consume carelessly. The fast fashion industry became weaker and we managed our consumption and labor markets better. While the prices of things were more expensive due to carbon taxes and fair trade, global standards of living were better. We decreased the income inequality and redistributed the world’s wealth to all the people who lived on it, not just the 1%. The United States took more steps to work for its citizens by expanding social measures like education and healthcare allowing its people to thrive and work for better things. People were more productive once they had their basic needs met creating an efficient society. With the top 1% 's wealth decreasing, people started moving away from McMansions and started living in reasonable housing with a lot of people living in apartments in cities. When everyone’s basic needs were met and there were no more billionaires, people were able to focus on things that made them happy as our social safety net was large and we moved away from the association happiness had with money. 
                                     <br><br>
In 2050 our world is not perfect. It never will be. But we have made great strides from where we were in 2020; a paradox of awareness but passiveness. We have now put our knowledge into action by voting for the right leaders and personal and collective action. We worked furiously through lots of opposition to implement the policies surrounding food, energy and fair trade but we have accomplished a lot. The fight continues because we can never remain complacent, we have to keep bettering ourselves. But for now, we can say that we are still here in a world without imminent danger and have a world for future generations.

To whomever this may concern,
                                     <br><br>

Hello, I am currently a freshman at the University of California Santa Barbara and am taking English 23, also known at the time as Climate Crisis. While I do not think of myself as a die-hard climate activist like Greta Thunberg, I still believe that we should take care of our planet. I feel that even though things may not seem great right now, they will only get better, so I would like to make a prediction of what will happen over the next 40 years. While I cannot see the future, I feel that I can make a decent prediction based on what I know and how the world currently is, so here I go.
                                     <br><br>

The year is 2020, it is November and even though Bernie Sanders had a good run and even made it all the way to the presidential election, he still lost to Donald Trump. Donald Trump went on to be president for the entirety of his second term, but it was not quite the same as his first term. Many people of my generation, as well as a quite a large margin of people from the previous generations, began to protest the lack of action toward the protection of our planet. They gained a lot of attention and eventually made it all the way to the nation's capital. Backed by numerous senators and representatives of state, the protesters managed to force, maybe even convince somewhat, president Trump to take action in order to preserve the planet.
                                     <br><br>

While it was slow at first, many actions were being taken to lower carbon emissions. Public transportation was made easier and more efficient across the nation. Plus the extraction of oil became outlawed so very little people were buying their own cars. The people that used to work to extract oil now work to improve the public transportation system as well as other jobs that improve the environment.
                                     <br><br>

Now it is the year 2060 and everyone’s lives have drastically changed, but nobody seems  to mind. Nobody really eats meat or drives cars anymore since the alternatives were made better and more efficient. Everyone is a lot more environmentally conscious so the global emissions have drastically decreased. Everyone is happier and healthier. It's a good life.
                                     <br><br>

While this is just a prediction, I feel that this future is possible and even obtainable in the next 40 years. It will not be easy, but with enough hard work and awareness we as residents of the United States can be the example that sets the planet straight.

Dear 20 year old me,                                       <br><br>

I was raised to always leave things better than when I found them. I was taught to not be wasteful and to stay away from meat. I was told to treat others better than the treatment I received and to commit one act of selflessness a day. I was given values and morals and a good head on my shoulders- a good kid by definition. As I got older meat integrated into my diet, I became too “busy” for selfless acts, and taking care of the environment moved lower on my list of priorities. However, I maintained a steadfast moral code and kept true to my core values, never hesitating to help someone in need or put others before myself. It was these qualities that drove me to take Ken Hiltner’s climate crisis course during my sophomore year in college. I had many skeptics in my life on this subject and sought the truth. This course revealed the extent to which humankind had turned on its planet, the damage we had inflicted, and the costs we were all going to suffer if action was not taken. While I had my doubts on some of the topics, I saw the extremity and depth of the climate crisis and most importantly, that it was real.

                                     <br><br>

The problem is, I’m stubborn and hard-headed and set in my ways so of course I took my time. Nonetheless, I did act- I cut out meat, chose the bus over cars, reduced your waste, and told anyone who would listen about our planet in peril. As time went on, I continued my conscientious living, but knew it wasn’t enough. I was still feeding into the corrupt fashion and agriculture industry, driving to work, and travelling on holidays. At 30, we were still in the midst of a crisis, but developing technology had managed to curb disaster. 5 years later disaster did strike. Global temperatures finally reached a tipping point and many of our worst fears were realized. The ice caps melted and sea levels rose, wiping out thousands of coastal cities and villages. Fires were burning so big you could see them from space, diseases spread and wiped out millions, the world was imploding. 

                                     <br><br>

We thought it was over, that our lives here on Earth were finished. But somehow, a small breath of life was spared on this planet. Roughly 1/3 of the population survived and those of us left had to start again from scratch. Us survivors came together and helped each other begin again. We built sturdy houses from the ruined ones, planted gardens and sewed our own clothes. There were no more cell phones, no more mass production and mass waste, no more wealth and poverty. We were forced back into a life of simplicity, back into a life that aligned with our core values. It's now 2060 and the world is quite different from when you were in college. Everyone lives within modest means, families all grow their own food, repair their own things, and help those who can’t. It’s endlessly tragic that so many people had to die before we finally changed our ways. I believe just about everyone has morals, and when our actions don’t align with these morals, bad things happen. So many people were acting opposite their values, opposite basic human values, that we reaped the effects on a global scale. 40 years ago, all it would’ve taken was for people to start acting in line with these morals, and show some  human and Earth kindness, for disaster to be evaded. But people are stubborn and hard-headed and stuck in their ways and so we had to learn the hard way. If I could, I would tell 20 year old me to remember what her parents taught her, how they raised her to be loving and kind and to fight tooth and nail for what she believed in. Liani, dedicate your life to being selfless and compassionate, and make it your mission to leave this Earth a bit sweeter than how you found it. That is my message for you.

Letter to myself 40 years later:
                                     <br><br>

After 40 years, I will be 60 years old. Maybe, I will already retire? As a youth just entering college, I can hardly imagine what kind of life I will be living after 40 years. Will I be with my children and grandchildren at home, or will I still struggle for my career? But what I care more about is what kind of environment I live in. Scientists predict that if we do not significantly reduce carbon use by 2050, global temperatures will be too high and too many places will no longer be suitable for human habitation. At that time, will solar energy replace carbon as our main source of energy? Will we be able to have driverless cars, or faster and greener ways of travel? If none of this happens, what will the earth look like? Maybe when solar energy and other sustainable energy replace carbon, we will find other environmental problems?
                                     <br><br>
At 19, I became an environmentalist because of a course. Maybe my opinion on the professor in some aspects thinks that it cannot be achieved, but how much can we accomplish in the future? Will I be a persistent environmentalist for the next 40 years? Or, for the benefit, will I stand on the opposite side of environmental protection?
                                     <br><br>
No matter what I will become, I hope that our mother earth will be even more pure and clean in 2060 than now. Humans have demanded too much from the earth, and we deserve something in return. I believe that in the next 40 years, our lives will become better and better, leaving a better world for our children and grandchildren.

                                     <br><br>
Sincerely,
                                     <br><br>

A message from the future:
                                     <br><br>

The year is 2060. And as every year goes by, it is looking to be closer and closer to the end. To be clear, not the end of the Earth by any means. Nor the end of life by any means. But the end of intelligent life on Earth. I am writing this message in March. Back when I was a teenager, I remembered March for its cool Spring Breezes, beautiful flowers, and incessant rain. None of that happens any more. Rain hasn’t come in years. Like how as a teenager I had never been in snow, growing up in the warm climate of California, my grandchild has never been in rain, growing up in the hellscape of California. The ancient thermometer I have outside reads 96 degrees Fahrenheit-- and that is the coldest day we have had this week. My alma mater UCSB is submerged under the Pacific Ocean. All current forecasts indicate that our planet will be wholly uninhabitable by the turn of the century. 
                                     <br><br>

The turning point in our planet's history occurred after 2020-- when Donald J.Trump took office for a second term-- ushering in a populist red wave. The administration further politicized the issue of Climate Change, and entirely defunded the EPA. My college roommate and dear friend, a former professor of Marine Biology has retired after the last species of Coral went extinct. The organism he had dedicated well over 35 years of his life towards studying, became wholly unviable in the current climate. All conservation efforts had been doomed after the Coral population in the wild became disastrously low. Genetic Drift led to an extinction vortex buildup of detrimental alleles, making coral reproduction further and further unlikely. Finally even under laboratory conditions, coral could not be made to reproduce. Overcome with grief, he retired from his professorship. My other college roommate and dear friend lost his life in the protests of 2030-- trampled by a crowd of protestors fleeing from the riot police who had begun using real bullets instead of rubber ones. My ancestral village in India, is now submerged under water as well. My family had been forced to move north, along with 500 million other Indians. Two billion people live in an area that shouldn’t contain over 10% of that amount. Perhaps the future of our species lies with Elon Musk, who is still attempting to set up a base on Mars. However, progress is slow, and our future looks dim. Every year I wonder if this will be my last. When will I join my wife, who died a decade back? She, along with hundreds of thousands of others, passed away when a new strain of Malaria had begun to thrive in the United States due to the temperature increase. The only thing that keeps me going is my research. I work on a topic inconceivable 50 years ago, genetically engineering humans to be heat resistant. Countless attempts at isolating genes that should have worked, have all inevitably failed. It feels almost if I am not being allowed to succeed, my colleagues aren’t being allowed to succeed, as if Mother Earth herself is rejecting our attempts at prolonging our existence. Perhaps this really is our time to go, but I am not ready. We are not ready. I just wish we had done something about it when we could have.

To the youth, 
                                     <br><br>

It is 2060, AKA 40 years since I became a student at UCSB. Since earning my Bachelor’s Degree in Biopsychology, I’ve laughed, I’ve cried, I’ve made mistakes, but most of all, I’ve gained knowledge on the climate crisis. 2020 was the year I enrolled in English 23 (Climate Crisis 101), the year I became aware of the impacts of climate change, and how humans are the main cause of this detrimental occurrence. I never thought I’d take a class that related to the environment, but I did, and I’m so grateful for it. You might not know the severity of climate change because your middle school or high school has failed to educate you all about human impact on the environment, let alone mention it. I was literally a first year college student before I truly became aware of what climate change even was, so don’t be discouraged if this is the first you’re hearing about this. Becoming aware of the earth’s quick warming was very eye opening, and made me discouraged for the future of not just the United States, but the world. In this letter, I want to tell my story on my change in mindset, and hopefully inspire young minds to take action as climatarians. 
                                     <br><br>

Prior to coming to UCSB, I grew up in a small, agricultural town in the southern part of California’s Central Valley. It was definitely not grand, and the elementary, middle, and high school was definitely small compared to those surrounding the town. Leaving town for college was one of the best modes of change I could have had. When I say “change,” I mean change in lifestyle, environment, diet, and exposure to new people with fresh perspectives. Change was great, but change was still hard. Actually, it wasn’t hard, but a lot to process. It still is. When I first discovered the human impact of the increased carbon emissions in the air, I was honestly really ashamed of being human. Our basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing have been blown out of proportion to where the American Dream consisted of attaining more money to buy more food, buy a bigger home, and buy more and more clothes. Little did we know that this “dream” of ours was the biggest form of damage towards a healthy earth. What’s even worse is how American action affects other nations, especially developing countries. My eyes were opened to the devastating work industry in Bangladesh, poverty rates in India, and the never ending harm industrial work has on the tropical forests. I know this sounds super alarming; trust me, I know you feel! 
                                     <br><br>

I literally sound like my old climate crisis professor when I say this, but you need to VOTE! Youth participation in voting means everything to the climate crisis, and is the best step towards achieving the change we all know is possible. The first time I voted was for the 2020 presidential primary. Before college, I did not know the vast impact politics have on mitigating the climate crisis, and how my vote really makes a difference. I urge you to educate yourselves and others on what candidates promote a green, inclusive nation for the people! If you’re not old enough to vote, please utilize your resources to gain information on how you can lower your carbon footprint, and share it with others. Change starts with you!
                                     <br><br>

As of right now, I am 59 years young. It has almost been 60 years of living on this planet, and I have had the pleasure of being a spectator of youth activism and human thirst for change. I am happily married, living in a small urban home with minimal “things,” a pet dog and cat, and two children. When I was 18, I planned on having a grand wedding, four kids, and the biggest modern home I could afford to build. My dream was to live on the coast of Newport Beach, specifically in the Pelican Hill community. Looking back on it, I only had this mindset because as a teenager, I thought having luxury things and having more than the average human made me more successful in this life. I know you probably have that same mindset right now, and reading this might not be something that affects your future goals. 
                                     <br><br>

Yes, the earth has still gotten significantly warmer, but what I can say is there are so many individuals who are not only aware of climate change, but are altering their lifestyles to lower their carbon footprints. I know that looking into the future may be scary and uncertain, but just know that you have the power to create any change you want to see in your life. For me, I wanted to create change that would not only benefit me, but the environment, my family, friends, and future generations from today. Climate change is alive and kicking, and this subject should never fail to be a large focus in politics and youth education. I am very thankful to have had the opportunity to have gained the awareness and knowledge I have today, and I hope to have taught my children that life isn’t about what you have physically, but how much you’ve gained mentally. I am usually quite pessimistic about human action in regards to change, but I feel that many humans today are aware of what is happening, and truly believe in a prosperous earth.

Things only seemed to get worse after the year 2020. There was a mass pandemic spreading throughout the world. Our economy was in a bad place. People lost their jobs, their homes and their lives . Most politicians that got voted into office still ignored the topic of climate change and prioritized other things. Once things finally settled again a couple years later, we realized the climate issue had only worsened. I remember seeing the breaking news headlines on the news saying it was too late. I was angry. I was angry at myself for not doing enough. I was angry at everyone who called it a hoax. I was angry at the government. People all over the world were angry.But that anger didn’t stop us. It fueled us. We filled the streets and protested, demanding to be heard by our governments. While some people still resisted, the majority were scared as they saw the consequences of their actions right in front of them. The United States was losing its coastal cities. The oceans were being destroyed. There was not enough food to feed the world, let alone, livestock. Economies were crashing yet again. So much was happening at one time. But I’m proud to say that we didn’t fall into a time of war and destruction. In fact, it mobilized us to work together and find the solutions. The climate crisis unexpectedly brought the whole world together. I can’t say it was peaceful at first, but we were working on it. As a country, we were forced to make drastic changes in the ways we lived. However, we understood that it was the only option. It’s crazy how fast things change when people actually want to make the change. Within a year, the United States cut down their meat/dairy consumption to nearly nothing. People all over the world relied solely on eating a plant-based diets. Of course the switch wasn’t easy, scientists all over the world created plant based alternatives to things like meat and dairy. The United States government cut down on the budget towards national security and allocated that money towards things like infrastructure and healthcare. More jobs opened up and the economy began to grow. Things got worse before they got better. Countries all over the world took in climate refugees who had lost their homes due to sea level rising. The United States, among other developed nations, fed people who lost their sources of food until they could finally develop a stable system. Americans developed sympathy for others who were not in the same position as them. They wanted to help and they demanded the government do so. For the first time, the United States of America was stepping up as a leader in the climate crisis issue. 
                                     <br><br>

	It is the year 2060 now. It’s hard to remember the past sometimes. Sometimes I only remember the division, the  violence and the anger. It took months of protests, some not so peaceful, to finally get the government to act. Government completely changed and the whole system was reinvented. It still hurts to think about the millions of people we could’ve saved if we had just acted sooner. I chose not to have children and instead adopted. When I look at my child now, I know they’ll grow up in a better world than I did. When I’m gone, I can leave peacefully knowing I helped make the world a better place and gave the generations after me the opportunity to make it better. If I could say one thing to my past self and others, it’d be to not be afraid of change any longer. Change can be scary. But nothing will be as scary as where we’re heading if we choose not to act now.

A message from the future, 
                                     <br><br>


In 2020, you were pessimistic on the battle against the climate crisis. Well as it turns out, you were right to be so. It is now the year 2060 and not much has changed in terms of our actions to combat the climate crisis. Though, many people battled to make the necessary changes to protect our planet, they failed. There was just not enough support from the public to make the climate crisis one of the most important issues that the government should focus on. Time and time aga
                                     <br><br>

in, the people care more about themselves and their wealth over the well being of the planet and future generations.

                                     <br><br>

In 2020, Trump was re-elected and obviously nothing was done about the crisis since he believes it is all a hoax. This turnout was devastating for a lot of people and many gave up hope in trying to combat the crisis. If the people won’t come together and the government won’t take action on the issue at hand, then the battle is already lost.

                                     <br><br>

We have made very few changes such as more buildings and vehicles run on green energy, but that is not enough. People still fail to understand that technology will not solve the issue of the climate crisis. People refuse to make simple lifestyle changes like switching to a predominantly plant-based diet and using more public transportation. It is sad to see that we have not come together as a country to help save our future even after seeing the drastic effects that climate change has brought upon us. There has been an increase in wildfires and flooding along the coast of every nation. The government sees this as minor issues and fails to help everyone who was affected by these disasters caused by the climate crisis. 
                                     <br><br>


The battle seems to be over and we have lost. It is only a matter of time before everything collapses around us.

<p>

To the 19-year-old me, 


                                     <br><br>

No matter what you are planning to do, please do it without any hesitation. I cannot tell you anything about me, because of the Temporal paradox. However, I would like to share with you what the future looks like and what happened after your 20 years old birthday party. 

                                     <br><br>


Firstly, we did not reach 0% fossil fuel consumption by 2050 as the Green New Deal suggested. We switched to 100% green energy a few years later. Although we missed the deadline, the Green New Deal helped billions of people in developing countries to get what they actually deserve. Those developing countries are wealthy and clean right now. Thanks to the absence of those fracking companies.

                                     <br><br>


Secondly, I am now vegan. Not only because of the environmental concerns, but also due to the food shortage problem. To feed the 10 billion people on this planet, we wiped out 80% farmland and turned it into cropland. The production rate bumped 5 times than we had in 2020. Animal products, especially beef has become extremely expensive. When you get used to a vegan diet, meat becomes somewhat unpleasant and smells terrible.  

                                     <br><br>


Lastly, I want to thank you for all of the efforts you are making right now. I remember this is a special year for all of you. The coronavirus and U.S. politics are influencing the world greatly. Something extraordinary will happen in the next decade and your generation will become the leaders. The environment needs this generation to act up.

Dear Future Self,
                                      <br><br>

You’re probably wondering right now why you are looking at this letter and what it even says? In fact, you probably don’t even remember that you wrote this letter. You are probably perplexed that I knew that I know that you don’t know about this letter, which probably makes you wonder who in the hell is giving this letter to you. 
                                     <br><br>


Well, just as a surprise, IT’S ME! It is your future self from 2060 writing to you about how life is 40 years in the future. Yeah, by now you pretty much have your whole life solidified, but I am not here to actually talk about your life. I’m here to talk about what has happened to the planet in the past 40 years. I am sure that you wanted to hear a different letter from me that solely discusses what your (mine, our?) life is like, but trust me, to hear this story from me (or I guess technically you) is going to be a much better one. This is the story of the human race in the past 40 years. 
                                     <br><br>


Well, since 2020 not A TON has changed, but there is a good amount of change. People still fight over money and there is still a good amount of fossil fuel industries that exist. However, as I am typing this, we are currently more green than ever before. The United States adopted a more sustainable economy that supplies jobs for people who lost them due to the shutdown of a lot of fossil fuel industries and factory farms, and in fact, the economy is growing than ever before. At first, it might be difficult to believe this because it requires a huge shift in governmental perspective in order to even make something like this possible. However, Trump made much of America realize that we have to be united in creating change. In the past 40 years, we have had a government that cared more about unity than it did about partisanship. We had a country that was more united than ever, and because of it, we were able to identify root problems and help create a more unified governmental system. 
                                     <br><br>


Yeah, sure, there are still problems. Many issues that come to the stand are partisan-based, and a lot of the times, there is still argument in government. That’s how it works. However, I do not remember a time when our government acted more as a collective than it has during my time -- this time. And for that, I am very grateful. 
                                     <br><br>


However, what also happened in between your time and mine is the fact that our country started to actually care about foreign nations. We scratched our isolationist and protectionist approach and started to care more about the people of the rest of the world rather than just focusing on the people in our own country. Yes, we still prioritize our own citizens. However, it is not like before where we only spend less than 1% of our federal budget to foreign aid. We have taken a leadership role within the world, and we are backing that leadership with action. We have promoted and implemented sustainable forms of energy across the globe, lifted economies so they could rely less on fossil fuels, and helped create jobs in areas where coal mining or factory work are the only two sources of employment they can have. 
                                     <br><br>


I think the root of this is because we realized that our resources were going to waste. We just could not stand by and watch as the world suffered around us. 
                                     <br><br>


What we also did, especially abroad, is promote education and higher levels of it. We started to pay our teachers more (which took WAYY too long to implement, but let’s not talk about that). Students became more interested in learning. Our country became a better place because of it. Higher education led to more innovation within our nation, and it allowed us to develop newer technology that can help combat climate change. It allowed for a population rate to slow down in order to accomodate the now 9 billion people on this planet. Most of all, however, we have done a better job of understanding and managing waste (both food and items). 
                                     <br><br>


Because we have been able to do all of those things, we have been able to improve our climate. Granted, not all of the problems are solved. We still have not reversed what generations of climate harm has done to our planet. We still have not defeated the fossil fuel industry elites. We still haven't found a way to deter anyone who tries and uses fossil fuels more than they should. We still haven't found the best way to create societal changes that reduce carbon emissions. Yet, we are trying, and progress has been made.
                                     <br><br>


That’s all you can really ask for anyone -- that there is progress. Since 2020, we have made that progress. I am writing this to you now because I want you to know that it is still progressing, and we are still working. This work never ends, so as you live your life, remember to keep fighting for our planet. 


</p><hr>



<p>

It is the year 2060 and I am writing this letter to everyone from the future. All I can say is that we tried. We tried to stop the climate crisis and we tried to stop fossil fuels, the warming of our oceans, killing coral reefs, extinction of animals, and destruction of natural forests. But, I guess we didn’t try hard enough. I feel like my generation was able to learn a lot in our lifetime and was able to experience a lot of things that, perhaps, your generation couldn’t. To be honest, I didn’t even think that we would survive this long. We were able to buy ourselves an extra 10 years to our life, but we didn’t do quite enough to save us all. I began seeing how humans were destroying our Earth in 2020 when I took the Climate Crisis english class and, thus, my journey to join the fight against the climate crisis began. 
                                     <br><br>

We were constantly encouraged to change our lifestyles, like eating a plant based diet, start using public transportation, don’t buy fast fashion, and voting for candidates that want to stop global warming. But, this obviously was not enough. Everyone had, and still does, this mindset that money and stuff equate to happiness. But, coming from my generation I can tell you that it doesn’t and never will. Of course one might not have to worry about being homeless by having money but if you think about what actually makes you happy, it never comes out to be what you own. I once had the same mindset but I quickly realized that life is worth so much more than buying when I started to see how happy I was when I stopped shopping. I’m not sure if our society will ever realize that. Everyone always wanted to just have a life that was convenient for them, and we were told that there would be consequences and my generation tried to save the planet, but there was not enough of us. There were not enough people to help fight the climate crisis and go vote and that’s the reason why we only have a few years here left on earth to live. 
                                     <br><br>

I was able to grow up knowing what certain animals were, being able to see them in their natural habitat, and being able to just go in the ocean without the acidity burning me. I remember what it was like to live a normal life. However, I was also able to see the beautiful planet that I grew up on, quickly die and see animals go extinct that your generation won’t ever get to experience. There’s still time to fix this. If you guys want to survive past the age of 20 you must come together as a whole, with one common goal in mind: stop the climate crisis. I hope I’m able to see if you guys are able to do it, you have my generation to support you and I believe that we still have time. If you want to survive into your adult years you must act now!

<p>

2020 was the year I began to take the climate crisis more seriously than I ever had previously. Sure, before I knew that the climate wasn't handling our rate of consumption well but just figured that somehow our country would do something about it because my individual choices wouldn't make much of a difference. However, taking English 23 showed me that it is my individual actions that would accelerate the fight against the climate crisis on a larger scale. Due to our country's attitude toward climate change as well as how deeply mass consumerism is rooted in our society, I was rather pessimistic that we would be able to solve this issue in a timely manner. Given our political climate, it didn't seem that changes would be made in time because capitalism continues to be the driving force for our "survival" and doesn't show any signs of slowing down (actually, speeding up is in its nature).
                                     <br><br>


2040 was when things around the world really started to become apparent. I have been vegan (mostly) for about 17 years now, as it was a difficult change to completely rid my diet of meat. Miami experiences year-round flooding, up to 2 miles inland in comparison to the sea levels 20 years, which has caused many people to migrate north. Not only have sea levels risen dramatically since taking English 23 and understanding the dangers of it, but the coral reefs are also now a species of the past. This has proven to be detrimental for the seafood industry as prices have become largely inflated and is something only the richest of the rich can afford. How the consumption of fish has not become largely illegal due to decades of overfishing and the bleaching of coral reefs is beyond me. Large measures like the Green New Deal have been implemented (finally), however, it seems to be too late to reverse the damage that has been done in the past 20 years. California's desert has expanded dramatically due to shifted weather patterns resulting in a lack of rainfall. Year-round, destructive wildfires are normal events that still continue to get worse and worse. 

                                     <br><br>

2060, finally, is when the effects of the climate crisis have finally shown to slow down. The rise in global temperature has been slowing for around 10 years now, although still increasing. Even though almost all the ice caps have melted at this point, they have now begun to halt and their mass remains the same. We somehow were able to pull it off before the North Pole and Antarctica became non-existent. This can all be attributed to the adoption of the carbon tax in 2044, where companies were charged an exponentially increasing carbon tax that would threaten their business should they not make dramatic changes. This carbon tax is thanks to President AOC, perhaps one of the few people humanity can attribute the continued survival of the human race to. If I'm being honest, as much as I wanted her to be president I was unsure of whether it would ever happen given our country's ideology. But I think it took direct impacts on our country and its citizens in the form of sea-level rise and crazy wildfires for people to finally wake up and realize that there is a major problem that AOC has had a plan for a long time now. I can finally have faith in the future of our planet and know that my children's children can have a place to live, not endure, for many years to come.



</p><hr>



<p>

The climate crisis was the first biggest issue my generation really had to deal with on a global scale. I remember turning twenty-one years old and being scared about what the world would look like in sixty years. The ice caps were melting, entire continents burning, and natural disasters unlike anything seen before. I knew that there was only so much I could do on my own, but that didn’t stop me from trying my best. That was around the time I switched to a vegan diet, limited my use of cars and planes, and for the very first time started actually thinking about the carbon I put into the atmosphere with every act I made. I noticed others around me taking an interest too, trying to alter their lives in meaningful ways to try and combat this growing crisis. 
                                     <br><br>

There were rallies, sure. Protests and marches and gatherings of all kinds to try and ensure a future for the ones who would come after us. Hundreds and thousands of people campaigning and warning the public about the terrifying reality of the time we were living in, trying desperately to draw attention to the anomalies in nature that signaled our self-made demise was closer than we ever thought it would be. We even made it into office, with people like Alexia Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, who saw a connection between poverty and the destruction of our planet. People were inspired to stand up and fight for a better future for everyone. 
                                     <br><br>

Yet it still wasn’t enough. No matter how many people dedicated their days to a greener future, the planet suffered the most at the hands of those who wished to exploit it for their own gain, favoring wealth and influence over whatever disaster awaited them when the growing heat and destruction of habitats caught up to them. The wealthiest of the wealthy, the elites hoarding their insurmountable fortune from the rest of society like medieval dragons, too obsessed with their treasure to notice the destruction of their flames. 
                                     <br><br>

The people really responsible for the heat death of our planet were the people with the most that chose to do nothing. People like Donald Trump, Kanye West, and every other person in a position of wealth and influence who chose to do nothing in the face of a global crisis. Big oil and other profit hungry corporations, industrialization, and ignorance are what started it, but the complacency and apathy of those with the power to fund and advocate for large scale change. The resources and social sway of the rich were the only plausible solution to a problem that thrived from public misinformation and inefficient modes of energy. We needed to put funding towards finding a carbon-friendly source of fuel to lower fossil fuel emissions, as well as electing officials to spread accurate information to the masses to draw attention to this disaster that threatened our very existence. 
                                     <br><br>

It wasn’t until many years later that we actually began implementing these into our infrastructure, when the fires and natural disasters began to impact those wealthy elitists who never would have thought in a million years that climate change would impact their lives. The generation before mine didn’t see an issue with the old way of life either, and it nearly cost us all that chance to witness one the most prosperous ages in human history: an eco-friendly planet, dedicated to the protection and happiness of every living thing. There was a time in my life I was afraid I may never live to say those words, much less to my own grandchildren. I hope that this letter will encourage you to do your best to help our planet prosper long after I’m gone, for it will surely continue to spin long after each of us has taken our time wandering this uniquely beautiful earth we call home.  
                                     <br><br>


With all the health and happiness I can give,

                                     <br><br>

We did not make the changes that we needed to in time. Remember your house in Long Beach, CA? Yeah, so that's underwater now. Everything from your childhood is either partially or totally underwater, and all of it has no economic worth. Miami is a diving tourist destination, and you can fish in the Miami Dolphins Stadium now. President (Insert old white name here) just said that the floods were "God punishing us" and still doesn't believe in Climate Change, even though 99.99% of the scientific community has to come to a consensus. Life looks pretty bleak.

                                     <br><br>

We've known about anthropogenic climate change for almost a century now, but greedy politicians accepted billions from big oil, leading to more and more greenhouse gases every year. Scientists tried tirelessly to come up with real technological advances, even inventing real, affordable carbon-capturing devices, but it was too little, too late.

                                     <br><br>

Some cultural changes took off and made small, meaningful improvements. Celebrities took up a "go thrift" campaign resulting in much less wasted clothing, and Zara and Forever 21 closed down. The CEO of Zara, once one of the richest men alive, died in an unprecedented forest fire caused by climate change. Veganism and Climatarianism took off, with 70% of Americans swearing off of red meats, and 40% swearing off of all meats. Methane emissions went way way down, but the money-backed fracking industry still produced exponentially more methane than we could stop. Biking took off in liberal, more accessible cities like San Francisco, Portland, San Diego, Santa Monica, and the public transportation investments in LA paid off greatly, with people using cars as personal work transportation 50% less. Minimalism never took off to the same degree; people still find a lot of drive in material things and pursuing bullshit measures of capital success. Don't forget the progress that everyday people made, even when big money and greed kept those changes from compounding. 

                                     <br><br>

Climate Change has disproportionately burdened those in developing countries. East Africa has been burdened with a huge influx of Locusts, insects that have killed off up to 3/4 of their crops. India has sadly run out of resources and with the US and Western Europe proving that they could not make the changes and be the catalyst for change that the world could follow, starvation and crime run rampant, with small farmers taking the biggest hits. The world is on the brink of economic collapse, and all the money that big oil gave our politicians isn't even worth the paper it's printed on. The great coral reefs are no more, many tears shed for the loss of Natural Parks, and Earth's biodiversity and beauty will never return to the level at which it once was. 

                                     <br><br>

I hope this is not your future, but it's not hope that we need. It's a movement. Do what must be done so that your children can see where you grew up by walking, not by snorkeling.

I am proud of you.
                                     <br><br>

I hope by the time you are reading this, you are doing the things you loved, you are proud of your accomplishments and your impact in the world, you are probably living happily by the mountains enjoying your tea and cookies with your loving wife and kids. I hope that you and your family are enjoying the fascinating view of nature and appreciating it to the fullest.  With Ken's teachings, I hope that you changed your attitude of how to interact with the world around and how to take care of your environment. With this in mind, I hope the issue about the climate crisis has been solved, people have finally realized and put into action what (me and you) studied and envisioned in English 23. I am really hoping that you’re living in a world in which there is a new environment deal imposed that didn’t actually provide a solution but also has called and has done the action. In addition, I hope you are still a minimalist at this point, I know (me and you) had dreams before in buying all the things you want, and remember, when we were judged by other people of being ‘cheap’ by the way we purchase our needs and wants at the same time when we were broke? I hope you are successful enough to not be considered ‘broke’ and I hope you are still continuing your minimalist point of view. In fact, I hope that everyone living in your time by now has adapted the idea of minimalism and finally realized that greed and gluttony when it comes to consumerism will not provide you with happiness or any humanistic value because we are never satisfied. 
                                     <br><br>

In terms of body-building, I really still hope (in the bottom of my heart) that you are still working out, getting those ‘gains’ like usual, and of course your cherry picking ability of picking the ‘right food’. Knowing you, I know it was definitely hard to abandon eating meat as you always loved meat, you are a carnivore from when (me and you) was still a kid. However, I hope that you finally realized of going vegan or perhaps, still in the process of it? It definitely is a hard task to completely switch to veganism but, you are also helping the environment, remember when we saw Cowspiracy? It was crazy enough to see how eating beef is drastically contributing to the carbon emission of humans, I hope you stick with your values and discipline to transition on being vegan, because the effects of eating plant-based diet is worth it to your body in terms of being healthy and in fact, I am pretty confident that you have become even more shredded and even more muscular of being a vegan. Additionally, I hope that you have also shared your knowledge and also influenced people by eating plant-based diets. 
                                     <br><br>

Lastly, I am really hoping that by the time you are reading this,  companies pursue their climate goals for reaching  and finally limiting their production supply in making more and more profit. I hope that politicians don’t give more empty promises. I wish that your leaders by now are a lot better and a lot more knowledgeable of what the climate crisis was all about, I hope they were able to pass legislations that eventually resulted in the ‘real actions’ that our society needs and have finally stop doubting the existence of the climate crisis. I hope both the government and the market-industry did something to deal with climate problems instead of fighting for their quota.

I am writing to you in the year 2020. Right now, humanity is facing many challenges: climate change, the coronavirus, and President Trump might be staying for another 4 years in the white house. (I am kidding about the last one. I do not know what he does, so I do not have the right to judge him). We are literally digging our own graves. I used to think ordinary people like us cannot do anything against the wealthy people and powerful politicians. But things are changing so greatly that we can stand up to fight all the injustices in this world. 
                                     <br><br>

The environmental movement is of no difference from the Civil Rights and the Feminists movement. We are fighting for the greater good, for humanity as a whole. We often feel ourselves to be entitled like a holy religious saint. But that extremely strong faith of believing and trusting what we are doing today is not even “obsessive” enough to solve the issue. For many years, we tried to find the ultimate solution to the puzzle of global warming. We executed many laws, regulations, and restrictions which enrage the fossil fuel interests. The situation, however, is not getting better because of our increasing population and the increasing use of natural resources.
                                     <br><br>

Although we were aware of this issue, we failed to make a change because of our dreams of living in better material life. However, this desire has become some sort of greed which drives us to consume natural resources restlessly as if tomorrow will be the apocalypse of the human race. People living in developed countries are using far more what they actually need to live. Here I am not saying people should just use the exact amount of what they need. It is ok to enjoy your life, buying fashionable gadgets, having steak dinners, and driving a couple of hundreds of miles on a road trip. We have the freedom to do whatever we want and spend our money. The problem is, however, we are spoiling ourselves too much. We are not consuming 2 times what we need. We are not buying 3 times what we need. The statistics show we can feed about 50 people in a developing world with consumption from a single individual in a developed world. I believe that we are facing self-destruction if we do not slow down on exploiting resources. 
                                     <br><br>

We have about 7.8 billion people living in 2020. The number is still increasing as our standard of living keeps improving. However, I am afraid we are going to run out of fossil fuels in the next 20 or 30 years, if we do not turn the earth into a microwave and get all people popcorned before that. Therefore, I am seeking for other renewable energy resources such as solar and wind energy to keep the future society functioning. Again, I do not feel entitled to say these because I am not a charity person. I want my child to eat steak dinner, to drive around appreciating the amazingness of nature, and to buy a lot of stuff as I am doing right now. That sounds super selfish, but that is what I am thinking inside, honestly. 
                                     <br><br>

Instead of living like a climatarian and reducing my consumption, I would love to seek other solutions like a technological improvement because I am a geek. As for what I can do as a physicist, there are many options. 1. Try to find an ultimate solution. I can dive into theoretical physics and try to understand energy better. This universe consists of around 68% dark energy 27% dark matter. If I conduct research on these things and find something, the result might provide us with another energy source. 2. Try to slow down the global warming process. I can start to research on more practical field such as engineering and designing more efficient engines. These things will make direct impact on global warming, but they will not completely solve the problem.
                                     <br><br>

Global warming is terrible, but it is our “north wind”. This civilization will evolve into the next level where people no longer need to rely on fossil fuels. With that being said, there must be other intelligent beings other than humans. Maybe they had the similar problem as we are having right now and overcame it. Well maybe you already met them in the future, but I have no way of knowing that. Here I will try to join the people who are pushing the border of science and hopefully we will find new energy sources. 
                                     <br><br>

If you guys have time machines in 2060, come by and say hi. I will not tell anyone so that our meeting will not violate whatever laws in physics/science or laws in your world.

</p><hr>



<p>
As I am writing this, I am quite pessimistic about the future of the world. I wish I weren’t, but considering that we need to act quickly to solve the climate crisis, and yet most individuals are not concerned about it enough to take action, I am hesitant to feel otherwise. That being said, I really hope that, in 2020, the government will have a shift in leadership so that climate policies, initiated by the ideas in the Green New Deal, will become a reality. I hope that this country will start to rely more on renewable energy than coal, and depend less on oil. I hope that we will rejoin the Paris Agreement, and be able to reach the target. I hope that society will take this issue more seriously, as something to be resolved regardless of factors like politics or economics. I hope that the culture will change to become more environmentally conscious and active, through both personal and collective means. I hope that other fossil fuel dependent countries will also make changes to help curb the effects that they have, in part, brought about. I do not know how long these things will take, but, ideally, they are all things that will happen within this decade, which has barely started. I hope that the person reading this will be in a world in which climate change has not made a significant impact on his or her, nor any other beings’ lives, in the way that predictions fear now. I hope that, at that point, the environment will not be getting worse. At last, I hope that people will have acted to help treat the planet and all the living things on it well, far longer than another forty years later.

2060. As you're wondering (future self), what is the world like now? Well, let me tell you, it is never what I would have expected. In 2020 after the very, very close democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders got the lead. In November we (yes 75% of the country) voted for Sanders in the presidential election. After the pandemic in March it truly showed us how easily we can change our lifestyles. We decreased out flights and travel in general. People stopped wasting tons of food, and we stopped purchasing from brands that are from overseas. On top of all of this, Bernie launched the Green New Deal into action. Immediately we cut down on fossil fuels. Right away we saw a change for the better. Our rainforests started coming back, indigenous tribes were saved from the oil companies, and the sky got a little bit clearer. And yes you may be thinking “what about the fossil fuel workers!!!!!” Do not worry, they were redirected to the new jobs being made from the green new deal. We then joined back into the Paris Agreement and stayed below the 2 degrees celsius. If we did not it would have been extremely hard for humans to be here today. There would have been migrations that I personally believe would have started WW3 and we almost lost the coral reefs. Sadly, Australia burned all the way through, with California coming close. The next step took a few more years- cutting down on single use plastics (this is where the Boomers show their true light). After complaining about having to bring in reusable cups to Starbucks and needing to bring their own bags to the grocery stores, look where we are now. We all carry silicon straws and reusable cups (which also makes everyone more individual and unique!). Then when we realized how many jobs there can actually be in the U.S we stopped buying from sweatshops. So instead of spending so much money on a Fendi bag or Balenciaga shoes, we are able to always be on the lookout for something with better patterns and a less basic look. I can not wait for you to get to this year, it is what you have been working for. Keep up on your plant based diet because that is all we have to eat these days. We made a pact with King Julian (from Madagascar) that they are not our food, but out peers. The future is amazing and it is waiting for you. Stay strong through all of this, I know it is scary, but we saved what we thought was impossible.

To my future children,                                      <br><br>

As of right now, in 2020, the idea of a climate crisis has been debated for over many decades. As it continues to become a more prominent issue, I am hoping that we are able to make the necessary changes. As one of my college professors told me during my first year of college, “I am sorry for what my generation has done.” I will do my best to be as sustainable as possible, I will be vegan by the time I have you and your siblings(if you have any) and is the reason you are vegan. As a country, we have the necessary technology to get rid of the oil industry and start on a new path. Now, we wait and hope that democrats take their place in the senate and begin the movement. As they push the Green New Deal, we will successfully take a huge step in the right direction to make this world a better place for you and your own children. I was not planning on having children due to financial and environmental reasons, but now I do my best to raise you to be an activist and not stand around waiting for others to make the first move. As my generation realizes the overall impact of the climate crisis, we will begin making changes and vote for the right people. We will have built an economy on the idea of sustainable energy and transportations. 
                                     <br><br>

I write to you to ask you to continue pushing to make the world a better place. If you choose to have children, do not raise them with the mentality that more is better. This is one reason the generations before mine harmed our only home. If living on Mars is an option, please don’t. Plant mini-gardens in your windowsill and ride your bike to the closest market. Live a happy life and be content with what you have. As an 18 year old, I thought having the nicest car or the most recent technology would make me happy, yet here I am worried about the future of the next generations. The changes in my life were not made for myself, but for you and your peers around you. I chose to break apart from the “American Dream,” and make the changes that I know are necessary. My generation will stand up and push for change. There will be more activism in my own generation than there is in any other.
                                     <br><br>

I want you to run for all the political offices that you can. Female, male, or whatever you identify by, you will have a fair chance to make a difference. With my generation as your elders, we will stand beside you in this fight. It will not be divided between you and ‘boomers’ anymore. This is humanity’s fight against the past decisions and political figures. As the oil industries become shut down, we will rebuild on top with sustainable ways of living. Not as hippies, but in a modern, technological way. We are not moving backward in time by moving away from natural gas and oil, we are advancing. 
                                     <br><br>

My final message to you is to keep your ground. There will be many people who will go against your views. Look in the past at my generation who took a stand and continued to push until we got the changes that you have in your time. Start small if it doesn’t seem viable at first. As others join you, push yourself harder and make more change. Be the change you are wanting to see and lead by example.

Dear self, 
                                     <br><br>

It is now the year 2060, 

                                      <br><br>


Reflecting back, so much has changed since when I first became educated about our climate crisis and how our individual actions greatly impact our environment. In 2020 (the time I am writing this letter), I began taking a class called Climate Crisis 101 with Professor Ken Hiltner. Before taking this class, I knew about climate change, only from what I had learned from previously taking a different class from this same professor. I learned that eating meat almost everyday, traveling via car everyday, and buying clothes every so often, greatly contributed to my individual carbon footprint. I don’t know how I was so clueless about my actions, not thinking about how such small actions can greatly impact our environment. After taking this course, there’s so much I have learned that I still apply to my life today. I made the conscious decision to make a change in my lifestyle and influence others to do the same. I travel via public transportation because it has become our norm. It is amazing how we were able to change our ways. I now shop at thrift shops or buy from companies that invest back into the environment. 

 
                                     <br><br>

The year of 2020, was a lesson for me in general as a victim of capitalism. It was so crucial for me to self reflect on my actions as an individual knowing what I know now about our climate crisis. 2020, in general was a year that captured the attention of everyone. From the outbreak of COVID-19, affecting everyone globally, it was crucial as to how we attacked the issue that is our climate crisis. Taking preventative measures to stop the melting of the permanent frost so that thousands of year old viruses and disease won’t impact us the way the coronavirus has.  Today, the carbon tax exists, people use public transportation, city living/co-housing is a norm, growing our own foods to prevent food waste, etc. All the alternatives Ken has stated that allowed us to imagine a world without fossil fuel are now our realities. Although it took time, it was so crucial for us to make the transition as fast as possible to preserve and save what was left of our world.

 This is you from the future. From 2060. I am writing to you to inform you of all of the things that have transpired in the last 40 years (the next 40 years for you). After taking a class at UCSB called “English 23” with Ken, your eyes finally open about the climate crisis. You realize that you can no longer live unsustainably, as it did not sit right in your stomach to learn about all of the horrors that is happening to Earth and to continue living the way that you have been for the past 20 years. The first thing that you decided to do was to swear off flying. Your whole life only consisted of 3 plane flights. You have always thought that this number was relatively low, so you did not consider yourself a part of the group of people who were destroying the planet due to the horrors of flying. However, after taking this climate change class, you finally realize how much damage you have done to the planet with just these three flights. In addition to flying, you finally understood the damage that owning and driving a car does to the planet. For the next 3 years, you stop driving altogether. You bike and take public transportation everywhere you go. Unfortunately, this does not last long. With the long bus and bike rides to work, you begin driving again. However, you did make a drastic change in terms of your diet and eating habits. For starters, you stop eating and buying food in excess. You limit your food intake to what you need and only what you need. You begin your dietary change by becoming a pescatarian. Although you tried becoming a vegetarian and a vegan multiple times, it never stuck. Although this disappointed you, you realized that you still have made a big change, a change that would not have happened if you did not take this class. This made you understand the impact that someone could have on your life. Because of this, your passion for climate change rubbed off on the rest of your family and your friends. This showed you that “one person can truly make a difference.” I am writing to tell you that I am proud of you and what you will become one day. Never lose hope.

Dear me in 2020, 
                                     <br><br>

This is a letter from 2060, 40 years later than you took the English23: Climate crisis. In 2020, I know that you have started to change your daily habits. Starting from stopping buying fast fashioned clothing, eating large portions of veggies instead of meat, and using public transportation more frequently than taking the car and etc.. However, the climate crisis was not ceasing but even grew more seriously, as not everyone in the earth was doing the same thing that's good for the earth. Many of them still remain the same habit. The fossil company was still taking power over the government, increasing the carbon emissions. There was still a lot of waste by people, especially by developed countries like America. People still didn’t take the climate crisis seriously as they held a pessimistic view thinking it’s too hard to change. 
                                     <br><br>

This year, people finally realized the seriousness of the climate crisis, as so many catastrophic events happened all around the world. Huger hurricanes, fires and others caused death and other economic loss. the government finally takes the Green Deal in progress. However, now it takes more than trillions to recover from the disasters and reform the countries’ environmental system. it’s much cheaper to take actions back in your days. If time can flash back, please do more to influence the surroundings to change, so that all these tragedies do not happen now.



</p><hr>



<p>
I have decided to address this letter to people who want to get more active in the fight against climate change.

                                     <br><br>

Forty years ago, I was 20 years old, a sophomore at the University of California Santa Barbara. I found myself sitting in a Climate Change class discussing the ways that we can save the planet, one personal action at a time. I was excited, hopeful, and determined. This is it I thought, this is how we save not only ourselves but all the life on Earth. 
                                     <br><br>


It was a huge struggle. Coming from a culture where meat was such a common thing made it difficult to transition out of it. My family thought I was crazy and was not accommodating to my needs. However, I persisted because I knew that what I was doing was bigger than myself. My family over time got used to the idea of not consuming meat. They started to use meat alternatives and now today rarely consume it. It was a huge culture change for all of us but seeing the reality of the situation is what made them turn around. It’s sad that it took physical changes like coastal cities going underwater from them to start taking things seriously but change began.
                                     <br><br>


The next challenge I tackled was my mode of transportation. Throughout college, my favorite way of getting around was biking. The college I went to was very accessibe towards bikes and it was a great way to get exercise in. To get to places further away I would use the bus. However, this all changed when I graduated and got a job. The roads to my job were not bike friendly and it made it easy for me to buy a car. Two years go by and I didn’t really think about the consequences of owning and using the car until I logged back onto my old youtube account. I was seeing all the comments I made when I was in college and stopped to analyze just how big my carbon footprint had gotten. I got to work and found places where I could easily lower my carbon footprint and decided that getting rid of my car was a must and I never looked back.
                                     <br><br>


Another challenge I took on was condensing what I had. I noticed that over the years I  had accumulated a lot of belongings and my life was feeling cramped and overwhelmed. I got rid of the things I did not need and thrifted when I did need things. It was a great way to save money and give items a second chance to be used. It was hard to stop myself from buying new things but what's the point of buying new things when there are perfectly usable options? However, I did not limit myself to no longer buying new things. Sometimes when something broke and I had not bought myself anything new recently, I would treat myself and buy it new. Balance is key, we don’t have to go from one extreme to the other.
                                     <br><br>


The point I am trying to make here is that it's simple actions like this that can save our planet. They don’t cost us anything except minor inconveniences. But I wouldn’t go as far as calling them that because it is those actions that are saving the lives of millions. Yes, using public transportation sucks and takes forever but think about the places you wouldn't regularly see, the people you’ll meet. These changes aren’t solely for the benefit of the planet and the life on it but for you as an individual as well. 

                                     <br><br>

Sometimes we are leading lives where we aren't happy. We try to find happiness in materialistic items like the latest phone or latest clothing but of course it does not bring us happiness. It is the connections we make with each other when exchanging items, or protesting for something that brings us close. The last piece of advice I leave you guys with is to vote. Vote like everything depends on it because it does. My generation failed to pass a lot of good radical changes because they thought voting doesn't work or count as activism. But they were wrong and we wasted a lot of precious time. The generation after mine showed us just how valuable ones vote can be and we have them to thank for showing up and voting and making all these radical changes that are saving millions of lives. Use your vote to speak for those who can’t!

Dear Future Self,

Currently the year is 2020. Here is everything that is going wrong:
                                     <br><br>
Donald Trump is still president. The 2020 elections are close, and Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are Democratic frontrunners. It looks like Biden might win the nomination... Greenhouse gas levels in our atmosphere are continuously rising, with no slowing in sight. Natural disasters are raging across the globe. Not enough people are aware of the realness of the climate crisis. They have not realized that the effects are already here; we are already seeing them. 
                                     <br><br>

However, it is only the start of 2020. I have faith that things can change. I know this because of classes like this one. Because the over 800 students in this class are passionate about making a difference for our world. Because professors like Ken are out here educating people on climate. Because of this, I have that faith. I think that Bernie can pull through, and make his way into the Presidential position. From there, I hope the public's eyes will become more open to the truth of the climate change as well as more aware of the truths behind fossil fuel companies. This will aid in getting policies enacted which benefit our climate. This leads to what we, as students of this class, need to do in order to make sure this is the political outcome we get. We need to educate, educate, educate. Ken has provided us with the knowledge, and it is our job to disperse it.Whether it be  as simple as sharing the link to Ken's video discussing 20 ways you can better climate, or something like teaching your family members about the climate crisis, each word counts.  
                                     <br><br>

We have the power to direct which way our 2020 goes. (minus everything going on with the corona virus...) With the knowledge we have gained froths class we have a chance to make a difference for our future, and I truly hope we take this chance.
                                     <br><br>

So, future me, did we?

A Letter to My Future Self
                                     <br><br>

In 2020, as the fight against climate change and misinformation campaigns accelerates, I begin actively changing my habits that contributed to this problem and advocating for more sustainable lifestyles. In 2020, I voted for Bernie Sanders and Joan Hartmann, both of whom support the Green New Deal and are brave enough to face off against fossil fuel corporations. I cut beef out of my diet and have switched to locally and ethically raised poultry, eventually aiming to transition to a full vegetarian diet. I’ve made a vow to stop buying clothes and products from unethical and unsustainable fast fashion corporations, instead choosing to buy second-hand and recycle old clothing.
                                     <br><br>

In 2025, I envision myself as having gone entirely vegetarian. In this ideal reality, I will live in a city - such as Portland, which is leaps and bounds ahead of the country in environmental sustainability and green initiatives - and I will bike to work, just as I have biked everywhere during my college days in Santa Barbara. If I must own a car, it is a used electric vehicle that I only drive when absolutely necessary. Hopefully, our government has accepted their responsibility in downplaying the climate crisis by this time, and they have re-entered the Paris Agreement and implemented Green New Deal initiatives. I hope to see a wave of progressive leaders instated into our local, regional, and national offices. Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic primaries and subsequently the national election. In 2024, he was re-elected and continues leading us strongly into the future.
                                     <br><br>

In 2040, we have finally built a sustainable high-speed railway system in California, and are working on finishing a national one. Our nationwide infrastructure is energy-efficient. Less and less people are driving to work everyday, instead opting for the bus or metro systems; those who do choose to drive are buying used cars at a higher rate than ever and are choosing electric vehicles far more than gas-powered vehicles.  Solar-powered energy is now the leading source of energy, greater than gas and oil and other polluting fuels. It is now considered illegal to accept bribes from fossil fuel lobbyist organizations, and our government is full of officials who represent the people and advocate for a better future - a far cry from the corrupt politicians and selfish, greedy Republican Party of 2020. We have made positive changes to our lifestyles and are transitioning away from a materialistic, consumerist society. We are working together with other countries to save and restore our rainforests and coral reefs. Our global carbon emissions are decreasing year by year. Though the fight against climate change is far from over, we are finally creating a better world for future generations.

It is 2060, and I am gone. I made it through 2020 without losing anyone. I lost my brother in the 2025 NARS outbreak, and my mom soon after. The travel restrictions during that period murdered the airline industry, and no amount of government support could keep them alive, and that meant my dad was never coming back from overseas.
I went to my deathbed not knowing why my dad stopped responding around 2027. Then again, during the Collapse it was hard to know much of anything.
I survived the first great waves of the Collapse, when pandemics and climate change and hatred and all the sins of history piled up and chipped away America piece by piece. First, the federal government began shutting down its organizations one by one – Social Security fell soon, and in the wave of hatred and confusion and fuck-you-got-mine the states began rearming themselves, while army units began reporting to their own states instead of the chain of command. Nuclear codes were lost somewhere in there, which came terrifyingly close to ending the whole world no less than seven times.
Of course, by 2035, the federal government’s complete collapse in legitimacy and dissolution marked the beginning of the end. Some states regrouped together, but too little, too late. Climate change, though the human portion of it had been abruptly stopped by the pandemics and associated recessions ravaging the 2020s, had continued unabated by the fact that the climate had started to heat up of its own accord. The New California Republic had one of the best chances to begin putting back the pieces – but in a forgotten corner of the state, a group of secessionists within the state itself started a fire, which exploded across the state and the provisional capital. By the time the fires died down, one hundred and twenty-two days later, the state was in no shape to recover.
But I survived that collapse too.
I survived on the sheer strength of my cowardice, my desire to save the world without acting in a way that risked anything for me personally, not even my pride.
And then the building I was crashing in collapsed because it had been abandoned for fifteen years, and structural defects and time had finally caught up to it. By 2060, all that remains is a pile of overgrown rubble.
                                     <br><br>

It is the year 2060, and I thank my supporters for a hard-fought campaign. Truthfully speaking, I admit to myself, I probably shouldn’t have been running – I knew on an intellectual level that Maria would have been a better standard-bearer for the Progressive party, but the part of me that had advocated for my own beliefs insisted that I give it a shot.
My supporters are disappointed, some shocked – we’ve barely even gone through a quarter of the race, they say. In truth, what I tell myself is that it was a test – one that Maria passed with flying colors. I wanted to test how well her campaign would do against the politician that had made the Midwest one of the great leading states in America.
That had been a highlight, I told my supporters. The great pandemics and economic depressions of the 2020s had hit us hard, and the governments which we had been elected to in the 2030s were on the brink of annihilation. It was an honor to be elected mayor, to support mayors and senators and union leaders across the state who believed in our cause. 
Our cause was to make us the leaders of America – the true America, the dream of a better tomorrow in the darkest of hours. Though the great waves of pandemics and a world economy in free-fall sent us to the brink time and again, our coalition held strong, and began stepping forward. As the climate continued to worsen even in the great fall of human efforts, we began the great project of resisting the entire world. When the breadbaskets of the region threatened to desertify, we implemented silviculture in order to anchor the farms to the land. When our cities began to fill from refugees fleeing the devastated coasts, we did not refuse to welcome them as our own, as we rebuilt our cities to be both more interconnected and resilient, for when disaster struck we made sure to act early and decisively to staunch the bleeding. 
We were derided for being weak-hearted, for being inefficient, for helping others when we had so little ourselves. We were threatened by those who feared losing everything. Many had to leave the project for their own reasons – the loss of family members, the loss of their security, and frighteningly, the loss of their own beliefs.
But though the universe which we were born into had begun injust and bent towards the greatest calamity for all of human history, we fought. We fought to protect what we cared about, and the future of everything we loved. We fought against the universe to bend its moral arc. 
And by the skin of our teeth, we succeeded. Although the 2040s found us a lesser species than the 2020s, our movement had forged itself into an unstoppable march towards a brighter future. No longer was our region producing carbon dioxide – in fact, as the polar ice caps melted away and the methane locked in the Siberian permafrost escaped into the atmosphere, we were building hurricane-resistant bogs in Atlanta, Georgia and reclaiming New York City block by block. 
By the 2050s, although our atmosphere had spiked up to 2.5 degrees Celsius, we had managed to achieve a miracle: for the first time since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, our climate cooled for three years straight.
We had done so with the help of millions and billions of people, the collective will of humanity shaking off its doubts to do what was necessary.
And by the end of it, I had achieved much – but it was about time for me to retire.
So I did. I would entrust the future to a generation that had not made my mistakes, that possessed greater moral bravery, and the determination to see it through.
That’s what I told my supporters on that stage in 2060.
And I thanked them one last time, for helping a madman see his dream through. It didn’t feel like enough, but that was all I had left in me.

needed. Secondly, renewable energy is the new norm. In 2035, all houses were required to have solar panels installed. The government prioritized this movement and helped fund those who could not afford solar panels. Life will never be easy, but at least significant changes have been implemented. Culture has changed and is still changing! I love to see it. Less people drive cars. Public transportation is clean, safe, and cool. Vegans are the majority, and bringing reusable containers to restaurants is encouraged and accepted. I’d like you to know that these changes are not happening just in California but worldwide. More needs to be done, but at least the wheels are in motion. 
                                     <br><br>

2020 was a crazy year. Kobe passed away. We experienced the pandemic of Coronavirus. Classes are now online. Everything seems to be going wrong. Take all of this into consideration. People will finally wake up and realize that climate change is real. 2020 felt like the beginning of the end, but I urge you to have faith in humanity. 
                                     <br><br>

It’s important to keep in mind what the AOC said in her message from the future: “We can be whatever we have the courage to see.” It’s important to continue with the mindset that anything is possible. That’s the only way we’ll keep surviving. Global sustainability is achievable, so don’t give up! 
                                     <br><br>

You’re about to graduate from college. Everything seems crazy, but I assure you that everything will be alright. Trump will soon be a symbol of the past. Our generation does a great part in saving us, but we must keep striving for a better world. Without a doubt a lot could’ve been prevented if politicians in charge took precautions against climate change sooner, but thankfully we were able to pull through. You used to eat meat and drive everywhere. 2020 is the year you finally start to wake up and become more environmentally conscious. I can’t live without lentils now. 
                                     <br><br>

My final note to you is to remember that lead through action and stay kind to everyone. I promise that you will find peace by living simply.

To my past self,                                     <br><br>

The year is now 2060, oh how the world has changed since the college days. You have been hearing about global warming since your first days in elementary school, and at first your thought recycling scratch paper and empty bottles was saving the Earth. It was not until 2020, that you faithfully decided to choose that climate crisis class to fill a GE, that you realized how serious and imminent this issue actually was. You also realized that our country was turning a blind eye to this issue and it could lead to the end of mankind and the earth itself.  This struck panic in you and many of your fellow classmates. One of the biggest worries was if humanity could actually make the change to save the Earth? Will the world perish, and would it all fall into chaos? I am here from the future to tell you that it all turns out alright and that our generation managed to turn it all around. The generation raised in the earth that was solely problematic and crying for help, due to the carelessness of the generation above us. This climate crisis class started off as hopeless but through the ten weeks, you learned how you could spark a change, and that is exactly what you did. 
                                     <br><br>
2020 was the year that you first voted, it was a memorable moment, as you had just pulled an all nighter for your biochemistry class but still managed to drag yourself to the polling station right after the exam. You voted for Bernie and prayed that he would take the office. However, sadly, he did not win. Joe Biden took the presidency instead, I guess people wanted democrats back in office but were not ready for that much change yet. Nonetheless, democrats take over the white house once again! And the Green New Deal is put into movement! At the time, this was huge news, some cheered and others rioted. The climate deniers were saying that it was taking away their rights and it was all a sham, just a waste of money. But after a few years the government made it an effort to correctly inform people about the climate crisis and greenhouse gas emissions. This made the most difference because having everyone on the same page was crucial. They taught the newest generations in elementary to high school about how to sustain a healthy planet and all the consequences of carbon in our atmosphere and cleared up all the myths and falsehoods.
                                     <br><br>
The next step after informing the public was actually making the changes: this included converting large industries from fossil fuel power to renewable power, improving public transport and bicycle paths, and implementing the carbon tax. These changes caused a revolution in people’s daily lives to use more public transport and ween off cars and planes. There was also a food waste fee implemented to encourage people to waste and throw away less food. Through these alterations we have managed, as a population, to meet the greenhouse gas emission limit. Although, the climate is not healed in any way, we have avoided destroying the habitat and worsening the situation.
                                     <br><br>
Besides that, I have been talking about the public issues, but you have come a long way personally. 2020 was the year you made an effort to star eating less meat, but it was no where near vegetarian. That did not fully occur for about four years, and you stopped eating most animal products but just could not lay off the dairy and eggs occasionally. I have not fully embraced the vegan lifestyle, but I definitely now consider myself a climatarian, and I influenced those around to become climatarian too. You also did not make the change to public transport and biking right away, as that was dangerous without better public transport systems and unsafe roadways. But as soon as the government made those changes you did whatever you could to take those instead of your car. 2020 was also the year you encouraged your roommate to vote for the first time. It took a lot of convincing considering she kept saying that she really did not care. In 2025, after finishing all your schooling and getting a job, you finally moved into a small apartment in Downtown LA and lived with a close friend. This change was liberating because you moved away from home and starting living in the most eventful city around, but it also cut your carbon footprint immensely. 
                                     <br><br>
To finish off, it may seem hopeless and overwhelming now, but you can make the change, and the world can do it too.

Ken's last sentence--"incidentally, just in case YouTube is not around in 40 years, my goal is to also upload these comments to the Internet Archive in the hope that you can, if you are interested, look back on your message from the future in 2060"--really makes me shiver. There is no denying that future changes may be beyond our imagination. We are not sure what will exist and what will disappear. To be honest, I haven't thought about the possibility of the future so far. Thank Ken for giving me a chance to think. When I was in high school, I took a course called pop culture, which was about America in the middle of last century. Compared with the knowledge I learned in that class and my life now, I really feel the big difference. As Americans in the mid-20th century, they can't imagine what we have now, just as we can't imagine how four-dimensional space exists. This year is 2020. In the past three months, the whole earth has suffered too many disasters: Australian wildfires at the beginning of the year, the recent locust disaster in Pakistan, and the coronavirus sweeping the world. I feel that nature is taking revenge on humans because of their past destruction. Through what I learned in this class and what I saw on the Internet, I have clearly realized that the situation of the whole earth is not optimistic. What's worse, human beings are not eager to save the earth because most of the time they will give priority to their own interests. Ken taught us a set of ideas about how to improve the environment and climate. He was ashamed that his generation had had the opportunity to act but evaded it, so he hoped that our generation would take over this great responsibility. But I think it's hard for our generation to undertake this task. Human nature is selfish, especially the rich and the powerful. And human evolution won't change much in a hundred years. I'm really afraid that the task of improving the climate and environment will be ignored and passed on. When I was in primary school, I read a terrible fact in my book: we will use up a lot of natural resources, such as natural gas, at the end of the century. So I'm not very optimistic about the earth at that time. I hope more high-quality environmental protection videos can be promoted in my country because I feel that my country lacks systematic education in environmental protection. Maybe more people's understanding and attention can change the future.
                                     <br><br>
In 2060, I will be a 60 year old woman. I hope I can still live happily in the future.

Without a doubt, it is hard to imagine what the future will be like in this fast-growing world. Rapid developing technology greatly changed our lives in almost every aspect. For example, the spread of electronic devices only took a few years. In fact, 20 years ago, ordinary people hardly know how to use it, but now almost everyone has a phone. The short version of human nature prevents us from taking action that will only reveal its outcome in decades or even hundreds of years later. That is one of the reasons for the hardship to deal with environmental issues because people can't get benefits immediately. However, the severe situation has slowly influenced our lives. For instance, the haze in winter is so heavy in the place I live that people have to wear a face mask. I am sure that many people are aware of the climate crisis, but none think about it seriously: they still waste food and buy tons of clothes. I am not surprised about such a phenomenon because bad effects don't directly affect their lives: the water seems unlimited in water-tap and the air conditioning conceals the rising temperature in summer, etc. The climate change neither dramatically changes nor threatens our lives, instead, it slowly kills our future. If we don't take any actions, things will go worse. The worst outcome might be devastating and also ironic if human destroys their our future. For now, fossil fuels are the foundation for all developments since every production bases on it. Though the government is working on new energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, its process is too slow to solve the problem. More progressing actions should be taken and more propaganda should be spread. As an increasing number of people have a deeper understanding of the climate crisis and join the movement, the earth can be saved. Environment issue requires the union of humans for the Earth is ours home and we have the responsibility to protect it.

This video encourages me a lot to continuing what I did. Restraining consuming desire and reduce driving and flying can be difficult at first, I admit that I thought about giving up because I can hardly see the good outcome that I bring. It seems my effort is too little for the whole society. Fortunately, this video gives me support and motivation to keep on: next when I want to quit, I will close my eyes and think out what will future be like it no actions are being taken now.


<br><hr>
I have the same opinion with you after watching Ken's video this week. I also have not really think of the future yet and until this year all of the disasters which caused or not caused by mankind happened and I took this class. Then I started to realize that things might not, or even of course will not stay the same as everything is today. As you mentioned in your comment, starting from the beginning of 2020, the whole world has already been suffered from many disasters including Australian wildfire, locust disaster in Pakistan, and the coronavirus sweeping the worldwide. The current situation is not optimistic at all and as we learned from this class, huge portion of people actually did not realize the reality, and some of the generation might not even care about it. We are now facing huge problems but people are not eager to make changes to save our Earth. You did a very deep analyzation on human nature, and same as you even though Ken said he was ashamed on his own generation and he put a strong wish on ours, but the human nature are just selfish, not even 1% of the human beings will eat vega instead of meat with the thought that this is better for our Earth, including myself. I feel ashamed to say so for both others and myself, but this is the reality that we are far away from making the decision to take action to change our current situation. In 2060, I will also be a 60 year old woman, and I hope we all could live happily and healthy in the future on a better world.

To whom it may concerns,

It’s now 2060, and the circumstances are much better than what it has been in the 2020s. You cannot imagine how much we have done for the past 40 years regarding climate change. I want to tell my children that they should be grateful for what they have own so far because my generation has been offering them a grateful place to live. Thinking back in the year of 2020, it was a disaster of Coronavirus. It’s the same ideology as climate change, where people do not visualize the potential harm and ignore the impact of epidemics and climate change until everything goes wrong. It began a massive outbreak of Coronavirus around the world, and the U.S. experienced another rough period. Trump was not reelected, and the Democrats take in control for the 2020s, which is a crucial turning point. It was the outbreak of the Coronavirus once again unite the people together.

                                     <br><br>

There was more caring, love, the community being assembled, which also showed the world of the United States as a united nation. The disease was a significant attack on not only America’s economy but also its social dynamic and environmental actions. Additionally, there was a massive scandal of the controlling power of the wealthiest people, and people were able to see this as injustice and corruption of government. Especially, those people who had no health insurance were not able to even get diagnosed or tested if they get the disease. This evokes an enormous social movement, and the government responded to the issue. More people get health insurance and protections. Accordingly, this provokes another outbreak of environmental awareness, and another global social movement was tremendously enough to push forward the Green New Deal and environmental actions. You do not know that it was a social norm for us to eat meat and drive the car every day. I’m glad that we made the change throughout the 40 years, even though it was a challenging transition from a carbon-based community to a renewable energy-based community. People engage more with each other with their local community, but we are happier. There is less disease, a less natural disaster like a hurricane, flooding, tsunami, and wildfire, and I’m grateful for the change we have made. We need to keep controlling our meat consumption and carbon footprint, and we can make this world an even more peaceful place. For the first time, I think that this is a global community like the country border isn’t separation but a friendship.

Hello future me. If I wrote a letter about what I really think (fear) the world will look like in forty years I probably wouldn’t sleep tonight. And if I wrote this to "my future children" I'd be in tears before I finished the first paragraph. SO i’m going to be Digustingly optimistic. This is what your future will look like in 2060. 
                                     <br><br>
Your generation is going to avoid avert climate catastrophe. You are all going to band together and make structural changes that succesfully push the world into a greener future. You will make personal choices that reflect your values and the values of a changing world. The earth is being introduced to a new era of cultural mindfulness and equality. Here’s how. 
                                     <br><br>
 Starting with the 2020 presidential election you and the young people of America are going to vote. We are going to elect a democratic nominee who will push for a renewed and strengthened EPA. The president will respect science, human lives, and the earth. And at certain times when we believe that the president is not doing enough or is moving too slowly, we will push against the government until they speed it up. We are going to elect representatives that will support a fossil-fuel-free economy. We are going to elect local officials who will support a fossil-fuel-free community. In your town you and your neighbors are finally going to kick out fucking Steve Knight and get a politician who will divest from fossil fuels. In Canyon Country local backlash will stop mining activities and development deeper into the hills and the wash. Pressure from citizens concerned about fires due to climate change will lead to the devlopment of green practices like better public transportation and sustainable food. Food waste at the Vons near your house will drop dramatically because California is going to impliment laws and practices that restrict out of season produce and allow perfectly good, if ugly, food to remain on the shelves (or be donated). The endless construction of subdivisions that push further and further down plum canyon every year will halt as we realize that each family doesn’t need a five bedroom house. Living will become more compact, and use less energy. The traffic down Soledad in the mornings will become almost non-existent as people bike, bus, or walk to work. The days of waiting in traffic for forty five miniutes to move five miles as people get off the freeway to avoid the traffic on the 14 going into LA will be DONE as people live and work closer to home, supporting their communities directly. Our economy will shift to more barter based one, and people will begin to spend more time at home making their communities better. America is going to divest from fossil fuels. Full stop. We are going to rejoin the Paris agreement very soon, and usher in a new era of Climate Agreements that are upheld throughout the world. America will pressure its allies and trade partners into going green. The UN and third-party aid organizations will go into disadvantged countries being ravaged by climate change and help them build an infastructure that will support sustainable growth. This means clean water, clean energy, investing in local buisnesses (and helping set them up), providing birth control and sexual education, and advocating for Women’s education. We are going to stop fracking. We are going to stop flying in massive populations. We are going to stop expanding at a rate which we can not keep up with. The world population will majorly switch to vegan and vegetarian culture. As local farming and animal agricultrue rises in place of massive factory farms, demand for these institutions will decrease. As demand for this meat goes down, the emissions and waste caused by the animal agriculture industry will decrease. We are going to utilize the technology we have and revolutionize the farming, energy, and transportation sectors. This is going to provide new jobs, and inspire new scientific discoveries. We will devalue consumer culture. 
                                     <br><br>
 You are going to finally go fully vegetarian. You will only eat the eggs that comes out of chickens from you or your neighbors yards. You will live in the type of community you’ve always wanted. You’ll have a small apartment, with plants on the balcony and the roof, surrounded by friendly neighbors. God I hope you have a girlfriend by 2060 you nerd. You have a massive library full of books you THRIFTED because it’s WASTEFUL to keep buying all these brand new books Nicole this is a Direct call to action to stop buying books. If you’re reading this stop buying new books. You’re going to have to learn how to ride a bike. SOrry. I promise it’s not as bad as you think it is. You only fall over once (or twice). You’re going to stop making choices that make you feel sick and guilty. You’re going to stop eat cheeseburgers on “cheat” days, you’re going to stop driving around town in the middle of the night because it’s a good time to think. You are going to find a group of like minded people and take action and WORK for this future instead of waiting for it to come to you. You’re going to rip up your shame notebook with your “What to do in Various Apocolyptic Situation” plans and think about the future beyond dread. You’re going to stop putting off big desicions because you think they won’t matter because we’re all going to die. You are going to stop pretending like you don’t want a happy normal life and accept that it’s okay to want normal. I’m going to have a cat. Many of them. You’re going to live a life that matches up with the values you hold in your heart and it’s going to feel stupidly right. And this is going to sound like a dumb addition but Disneyland is going to go totally carbon free so that you can go to Disneyland without feeling so damn guilty everytime you go on a ride or buy a churro. And you’re going to start making these changes now. 
                                     <br><br>
 I hope you are happy. I hope the world has justice for people who are struggling right now and will struggle due to climate change. I hope we eradicate poverty (unlikely) and that every child has an education, and every person clean water, and damn it I do want America to be socialist. It works! I hope that in forty years there’s a world left to look on to. I hope that there is a future. I hope everything we have discovered and learned isn’t ereased. I hope we use the fucking hail mary of a chance we were given and use our compassion. Like how nuts is it that out of all the things our brains can do for us one of them is to feel for others. To love others and genuinely want to help them over ourselves. How amazing is that? I hope in the future we use that. That we not waste it, and use it to drive the world into progress.

Dear future,                                     <br><br>

Taking the Climate Crisis class on a whim for winter 2020 has opened my eyes to the dire situations that the planet is under. All throughout the world, news is reported of fires, devastation and disease. We are currently combating coronavirus and have only just extinguished the great fires of Australia.  Ocean levels are rising, acidity increasing, CO2 forming a thick blanket across the planet. What was once 10 years of time before climate change is irreparable has now shifted to a few years, and at this rate, will be the present reality. I earnestly hope that the world would just look past the greed and anger and accusations towards each other and just band together and stop this dilemma that will wipe out the human race. 
                                     <br><br>

Culture in the future must be so different from now. Personal carbon emitting vehicles must be obsolete. A largely plant based diet would take over the meat based one that dominates the planet. Things are still sort of normal at the moment, but I assume that deteriorating quality of life and depleting resources will force us humans to drastically change our lifestyle. By the looks of it, things will not correct itself until it is too late and the full repercussions are felt on every class level in society.
                                     <br><br>


Historians looking back must see us and the previous generations as fools. How can something so obviously imminent be ignored to such an extent by the masses? How can generations of humans not be empathetic to the pain and suffering that will result from their actions? Money fades, conflicts fade, but the problem will still remain. You in the future may look at our generation as worse than the previous due to our lack of action. 
                                     <br><br>


For the good of the planet and the human race, I hope that classes such as these become more widespread. I hope the message preached here is accepted by the masses, and that a change in culture can be made by the western world,especially the US, before its too late. I hope the US will once again lead the world in revolutionizing something; for climate change we still have much to do to catch up with the rest of the world and set an example to other countries.
                                     <br><br>

In 2060, I hope that the generation then will look back upon my generation as the one that took problems into our own hands. I hope you do not look back at us in anger just as we do to the boomer generation, though I feel that is the inevitable result. I hope this message finds you well and that humanity comes to its senses before its too late.

Dear to whomever is reading this is 2060,  
                                     <br><br>

I am writing this from the perspective of being a college student at UCSB in the year 2020. I am currently taking a climate crisis class and in the first week, my professor who is currently 60 years old apologized to my generation for his generation's negative impact to the environment. Unfortunately I would like to apologize for my generation as well. Since my professor's time, the youth have become more proactive with climate change and is more liberal. But what the youth have been doing to help the environment is still not enough. I apologize that our society, including me are still falling into the trap of consumerism. We are still wasteful in so many ways. As someone who lives in the United States, I want to apologize on the behalf of our country for making more than 1/4 of the CO2 emissions. I know that majority of people who flies comes from the United States and I wish that right now we could have other methods to get to other countries without flying. I wish that I can tell you that we switched to a completely vegan diet but we are still consuming more meat than ever. We are still using gas cars and doing many environmentally harmful things such as fracking.
                                     <br><br>



However, there are many things that my generation is doing that is a lot better than the generation before mine. 2020 is a time where things have the potential significantly help the climate crisis. Bernie Sanders has been shaking the political world by storm by his very democratic views. He has been really hitting home with the New Green Deal and I am hopeful that makes some change to the way the United States goes about with Climate Change. However, I feel that still politicians do not prioritize climate change and the republicans will not have his back and try to counter everything Sanders has in mind. What I hope is that when you read this, it was recorded in history that Donald Trump was voted out of office in 2020.
                                     <br><br>

I wish I can say that I am personally making a change to my life. I hope by 2060 I am living the true climatarian lifestyle of living in a small home, using public transportation, and being a vegan. I currently feel slightly hopeless for the future. It seems that the climate is doing nothing but getting worse. It is absolutely terrifying to see how extreme the weather has been and all the damage we have been making to the planet is starting to show. I am sad to know that in 2060 many things that we enjoyed in 2020 will no longer be available. 
                                     <br><br>

I really hope that you can be better than my generation.

Dear future me,

If you are reading this, that means the human race did its duty to the world and you are fortunate to be alive and I hope living much, much better. I know that 2020 began as a crazy year, but everyone in the world came together to fight the COVID19. This tragic event brought even more awareness of the ugly state America was in. It enabled us to see the awful healthcare system we have and learn from our panic, empathy and humaneness, towards others like refugees and immigrants who escape different kinds of diseases like that of violence. With Bernie later winning the Presidential election, there were a lot of drastic, but also much needed changes. I am proud of you for taking the personal action of making sure your friends went to the polling lines and that you voiced to all your acquaintances on social media the importance of it each and every election. Bernie brought us finally a system that puts its people above money and power. The Green New Deal brought down the powerful industry that was found in beef and fossil extraction. They now do not control and feed us lies. Our low-income communities now know the dangers that come with eating an excessive amount of animal meat. We no longer allow those corruptions to brainwash us into believing their food is good for us, when it was actually causing us earlier deaths. Obesity is now at its all-time low and people are now consuming cautiously.  The world has become aware of its actions, a big help from the free education we now have. More people are going to college and getting the free education we all deserved back in 2020. I feel so happy to see my low-income community flourish as my students are seeing the importance of everything around them and the impact they have as unique individuals. You picked the right path in uplifting and giving back to your community by going back and teaching. Angela and you are doing big things for the community with the expansion of community gardens all around the Inland Empire. You have brought the youth a safe space to grow and learn things that will benefit them endlessly like growing their own vegetables and discovering that we people of color are not enemies to each other but rather we empower each other. It took America a long time to look hard into itself and realize it was a shitty country. But once we saw the power we have as a whole people, we have come to a more sympathetic world, both towards others and the planet. You made sure you did your absolute best in participating in all the 10 person actions given to you by Ken. You followed them through and thanks to past you, I have found real happiness in my community and the job I have to motivate students to see how far we have come from 2020 and how there is only room for more growth. Thank you, Tiffany, for taking the education that you were lucky enough to receive and take it to be a better person for the world and those in it.

 This letter is an attempt to retroactively encourage you to continue your efforts in combatting the climate crisis and the world capitalist order. Your endeavors will not have been for nothing. The state of the world today is much better than you may imagine it to be. We’ve managed to curb global average temperatures to a 3℃ increase, although it is projected to rise a bit more. I know this is not ideal, but it is also not nearly as bad as it could’ve been. I live on the island nation of Indonesia, which has seen it’s fair share of suffering due to the ongoing climate crisis. With an average sea level rise of 10-14 inches and a tremendous increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms, millions have had to migrate inland or emigrate to other countries. This is the case for coastal communities all over the world. There are currently an estimated 600 million climate refugees scrambling for survival. 
                                      <br><br>

 You must be wondering what we did and didn’t do to end up here. Well, there was a fairly substantial mass mobilization for climate action, as well as an international political movement for decarbonizing the global economy. However, these actions were much too slow and not nearly radical enough. Although the Green New Deal failed to see the light in 2020, it was implemented in 2024. Massive efforts were taken to shift the economy from fossil fuels to “clean energy.” Millions of jobs were created in the green energy sector. The US government enacted a universal basic income and health care for all. They managed to phase out a significant chunk of individual automobile use with a massive reconstruction of its public transportation infrastructure. This initiative gradually triggered similar movements in other countries as well. But the scale of action was not dramatic enough, nor quick enough. It took until 2035 to reach carbon neutrality, and by then we’d emitted far more than the agreed upon carbon budget. Although we did prevent the worst case scenarios of climate change, we have failed in so many other respects. The fossil fuel economy continued to profit off the slow transition for another decade, as the creation of green technologies required a great deal of fossil fuels to put into effect. Our biggest failure however, is in the fact that we completely overlooked the structural inequalities and violence that were perpetuated by the capitalist system which created the crisis in the first place. Our reformist approach allowed the continuation of this inherently flawed model. Although the world is not a total wasteland, it is a social justice nightmare. The marginalization of indigenous peoples, nations of the Global South, women, low-income communities, and other vulnerable groups has only gotten worse.
                                     <br><br>

 So what could have been done to improve our current condition? What can your people still do to make the world of my generation more equitable, just, and sustainable? Degrowth is the answer. Your attempts to address the world crises within the framework of global capitalism were not radical enough. You attempted to change everything without changing anything. The perpetuators of injustice continued to profit and thrive and exploit. The victims of exploitation continued to suffer. Although we addressed our global carbon emissions, we did not address the detrimental imperative of economic growth which, although relatively dormant now, will continue to fester until it creates a new crisis in the coming decades. We’ve only trimmed the visible weeds, rather than torn them up from the roots. It is up to your generation to implement a radical economic transformation. Your people are so focused on the nuances of the global crisis that you’ve been blinded to the most obvious solution: the capitalist economic model. It is time for you people to recognize the lies you’ve been told about economic growth, about human progress, about the meaning of our lives on this planet and within this global community. We are not the masters of the Earth; in fact, we’ve become quite the cancer. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can choose to be different. We can choose to prioritize happiness over wealth. We can choose to be social creatures, not isolated ones. We can choose altruism over greed. We can choose empathy over rationale. We can choose spiritual meaning over artificial meaning. By learning to reconnect with the natural world, with each other, and with ourselves, by emphasizing love and harmony rather than progress and success, we have the potential to create a thriving global society. A world in which many worlds fit. A world in which we are not in direct competition with each other. A world in which we can all sustain. But we must rebuild from the ground up.
                                     <br><br>

 I know you are struggling to stay hopeful in times like these. If I were alive in the early 2020s, I would probably have given up, as you often consider doing. Please do not stop fighting, our lives depend on it.

40 years ago, the global society was facing its biggest threat: the climate crisis. We had known that the climate was changing as a result of human action for decades before we started witnessing the impacts firsthand. In 2017, people began to pay a little more attention as extreme weather events became more intense and frequent. Year after year, what was known as the deadliest disaster, kept being surpassed by an even deadlier one. Hurricanes and wildfires ravaged parts of the US, costing the nation billions of dollars. Yet year after year, we managed to keep delaying action. The fossil fuel industry kept getting away with its merciless exploitation of people and the environment because the Trump Administration favored corporate interests that put profit over people. 
                                     <br><br>

It wasn’t until the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 that the systemic injustices that made up the foundation of America were exposed to everyone. The shortcomings of the broken healthcare infrastructure of America could no longer be ignored as people were unable to get tested due to poor or no healthcare coverage. Instead of the government using emergency funding to ensure access to proper healthcare for all Americans, it gave bailouts to the banks and the fossil fuel industry. 
                                     <br><br>

Things were looking incredibly dire. Governments issued social distancing mandates that led to the closure of restaurants, bars, wineries, etc. ‘Business as usual’ was completely disrupted. People fought over toilet paper and sanitation supplies until there was eventually none left on the store shelves. As the situation grew worse, people were forced to quarantine within their homes. Cities became ghost towns as society isolated itself. 
                                     <br><br>

But then something amazing happened… As the world was on lockdown to keep the virus from spreading, carbon emissions dropped drastically. And whether it was out of pure boredom or genuine curiosity, people finally found the time to recognize what was going on around them. They began realizing that the same systemic injustices that exacerbated the climate crisis were exacerbating the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, people began taking a stand through whatever means necessary. Since social gatherings were still forbidden, a massive online campaign on climate action took hold of America. People questioned the unjust social arrangements of society and looked for a leader to spur this rebellion. As 2020 was an election year, sights were set on Bernie Sanders. 
                                     <br><br>

Bernie won the election by a landslide in November of 2020. He immediately began putting climate policies into play and correcting the gross wealth disparities of the nation. As individuals, we recognized that a holistic approach was necessary to combat this crisis and work in sync with the political moves taken. As a collective society, we mobilized together and prevented the most catastrophic crisis of all time.

<p>
It's me! How were things back in 2020? Gas-powered vehicles were illegal back then too right? Well, anyway... 2060 is a strange, but amazing time. In the 2020 U.S. election, the democrats took back congress AND the presidency, and they immediately set to work passing The Green New Deal. After a few years of gridlock in congress due to the heavy lobbying of some stubborn climate denialists (I can't believe you still had those back then), we passed The Green New Deal and set a goal of reaching net-zero emissions and 100% renewable energy by the year 2030.
                                      <br><br>

Despite the best of efforts, we didn't quite reach our goals by 2030. By that time, only about 60% of our energy was from renewables, but both Exxon Mobil and Chevron declared bankruptcy in the early 2030's due to their failure to properly transition their businesses away from oil and into the wind, solar and hydroelectric industries that power us today. The election of Elon Musk as president in 2032 really gave us the kick that we need to reach 100% renewables and net-zero emissions, and he did an even better job helping the communities and workers most impacted by climate change and the switch to a green economy. With his guidance, and the help of vice president Joe Rogan, all employees of the now antiquated coal and oil industries were given free job training and government subsidies for two years as they transitioned into their new careers. Most made easy shifts to similar jobs in the burgeoning renewables sector, while others went to work for the dozen or so electric vehicle companies that have sprouted up in recent decades. The largest company, Swiftly, makes autonomous buses that now take up most highways in the U.S., only joined by the few oddballs who still prefer to drive their own cars. In cities, cars have been mostly banned or restricted to only a few streets, with San Francisco being the first to enact such regulations in late 2029. Nowadays, urbanites get around on e-bikes or autonomously driven buses and mass transit systems. It's amazing how much cleaner and less congested Los Angeles is now!
                                     <br><br>
 
By the time we finally reached our emissions and energy goals it was 2038, and climate change was beginning to have a massive impact on our earth. In 2040, the small pacific island of Tuvalu became the first country to officially force all of it's citizens to relocate due to rising sea levels. It wouldn't be the last to do so however, as by 2048 nearly 60% of the Netherlands's residents were forced to move to neighboring countries as the ocean continued to encroach on their low lying land. Here in the United States, we felt similar effects, with Miami subjected to nearly 10 feet of sea level rise and California set ablaze by wildfires covering nearly 20% of the state at one time. In fact, your house in California burned down when a wildfire came through in the late summer of 2045. Don't worry though, by that time most people had realized that the expensive and wasteful homes of previous generations really weren't going to cut it if we wanted to save our earth, so it only took me about a month to have another copy of your 800 square foot cabin 3D printed and shipped via high speed.
                                     <br><br>
 
Big homes aren't the only destructive practice that we've kicked since 2020 though. These days, almost everyone I know eats a vegetarian or plant-based diet, either due to their concern for the environment or in response to some of the alarming research that has come out recently regarding the consumption of meat from industrial agriculture practices. Food waste has also been a big issue over the past few decades, and a waste tax was even enacted in 2042 to punish families that failed to  meet the new limits on food waste set forth in recent legislation. I've owned a composter for years now, and I even grow much of my own food in one of the many community gardens around. The final bad habit to reach it's demise was conventional air travel,  as companies like Southwest and United Airlines kept flying strong up until 2050 or so. By that time, their ability to stay in business was seriously hampered by the massive carbon taxes they were forced to pay in order to offset their harmful practices, and all airlines have now either closed down or transitioned into the new personal electric drone business.
                                     <br><br>
 
I hope I was able to adequately update you on all of the changes that have occurred here on earth since 2020. It's pretty crazy to think about how close we were to the point of no return regarding our environment, and I am forever grateful to your generation for being the ones to finally lead the switch to a greener economy and healthier planet! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get to my job as an atmospheric water harvester. Cheers!

In 2020, we are struggled to solve the problems created by global warming, which is one of the biggest issues in our society. As temperature rises, more natural disasters happen. Many plants and animals are hard to survive. The reasons behind climate change lie in human behaviors. Since the Industrial Revolution, we have done many things that harm the environment to a large extent. As a freshman at UCSB, I take the course English 23 The Climate Crisis. I acquired a lot of knowledge about global warming. I think one of the most important decisions is to take action immediately to change the current situation. We have hesitated for a long time. If we continue waiting and do not make changes, the problems would be more severe. In 2060, I hope the situation would get better, and everyone would take action to protect our environment. I wish to see a world where every creature could enjoy their life.

A message from the future:
                                     <br><br>

2020, what a year this was. I became a senior in UCSB in Music Studies and Mathemantics double-major which are the first steps of my current life. Besides of all the major requirement courses, I was required to take GE courses to get a degree. Well, I have to thank UCSB putting this requirement, otherwise I would never take English 23 and would never meet my professor Ken Hiltner who was an amazing activist for fighting against climate crisis. Meeting him in my early 20s is a fortune that made me realized how dire our situation were in 2020. I remember when university cancelled my first final due to Thomas Fire and ashes flowing in the air. It was a horrible time, but I optimistic and thought the fire was once in a decade thing. I was wrong. The fire visited our campus every year and our lives had been drastically impacted. If I can tell, that was the first sign telling myself that climate crisis was coming and it was coming fast. Ken told us the same thing and showed us how we got there. Fossil fuel companies made up misinformation, climate deniers refuse to believe climate crisis is coming and blamed us being fooled by scientists. Yet, with my very own eyes seeing the nature had gone mad, I decided to take actions. I started riding bike to school, enjoyed traveling on train, limited my air travels, gave up meat and committed to a plant-based diet (you should be proud of this!) and most importantly, I gave up the life of consumerism and living in minimalism.


                                     <br><br>

I am so grateful that I made these choices in my early 20s and have continued to do so to this day. However, if I were the only one who made the changes, life will not be as good as what I have today. I remember when I became an enviromentalist and advocated for a better future, I heard people refusing to make their changes. But luckily, most people in our generation have sooner or later joined us to make changes. They either voted for enviroment advocates or used social media to propose an enviromentally friendly future. Others have their perspective way of making changes. The effect was not immidiate: we have seen disatreous tornados and fires, but fortunately, they have been less and less cases in recent years.
                                     <br><br>


I am grateful that our generation have correct what Ken's generation had done wrong. Our planet was on the edge of facing a dramatic ecological change and human kind and other species may never survive. If I were not and our generation were not acting and keep being ignorant by doing nothing, I may never had the chance to write this letter. I am proud that our generation made today happen and I think Ken would be proud that his effort was not wasted. Now watching our next generation living vitally while also aware of sustainability, I am hopeful that they can live in an even better future.

A letter to my future self,
                                     <br><br>


It’s 2020 and I’m hoping the world has changed for the better because so far this year has only been full of dread and it’s only month three. It started off with an almost war, then a devastating fire, and now a virus that could destroy the world. While the virus itself only has a 3% death rate, we fear for our loved ones who wouldn’t be able to handle the virus. As I’m sure you remember, the year hasn’t started off great. I went in optimistic believing my freshman year of college would be full of friends and the beach, but now I’m leaving Santa Barbara until July and I won’t see my friends for a long time. While I’m sad I won’t see my friends,  I know this is a necessary change we need to make to stop the spread of something deadly.

                                     <br><br>

I wish we could take these extreme measures with more than just the coronavirus, but unfortunately, it seems we only care when it’s something that’s killing us off quickly. I believe by the time you see this, climate change will be killing us off quickly and it’ll be too late to do anything, but, I’m going to choose to be optimistic and hope people make the same changes I have been slowly making in 2020.
                                     <br><br>

My beef consumption has down gone greatly, and for once in my life, I’m choosing to drive home instead of fly home. I know driving still does a ton of damage, but I’m hoping I can keep making small steps each month towards a better tomorrow. I think before I grab an extra piece of chicken and think “will I really ate that” and if the answer is even maybe, I put it back so I don’t grab unnecessary food and waste it. I hope by the time I read this I will be completely vegetarian and have a smaller carbon footprint. I will try my best to achieve this goal.
                                     <br><br>


If everyone begins making these changes now, plus the other changes, such as smaller living and many other changes, I believe when I read this again, our planet will be healthier and climate change will no longer be the enormous problem it is. We’ll live in a world where we don’t have to worry about our children's future. Unexpected flooding and fires will be at an all-time low. This is a world I dream of not just for myself, but for all the future generations.

Forty years ago, you were learning about the climate crisis and its evolution from what it was to what it is now. Just as you did in 2020, I would like to do the same now, in 2060, and discuss what the climate crisis is now. I would first like to remind you of what the climate crisis was in 2020. During that time, large fires burned in the Amazon, Australia, and California. There was a tornado near Santa Barbara and other extreme weather patterns. The United States was responsible for ¼ of greenhouse gases. Emphasis was put on electric cars, CCS technologies, and other technological solutions. Yet, very little emphasis was put on how to change our behavior as humans. In the year 2020, you were one of those people. You drove to most destinations and flew numerous times a year. You ate meat almost every day of the week and did not think twice about the food you wasted. You weren’t very materialistic, but let yourself be a bystander of the crisis that was directly in front of you. If I was completely honest with myself back then, you hated learning about the climate crisis as it didn’t seem that collective change would occur, and as such, climate change would be uncontrollable. It’s true, unless people work to decrease the climate crisis, it will get worse. Despite pessimistic waves of thought, you have mostly been optimistic about most things, which has paid off here. At this time, the United States has finally woken up to address the climate crisis, though there is still a lot of work to be done. A modified version of the Green New Deal was passed, and the US has shifted to 80% renewable energy sources, thanks to new government incentives. That is roughly eight times the amount of renewable energy used in 2018, but it’s not 100%. A carbon tax was also introduced. Companies and citizens were held liable for their use of fossil fuels. The beef industry has greatly diminished. The government has become more involved in the climate crisis than it has ever before. 
                                     <br><br>
However, I would like to discuss more of the actions that you have personally done. Among the twenty things your professor mentioned, you have nearly completed all of them. You have switched to a plant-based diet and have most of your food grown in your own backyard. You and your partner live in a comfortable home with your adopted children. Biking to work and local places has been the routine for the past thirty years and instead of flying multiple timers per year, you now take the train. What I think may be your biggest influence has been your willingness to teach about the climate. You are a professor of chemistry and have taught courses relating to the climate crisis, at least from a scientific point of view. You’ve dedicated your research to the climate in order to continue to track its patterns and determine how to optimize technology to reduce the world’s carbon footprint. More important than your research has been the outreach you’ve done. You visit middle and high schools to communicate climate change to the younger generation and allow them to work on projects to reduce their emissions. Not only do you discuss the science, but you have also presented easy ways (like the list Ken mentioned) to help mitigate their impact on the climate. Knowledge is only power if shared. Through the outreach program, you have visited over 300 schools and have tracked their progress as well. Though not every school has been receptive to the changes, the majority of schools, and the student body within, have changed their habits for the betterment of the earth. There is still a lot of progress to be made. The earth has not warmed, but certainly has not cooled. The progress made in the past forty years need to continue. The United States’ goal is to switch to 100% renewable energy by the end of the century. This is certainly possible, for other countries have already done so. The world has finally joined together to combat climate change, though other countries have been arguably better than us.

Hello. The year is 2060 and the planet is on the brink of ultimate cataclysm and calamity. I have probably already died of some sort of lung disease at this point, but I will nonetheless go through what has happened in the last 40 years.
                                     <br><br>
In 2020, the election was plagued by a novel virus, the USA was unable to control this pandemic as well as other countries. The Trump administration used this opportunity to undertake a massive campaign of disinformation and voter suppression. In November 2020, Biden lost the general election to Trump, handing him a second term. The next 4 years will be marked by apathy, denial of science, and a regression in many social aspects. Environmental agencies were all disbanded, climate scientists de-funded and ridiculed, and scholars and activists hunted down mercilessly by a relentless administration. Abortion was rendered illegal on a federal level, amongst many other changes, and no progress was made on a political level to combat climate change. 
                                     <br><br>
Only the few college-educated elites made the appropriate cultural changes in order to combat the climate crisis. For many Americans, the goal was merely survival in what was now a highly unequal Police State. Elsewhere in the world the story was similar. After the great Bangladesh floods and the Great India famine of 2026, millions of refugees arrived in Europe, escalating pre-existing tensions between the natives and these refugees. In 2029, the remaining EU members (Spain, Poland, and a few other had left) unite as one country. The politics in this new EU country are rather environmentally friendly, but their approval of massive waves of refugees causes outrage, leading to a coup and ultimately a bloody civil war.
                                     <br><br>
In Asia, China has asserted itself as a dominant authoritarian empire. After conquering the Philippines and North Korea (embroiled in a civil war of its own), China emerges as a global power. China continued to burn coal in massive amounts, ignoring the climate. The 2030s was a decade where the real impacts of the climate crisis started to show. Atolls in the pacific were submerged, California was on fire causing millions of people to flee their homes, parts of African were becoming simply unliveable and the Great NYC Flood of 2039 lead to a humanitarian disaster in the context of an incompetent administration. 
                                     <br><br>
In the 2040s, it was evident that humanity had failed to combat the climate crisis. The year 2020 had been a historic turning point, engraved in all minds as the pivotal moment where humanity signed its death sentence. The UN was forcefully disbanded in 2042 by the US and China, in an unforeseen alliance of autocratic powers. The EU, recovering from civil war, would be unable to take more measures to stop the climate crisis. Dozens of millions died every year from famine and heat death in African alone. In 2045, the renowned climate champion Ken Hiltner announces that the damages of the climate crisis are now absolutely irreversible. The next 15 years are marked by a hopeless passivity of humanity, a mass witnessing of the end.

Its the year 2060, everyone lives inside because the air is too toxic to breathe, and all plant life has been wiped out on earth. Everything we loved  about nature is gone, there is no more wildlife to watch even the water is undrinkable. This all could have been avoided had we as a people decided to make changes so long ago. Scientist tried to find ways to reverse the change that was happening, but the damage was irreversible. Many people pointed at politicians and higher ups saying that it was all their fault instead of looking at themselves. Too much time was spent pointing fingers and protesting instead of actually making change. This soon led to more and more problems happening in our world, riots broke out, people died, and all people did was point fingers. Had people actually looked up and saw that change doesn't just come from some president or political but from yourself, had communities chosen to better their climate instead of just waiting for someone to tell them to do something, our planet just might have been saved. A simple virus destroyed a large portion of our population as a result of ignorance, people chose to ignore the warnings and go about their lives spreading and contracting the disease and then got mad when the  government ran out of solutions, had they listened at first to quarantine themselves, then this would have never happened. I look back on climate movements and protests from 2020 and all I saw was people blaming and pointing fingers saying this person is the only cause of our troubles instead of trying to fix it themselves. Resources going to advertising that this soliton was doing this thing wrong or something like that could've gone to benefitting the environment instead. Many people released that politics is not the only case of climate change, its people's ignorance, its people sitting benign  screen whining that its getting hotter instead of going out and educating people on how to reduce their carbon footprint. Looking back on what I did to make change, I did my part, but could definitely had done more. Switching to riding my bike to work reduced my emissions and switching to more a more sustainable lifestyle helped. I wish I had done more to help others though, maybe by educating my parents about what they could do or going through my community sharing ways to be more eco friendly. Overall, i think much more could have been done to save  our planet and i think people spent all their time waiting for someone to speak up and do the work for them instead of actually doing it themselves. You don't have to be a politician to make a difference, just the smaller change does more than doing nothing.

I would like to say that the way the world handled climate change since the year 2020 has been black or white. I’d like to say that as a world we were able to immediately get our act together when the big consequences of climate change began showing themselves all over the world.  I would love to say that everyone who didn’t care about climate change and even those that didn’t believe in it magically changed their minds and began making huge differences overnight. However, it was all so much more complicated than that. 2020 was my second year of college and by this point I was a flaming environmentalist. 2020 was the year I became a vegetarian. It was the year I began to staunch the purchasing of consumer goods from all over the world, and began investing in local businesses and farmers markets. It was the year I learned how to garden and compost. It was the year when I gave up as many single use plastics as I could. It was the year when my eyes were finally opened. I can’t say the same for the rest of the country. Things were looking bleak. I was constantly riddled with environmental depression and living with feelings of fear and defeat. In my opinion, if the government hadn’t stepped in, if the people hadn't demanded that the government do its job to protect ALL of its citizens present and future, things would be even worse than they are now. We knew that in order to stop most of the damage we had to act in the decade of 2020-2030, and many amazing things began happening. But these were mostly small changes. Citizens did what they could regardless of the government. More and more people began eating plant based diets and wasting less food. Community gardens became way more popular and local eating started to be the norm instead of the anomaly. People began composting in their backyards and in their homes. Biking became more popular and people began carpooling whenever possible. But it was still all happening too slowly. All the while, passionate people were fighting for their voices to be heard in government. We were trying our hardest to change the hearts and minds of the people who were still too scared to make these huge changes and start living a sustainable lifestyle. The Democrats slowly started to take control of the government and by 2036, we finally had policies that were being enabled and enforced widespread. Single use plastics were now mostly banned. Carbon fees have caused the use of fossil fuels to go way down. The government began subsidizing renewable energy and banned the majority of fracking and drilling for oil. Over the course of the years, people began to reject consumer society as they realized what was truly important in life. But these victories arose in the midst of grave consequences caused by the hesitance and opposition of climate change based action. Wildfires ravaged the land. Diseases started spreading, starting with COVID 19. Storms were worse than ever and caused flooding and landslides. Crops around the world began failing and droughts were so bad in some places that people died of thirst. Millions of people had to migrate because they either didn't have access to life giving resources, their homes were destroyed or under water, or the land died from lack of water and extreme heat. It took all of these disasters and more to get people to open their eyes and realize that the climate crisis would directly affect them, affluence or not. It took people losing loved ones and seeing the mass tragedy and fear to realize that it was the people around you, the communities you built, the relationships you fostered that were the most important things in life. Not how much money you had in the bank or stashed away in useless material items. Had we acted in the decades leading up to 2020, or even rapidly after, we could have saved billions of lives. But we didn’t. Human selfishness and fear caused us to continue in a state of blissful ignorance until it was too late. We are slowly beginning to rebuild our nation. We are slowly recovering from the anger of mother nature who showed us what happens when you pollute and destroy the earth. This time we are doing it right. I believe that the world is finally learning from its mistakes, and will continue to advance in such a way that puts the important things in life first. Things that ensure environmental justice for all life on this planet, not just humanity. It was all thanks to the people who never stopped dreaming. Never stopped fighting for others who didn’t have a voice. To those who never gave up on what was right, no matter how impossible it seemed.

Dear wife

                                     <br><br>

It’s your husband. Today is the anniversary of our 30-year marriage (if I can get married when I'm 30), I don't know if you remember. Over these years, we have gone through ups and downs together, helping and supporting each other. I have a lot to say to you, and listen to me slowly.

                                     <br><br>

First of all, thank you very much for your company. All along, I haven't given you a good material life. Others would buy their beloved wife gorgeous dresses and beautiful high-heeled shoes that can be stacked into a hill. But I only bought you cheap clothes. Others’ luxury cars are full of garages, and can obtain a lot of envious eyes every time. But we only have a broken car that starts with vegetable oil. Others have their servants' care when they go out, opening cars’ doors or holding umbrellas during raining. But we only have a rusty bicycle, which creaks when we ride it. Others’ yards are full of fruit trees and colorful flowers. But in our yard, the cries of chickens and ducks are annoying, and the pungent smell of feces in the vegetable fields is disgusting. Honestly, normal people can't accept it for a long time. But you, my lover, are still diligent and living with me. I still remember that once a young girl passed by us with jewels on her body. She was particularly beautiful in the sunshine. Gucci's bag was on her back, showing her dignity. I looked at you with guilty eyes, but you said it doesn't matter, the inner beauty is the real beauty. At that moment, I knew that I met the right person.

                                     <br><br>

In fact, I've explained to you what I've done. It's not that I don't have money or try to mean to you, it's that one of my freshman classes moved me. It was a course on the environmental crises. Global warming is becoming more and more serious. We all need to make changes to save the future of the earth, from cherishing food to voting. Only when our behavior affects the people around, people's behavior affects the country, and the state's behavior affects the world, can the whole earth have a sustainable development future. 

                                     <br><br>

Over these years, we have seen the earth getting better. Developed countries began to levy carbon taxes, and help developing countries alleviate the suffering of climate problems. People prefer vegetarianism, and reduce the size of their rooms. Most importantly, public transport is more developed, and sustainable energy is enough to provide human daily needs. People don't need to emit a lot of carbon dioxide to survive. The sky is blue, the air is fresh, there are more trees, and people are happier. These are the efforts of our generation after generation. And the earth truly becomes a better place.
                                     <br><br>


Again, thank you very much for your understanding and accompanying.

                                     <br><br>

Love,                                     <br><br>

Your husband

The year is 2060. Lots has happened over the past 40 years both on a personal and global level. I personally went Vegan more than 35 years ago, have a child, and no longer rely upon a gas powered vehicle to get me from one place to another. I have a smaller house, stay indoors more often, and often wonder about what could have been.
                                     <br><br>

It took Democrats until 2024 to really start making significant changes to our policies regarding climate change. We started just a little too late and those first 4 years were some of the most frustrating and detrimental to the planet. Biden won the presidency which was obviously an upgrade from Trump but he didn’t do enough to change our habits, our policies, and our lifestyles to implement real lasting change. 
                                     <br><br>

Then in 2024 we finally got a president that took climate change seriously. And after 4 more years of worse storms, more brushfires, and less wildlife Americans finally understood that it was time for a real change. We signed a type of green deal that would take us off our dependence of foreign oil, natural gases, and instead moved us to solar, electric, and other forms of renewable energy by 2040. It wasn’t a perfect plan and was too late for many in parts of the world where sea level rise could mean loss of homes. But it was a good plan. It’s just that this plan should have been implemented many or at least 4 years earlier. 
                                     <br><br>

The changes were hard on many of us. Some of my friends were out of work. Some had a difficult time changing their diets. But ultimately it did what it was intended to do. It stopped much of the climate from getting even worse. We still have big storms, too many fires, and heat waves that never seem to end, but we got to a place that kept us stable instead of this downhill trajectory we seemed to be on for the 50+ years prior to 2024.  
                                     <br><br>

By 2040 we had gotten 99% off of fossil fuels as a country and that was a huge change in of itself considering how dependent we had been on them for well over 100 years. We also got better public transportation including subways and better bus systems on the West coast. This helped out immensely with less traffic, less emissions, and less stress in our daily lives. My only thought was why didn’t we do this sooner. Why did we wait so long to make such good and helpful changes to us individually and to the planet.  
                                     <br><br>

Ultimately the hardest thing for many people was switching our diets to less meat, and a more plant based diet. Luckily, by 2035 we were growing artificial meat that to many of us tasted as good as the real thing. This helped many change to a diet that was much better to the environment and climate as a whole. It took awhile but this also made such a big difference in our waste and greenhouse gas emissions. 
                                     <br><br>

Then only 10 years ago we finally started taking CO2 out of the atmosphere. This is the single best thing we could do for the planet but I can’t help but wonder why it took so long to get started. I’m excited for the future of my child, and their children, and the generations that follow but I can’t help but feel upset that most of my life is over and only now in 2060 is the planet really started to heal and go back to the way it once was. I feel resentful that it took most of my life to start making the changes that we could have and should have made so long ago. But, I’ll admit, it’s better late than never.

Dear future kids I may or may not have, 
                                     <br><br>

It’s 2060, but I am writing this letter to you from the UCSB library during week 10 of winter quarter 2020. As I’m writing this, we are in the midst of the climate crisis, less than a year away from the presidential election, the coronavirus has spread to many countries, and I have 3 finals next week. The primaries just happened last week and I hope you know I did my best to vote for someone that had your future in their best interests. 
                                     <br><br>

At this current moment, I am very optimistic that our country and the planet did what it had to do to save the earth. A lot of people right now still are ignorant that our planet is in trouble and call the crisis that we are in, a hoax. People still don’t understand that we have to start taking action in order to still have this earth for future generations. 
                                     <br><br>

I hope people have taken action and are still doing so. I want you to know that I’m going to start doing what I can in order to do my part. I will start eating with the planet’s best interests at heart. I will try limiting myself in the things that I buy (I don’t need a lot of stuff). When I am able to start driving, I will try to limit my car usage. I will start educating others (especially my friends and family) about the climate crisis and what each of us can do about it. 
                                     <br><br>

This letter is me telling you that I am going to try (and hopefully I did) my part in helping with the climate crisis. If you know that I did something that heavily contributed to emitting more CO2, such as being a frequent flyer, you hold me accountable for that.
                                     <br><br>

More than anything I want both of you to be able to live on a planet that was like, or better, than the one I grew up in. Where you could see the beautiful scenery we are offered, breathable air, the chance to see many different kinds of animals, etc. My hope is that we are able to give back to our generation. It is not fair for you and future generations to live on a planet that is uninhabitable.
                                     <br><br>

Hopefully, the Democratic party takes back the White House in the 2020 presidential election. I hope that the people keep voting for politicians that care about the climate crisis. Right now, it is difficult to tell who will win, but I stay optimistic. 

                                     <br><br>
As I sit here writing this, I am approximately one mile away from the Pacific Ocean. It is a chilly day outside, but the sun is still peaking through the clouds. The air is fresh and breathable. Maybe one day you will experience something like this. Everyday I wake up and see the beauty the earth has to offer us. It is my responsibility that you have the chance to see it as well.
                                     <br><br>

With love, your Mom

<p>
It’s now 2060 if you are reading this that means one of two thigs. 1 we all did something to help stop emitting an excess amount of CO2 into the atmosphere or 2 we have done nothing to help climate change in fact it is much worse. I would like to think that we all did something, and that climate change Is not a concern for us. I hope that you are still a vegetarian and haven't caved into the delicious Peruvian dishes, I know mom makes it difficult with her amazing cooking. I hope that you and your family are all vegetarian and are biking to work/school, buying less stuff, and living in a cute little house. I hope that Chris (my older brother) also changed his eating habits even though I know he loved to eat meats especially Lomo Saltado (Peruvian dish) whenever we would have family gathering and mom would cook it. I know his plans were to have 4 kids I hope he does so but environmentally. 
                                      <br><br>

If we have failed to stop climate change I want to apologize to my children and those that will be affected by climate change for living the way they are, it was the duty of my generation to do something about climate change and we failed you guys. I am sorry that we could not do anything in time. This is what I was afraid of, that my children would have to suffer as well. The generation before me failed us and we are now failing you guys, I hope that all generations can unite, and do something about climate change, it is killing people all over the world. Temperatures are rising where people cannot work out in the open and death is a probable danger, species have died off, and sea levels are only rising more and more decade after decade. 
                                      <br><br>

I want you to know that we tried to do something we have tried to implement more bike lanes so people can bike to work, school, etc. to cut down on the use of cars. Have made buses more accessible. The Green New Deal, I thought that it would have had a large effect on the climate change, I guess it is still in progress. We took too long and I am sorry. I hope that you guys do not lose hope and continue to fight against climate change. We need a carbon tax, we need to educate all women, stop wasting so much food, and simply stop eating meat move to a plant-based diet. It will take time, but we need to change now.

Dear future self,
                                      <br><br>
We all could have tried harder in making the world a better place for ourselves and future generations if we knew what to value. We have been too consumed by the wrong things: faster, newer, bigger, better. We have the technology and the intellect to change the world around us but choose not to, for what? Allowing the rich to stay rich and get richer? To eat fake food filled with chemicals? To drive everywhere instead of walk and become more and more unhealthy? We have the capacity and the choice to induce radical change in our world, developing a system that doesn’t oppress communities and creates fruitful and fulfilling opportunities for all to seek after, rather than making a system that makes it impossible to crawl out of poverty, fight inequality and instill any sort of actual change. This whole societal and political structure, we have created, we have allowed people to become too powerful to where the shots we think we are calling are all decided for us first behind the scenes, giving us scenarios and events to sway us in a certain direction, giving us only one option, making sure no real change will ever be enacted. But since we created it, we can change it. We have the choice to stop what we are doing right now, and work together to make actual changes for our environment, which directly affects our political and social climate. Weirdly enough, the changes we make in our day to day lives and our ideologies will make the biggest changes in saving our planet.

                                      <br><br>

Firstly, we have the choice in what we choose to buy. Whether it’s where it’s been made or what it is, these things can determine how we affect the environment around us. Buying fast-fashion brands from big corporations and shopping out big supermarkets that take in produce and products from thousands of miles away, along with falling for the need to replace “old things” with new ones every season is only destroying us all. Besides downsizing our consumption, we must downsize our mindset on consumerism itself. We need to erase the ideology that we always need to buy, buy, buy. We don’t have to be minimalists, but whatever we have been doing since the Industrial Revolution is not the route that we should have taken. Capital, or even capitalism itself, has destroyed any sense of actual value in our lives as materialism has taken over our psyches. Being the richest person in the room may be more detrimental to our surroundings than we truly think, and I hope that one day we could change that, soon, in that maybe the future of our planet can exist to see another millenia. 
                                      <br><br>
Secondly, I hope that we come to our senses over how we view our life goals: will we prioritize happiness over wealth in the future? Will we care about the people around us and how our choices will affect them? I hope. We have to let go of our romanticization of the American Dream, we must redefine it if we want to have a plentiful future for ourselves and our kids. We must value our well-being, hopefully we elected Bernie Sanders, someone who is truly passionate and genuine in what he says he wants to accomplish and believes in. I fear us not being able to progress, and redefine our future. I am worried that we will not act quick enough, that the people who are in charge now will stay in charge, that we will not be able to create a sustainable environment, that we may not make the choices that we need to make to save our planet. Hopefully, we do. Hopefully we actually come to our senses before its too late.

                                      <br><br>

Sincerely,
                                      <br><br>
20-year-old me.

In the year 2020 I became a climatarian and a freegan. I reduced the amount of beef I consumed, switched to a more plant-based diet, began eating the perfectly fine food local supermarkets discard, and started eating everything I put on my plate. I didn’t just stop wasting food, but I stopped wasting stuff. I bought less stuff, and the stuff I did acquire was often used from second-hand clothing apps, thrift shops, neighbors, or friends. And I either still have this stuff or passed it on. In 2020, I attended UCSB as a first-year student. The school has a huge bike culture, so I didn’t have a car and used my bike as my primary mode of transportation. Biking became my choice mode of transportation, even when I returned home for holidays. I biked around my neighborhood, to friends’ houses, and to shopping malls. I stopped flying when it wasn’t necessary and started using public transportation or carpooling for farther distances. My friends began noticing my climate conscious habits and inquired about them. I explained their individual importance and additionally encouraged the people I knew to vote for representatives advocating for climate policies and environmental initiatives.  A group of us then started participating in climate activism on and off campus. 
                                      <br><br>

In the year 2020 the Democrats took back the White House. This brought on the decade of the Green New Deal. After years of knowledge about the climate crisis but little to no action against it, in fact the situation was worsening, we finally began fighting for our planet. Oil workers became planet healers, and for the same salary and benefits. Jobs were plentiful and more workers were actually needed. They worked to build more accessible highspeed public transportation, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by working collaboratively with ranchers, and to install renewable energy sources. The deal also included action that took advantage of the shift to a new system and new economy. Rather than maintaining or worsening inequality, the Green New Deal included Medicare for everyone and a federal jobs guarantee. We didn’t just make a dramatic shift in technological establishments, but in our culture. This movement for the environment was a movement for mankind. It increased individual happiness in so many ways. People had jobs and healthcare and everyday life was no longer destructive to our planet. As individuals we lived meaningful lives, and as a whole we did meaningful work. A carbon fee was also normalized in this decade. It deterred people and companies away from materials and practices that emitted carbon. So, while the Green New Deal worked to make infrastructure and national habits more climate conscious, the deal as well as the carbon fee also urged people to make climate conscious changes in their personal lives. These things together were strong enough to solve the climate crisis. Despite a few more natural disasters and some pushback from the Republican party, the world identified climate change as a crisis, and we came together to resolve it. 
                                      <br><br>

After I graduated from UCSB and through our nation’s, and other nations’, huge cultural shifts I continued environmentally friendly practices. I moved into co-housing after college and later moved into a city apartment with my husband and remained there later with our two children. It is now the year 2060. 2020 was a year in which the future was extremely uncertain. We were at risk of losing the ability to live on our planet, the ability for us and other species who inhabit the earth to survive here. But my generation saved the planet. A few laws and cultural changes sparked widespread personal change and we successfully got to the point we are at today.

<p>
In 2020, I became super aware of the Climate Crisis due to a class I took. Now, the year is 2060, but I will never forget the way I felt back then. I was terrified, saddened, pessimistic, enraged, inspired, and, in a way, awakened. The emotions were overwhelming and at times crippling. I didn't know if my own future was feasible, if we would be able to take the world back from greedy politicians and corporations. I was born in the year 2000 and my whole life, the U.S. has been pouring billions of dollars in military interests in the Middle East, and almost no money into domestic social services. I felt like apocalypse was impending, and nothing but a complete overhaul of the government system would prevent complete and total societal collapse. I felt ostracized and confused by the current system, and everyone my age seemed to be with me. Older generations didn't seem to care that the status quo was formed to exploit them, sell them garbage, and minimize their actual impacts on their community. It was a frustrating time. Nobody wanted to listen to young people.

                                      <br><br>

The election that year was disillusioning for most. Young people rallied around a promising candidate, but voter suppression and confusion tactics were everywhere. Voter turnout from younger demographics continued to be low, even though spirits were high to get the word out about voting. People are always scared of revolutionary action. What happened next terrified them.
                                      <br><br>


Mass protests, strikes, and takeovers began all over the U.S.. The people were demanding a more promising future, one where they could raise children without worrying about immanent climate catastrophe, and make a living wage to support their families. Social media exposed the mega - luxury that the wealthy was living in, and people started to understand the exploitation required for one person to collect a billion dollars. People began to demand equal compensation for their contribution to the company. Careers that were before frowned upon began to be celebrated, like custodians, field workers, and teachers. Since the movement was so widespread, it actually succeeded. Everyone was more aware of the working conditions behind their products. We began to value things for the ethical and practical value, instead of societal value. People continuing to buy from unfair practiced were shamed. Workers who harvested food and made clothes began to be some of the most respected and well paid members of society. 

                                      <br><br>

This mass change of the consumer mindset changed the marketplace significantly. Businesses that refused to change and adopt sustainable and ethical practices went out of business, while businesses that valued the well being of the environment and their workers flourished. The economy was booming, and most people saved money and spent it on long, adventurous trips instead of immediate manufactured gratification. Working hours were reduced, and in 2024, we elected a president who pushed green energy. The next five years were a time of incredible change in America. 
                                      <br><br>


Universal health care and fast, reliable public transportation were made available to everyone. The process of becoming a U.S. citizen was streamlined, and old housing was fixed up to accommodate both the migrant worker population and the homeless population. Unemployment, homelessness, and mental illness dropped nationwide. Indigenous Americans were given representation in government and able to protect what was left of their land, and reclaim more for restoration. Everyone benefited from this new world, even if they weren't willing to admit it.
                                      <br><br>


Finally, after coming of age in a world wrought with destruction, greed and chaos, I was able to live in a world where people looked out for each other. I wasn't scared of change, and neither were those around me. We had seen the good that change can bring. So, please, 2020, remember that change brings new light. Remember that we will not be oppressed: the people have more power than anyone can ever take away. The rest is all just constructed parts of society. They are not immune from collapse.

Heyo kids! I guess that first I should tell you what this is and why I’m writing it. I’m currently in the winter quarter of my 3rd year of undergrad at UCSB. I decided to take this class, Climate Crisis 101, because I’ve always loved the environment and wanted to learn about how climate change is affecting it. I learned... a lot. Climate change is caused by so many more factors than I thought and it affects so many more things than I thought. Hopefully, by the time you’re reading this, the world finally got its act together and started carrying out plans to help our planet and all the people on it. I feel, though, that I cannot talk badly about people ignoring the problem if I too didn’t do anything to try to stop it. While I don’t know what job I’ll have in the future, I will try my best to do work that is bettering the world. What career I have in the future is something that I can’t entirely plan, however, I can start changing my actions and lifestyle now, and that is what I intend to do. I’m going to use this letter to make a promise to myself and to you guys that I will think about others and the planet in all my actions. Below is a list of ways that I am going to change my lifestyle and how I think they look for us in the future. If this is what our lives look like when you’re reading this then yay! But if I never made any of these changes then yell at me!
                                      <br><br>


Food: At the beginning of this quarter I decided to go vegan, however, this class is the reason that I decided to instead become climatarian. I had been vegetarian several times when I was younger and had been vegetarian for a year before coming to college, so I already knew how bad the meat industry was for animals. There’s a lot of reasons why I then decided to go vegan. Laura and my parents had gone vegan so I felt like it was pretty easy after watching them, and I found myself just not eating a lot of dairy in the first place. Then earlier this year I watched a documentary on how much healthier vegan diets are and it pushed me to take the full jump into being vegan. Then I took this class and learned how horrible the meat industry is for the environment. I mean, there’s the same amount of green house gas emissions for 1 lb of beef as there are for 30 lbs of lentils!! 30!! That is just unjustifiable in my mind. But I also learned that your choices in veggies have impacts too, as eating asparagus in the winter is comparable in the amount of emissions to eating poultry. This information is what made me switch to a climatarian diet. In the future, I see you guys eating as climatarians as well, at least whenever I cook. I also see us eating locally a lot with frequent trips to the farmers market because I LOVE the farmers market!!

                                      <br><br>

Home: I don’t know where I picture myself living later and starting a family so I can’t really predict the location, but I hope to live in an apartment in small city after college. Once whoever your dad is and I start having kids we’ll probably move somewhere else, but definitely not into a big suburban home. I hope that our house is just as big as it needs to be and we don’t hoard a lot of stuff. College has made me a lot better about that, you don’t even want to see how much random stuff I had in my high school room. Right now I live in a house with 7 other people! They are all my best friends and I love it so much. I hope you guys get to meet them all someday. But this house is way too big for it to be meant for less people. Our family doesn’t need much space so I see us keeping it tiny in the future.

                                      <br><br>

Stuff: I use to buy so much random stuff. I would buy stuff at Target just because it was cheap, I would buy clothes without knowing how they were produced, and I would ship stuff from amazon right to my door. This class made me realize the weight of those actions. I’ve started thrifting for most of my stuff now and caring more about how things were made. After watching the documentary The True Cost and seeing how my purchases affect other people’s lives, I don’t think that I will ever be able to go back to my old habits surrounding stuff. I know that it can be hard when all your friends are getting the newest this and the newest that, but I hope that you guys understand why we won’t do that. 

                                      <br><br>

Activities: THE WORLD IS AMAZING! And also the world is dying. I want to see the beauties of the world before they are gone and I want you all to see them too. So I hope that we go on lots of camping trips, hikes, and visit lots of different places. However, we are going to do this as environmentally as we can. If there is an option that doesn’t include flying then we are going to take it. We’ll probably take the train a lot so get used to that one. I think that traveling and experiencing different places and cultures is important in discovering where you fit into it all, so I hope we do it as much as we can.
                                      <br><br>


I see my future with this lifestyle looking pretty good so I hope you like it too. I know that the world is already scary, and it’s hard for me to picture what it will be like when you’re reading this, but I hope that we did something about it. I hope that the planet has a bright future ahead of it. I hope that I played a part in marking the world a better place. I hope that you guys get to have the best experiences on this beautiful planet. Okay, that’s all that I’ll make you guys listen to for now. I love you guys and I can’t wait to meet you!!

The year is 2060 and climate change has wiped a lot out. It is our fault. We have known about the consequences of burning fossil fuels, depleting the oceans of fish, and raising cattle. Unfortunately, many people did not care about the future. They only cared for themselves and making money. Those people are no longer around and we are the ones alive and dealing with the problems they created.
                                      <br><br>

Back in 2020, we had a president who laughed at the idea of climate change and we also had many nonbelievers like him. Today everyone believes in climate change because we are living through it. Maybe if Donald Trump didn't somehow get elected again things would have been different. After Joe Biden won the primary, many people were upset and decided not to vote which allowed Trump to win. Trump did nothing to help lower our emissions. He allowed big corporations to keep dumping toxic waste and to release greenhouse gases.  Many people stuck to their diets of consuming meat and few people gave up using their cars. People continued on with their lives until it was too late. 
                                      <br><br>

The ice melted and the sea level rose. This caused the deaths of millions of people. People had to abandon their homes and flee to new places to find shelter. The people who couldn't find shelter died. The rising rising sea level also killed a massive amount of other species on the planet. Today very little biodiversity exists. The planet mainly consists of the surviving people and animals like cats, dogs, and livestock. It is very rare to find anything else. The planet is also a lot hotter. Every year people are killed by heat waves or hurricanes. Hurricanes are much more common now do it the warmer water. Unfortunately, they are also a lot stronger. We experience a lot of wildfires each year and in several locations, there are severe droughts. The high temperatures took out crops and many people passed away during the great famine. Another problem that was created when the ice melted was the release of new diseases. These diseases had never been seen before and we did not know how to combat them. They took the lives of many. 
                                      <br><br>

My biggest regret was not acting in 2020. I could have worked harder to communicate the climate crisis with others. I could have participated in more activism. I shouldn't have sat at home and waited for someone else to tackle the problem. I could have done something to help, but instead, I passed it off to someone else and now the world is ending.

In the year 2020, the largest imminent threat to the world was the climate crisis. The second, but seemingly more imminent to the public was the coronavirus. Due to the poor preparation and response to the pandemic, the United States of America was hit hard by the virus. Many Americans were not able to survive the disease and those that did were left with heavy medical and insurance expenses, not to mention a huge loss of income. This very unfortunate turn of events led to a social uprising, one that America had not seen in decades. In the 2020 presidential election, Bernie Sanders took the polls by storm, propelled by his promise of free universal health care for all, which began implementation as soon as Sanders took office. The Democrats also took the House and Senate, allowing for a more progressive future. With their newfound power, the Green New Deal was passed and America began to transition its energy production to renewables… slowly. Resistance was still strong from fossil fuel companies that did not want to give up their wealth. Leaders of the Renewable Movement, as it was now called, were threatened. But threats did not stop them. In 2023, major changes took hold. A bill was passed by the Democratic-controlled legislative branch, banning the extraction of fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas), forcing those companies into an ultimatum: start producing renewable energy sources or disband. Many of these companies started to develop their own solar panels and wind turbines, increasing competition in the market and lowering the prices of the products, furthering the progress of the Renewable Movement. Being one of the most powerful nations in the world, the example set by America was followed by some countries that had not yet already started to move towards more environmentally friendly policies.
                                      <br><br>

However, renewable energy technology would only go so far. A large number of American fossil fuels had been kept safely in the ground, but there were still sources of CO2 emissions at large. The construction of the solar panels that could be seen on an average American household had used fossil fuels. Many Americans still drove gasoline-burning cars as it was a cheaper option than buying a whole new car. And although oil extraction had been banned in America, there were still other sources of oil - the Middle East.
                                      <br><br>

In 2030, though the rate of CO2 emissions of the world had begun to plateau (ie. the rate was no longer rising), the global temperature had risen enough that it was almost unbearable to live in previously temperate areas and certain death to live in previously hot areas. The decrease in habitable regions led to the unfortunate, but inevitable, decrease in the number of inhabitants. Places all around the world were hit by the heatwave of death, but the most impactful was the Middle East - the source of the world’s oil. With no staff to man the oil pumps, gas prices skyrocketed around the world, forcing citizens to abandon their gasoline-guzzling automobiles. The response was a rise in electric cars and electric/hybrid bike sales. The old cars were recycled, many being converted into electric cars to be sold on the market. The world saw a gradual decrease in CO2 emissions and an increase in healthier citizens following the World Heat Wave of 2030.
                                      <br><br>

In 2032, a new world agreement was signed in Paris, and this time the US had committed to being a part of it. Drafting for the Paris Agreement of 2032 had begun immediately after the horrendous World Heat Wave of 2030. The agreement not only established guidelines for limiting each country’s per capita CO2 emissions but worked on a way for the world to pull the CO2 out of the air. The years 2032 to 2040 saw a large decrease in the amount of livestock and a large increase in budding forests. Millions of trees were restored to areas that had been previously cleared for fossil fuel extraction and livestock grazing. The price of meat, especially beef, increased to the point that many Americans began to explore other options: namely a plant-based diet. But this did not come without complaints and resistance. However, in time, especially with a more progressive upbringing, the new generation leading into the 2050s took to the plant-based diet quite fondly.
                                      <br><br>

Today, in 2060, there still remains many uninhabitable places on Earth. We still feel the effects of the peak of the climate crisis. There are places that are too hot to live in, there are cities underwater due to sea-level rise, hurricanes, and floods, and the diversity of the ocean has decreased drastically due to ocean acidification, to name a few. But it would be much, much worse had progress not begun in the 2020s. While the Earth is not perfect, while our situation would have been much better if action had been taken in the 1960s, the world is mending. Less and less CO2 is emitted every day. American citizens use renewable energy to power their homes, they use environmentally safer ways of transportation (electric bikes, electric cars, electric-powered public transportation), and are eating a largely plant-based diet. Earth has seen better days, yes, but hopefully, the best are yet to come.

  ‘Life moves pretty fast, if you don’t stop and look around once in a while you could miss it’. I believe it is 2060, you’re about to turn 60 and it genuinely feels like you were just living with 10 of your university buddies on 936 Camino Del Sur. It’s been quite the forty years. Lots of triumphs. Lots of losses. Lots of smiles. Lots of tears. Lots of memories. However, what has truly astronomically changed in the last 40 years is not so much yourself but rather everything around you. Before I digress and explain the last 40 years, I think it’s only fair I give you a little insight into what life in 2060 entails. Believe it or not, that very fantasy of a Tron Legacy-Esque lifestyle you always hoped and longed for is far from reality. However, what you will be pleased with is that the environment is currently in the best state it has ever been as the impossible was achieved! When you read the following details, I want you to smile because there were many times where you were convinced that we live in a horribly corrupt society. A society where cheating is justified based on the ethos of the ends justifying the means. However, that is far from the objective truth. Let this letter be a sign to you that resilience and hard work can go a long way. Whenever you feel like you’re not able to achieve something, think twice, think three times, just keep on thinking until you believe you can achieve the goal. 
                                      <br><br>

Firstly, I would like to digress back to the winter quarter of your sophomore year at UCSB. English 23. You had taken English 22 with Ken Hiltner in your fall year but there was something so compelling about Ken Hiltner that you decided to take English 23. What a great decision that was. In the class, you truly first learn about what is going on around you. Having grown up in Dubai you were in a bubble that prevented you from knowing a lot of what was going on around you, however, Ken truly widened the narrative lens of society and truly prompted you to change. In this class, week in and week out you were informed of the many detriments us humans were contributing to the environment. Your knowledge of the climate crisis exponentially grows at such a fast rate that there’s a point in time where you consider switching your major to environmental studies.  Irrespective of that, English 23 proves to be the very class that you see materialize over the next 20 years. For instance, carbon taxation has grown to be a universal norm. Corporate giants start to really reduce their carbon emissions and the cap and trade policy has been so successful that every country has implemented a similar structure. 
                                      <br><br>

Beyond this, you’ll read an article by David Wallace Wells who many proclaimed to be an alarmist and a defeatist. However, no one realized that Wallace Wells was the man who instigated the climate crisis revolution. He may have said that Bangladesh would be completely underwater by 2040 or that Indonesia would be in a very similar situation. He may have stated that if action is prompted too soon it would be too late. Neither of which has happened. However, much of what David Wallace Wells writes about is what is needed for humans to snap into reality. Many of the general population live on the premise of short-term gain and long-term pain rather than short-term pain and long-term pain. Wallace Wells moves many in the latter direction. 
                                      <br><br>

Now towards the end of your winter quarter, something extraordinary occurs. The COVID-19 pandemic. This may be a very daunting period of time for many, however, it is merely another wake-up call. The holes in many government health systems are witnessed. The panic of the globe brings many together. Although you spend the rest of your sophomore year back home in Dubai, a lot of thinking is conducted. Pondering about your current lifestyle and current life goals. This is when you decide to cut down on your consumerist lifestyle. Limiting yourself to two pairs of shoes, six t-shirts, and four pants. As someone who was such a streetwear enthusiast, this is huge. Beyond this, I imagine similar thinking processes occur with many as the entire globe’s lifestyle alters. In one of the lectures, you watch a short documentary on how Copenhagen has successfully implemented a city-wide bike-friendly ethos, this is the future. Everyone rides on bikes, whether it be carbon-free emission electric bikes or regular bicycles like what many rode in Isla Vista! Change has finally initiated at this stage and the climate crisis saga is slowly coming to an end. 
                                      <br><br>

Towards the end of the ’40s, you’ll start to see most with plant-based diets, environmentally friendly clothing and greener lifestyles. This is to say that change is very possible, and it starts with the small things. I urge you and everyone in this time period to initiate the little things. These little things will go so far. Don’t give up and as the opening of this letter, the most important thing is to enjoy your life. ‘Life moves pretty fast, if you don’t stop and look around once in a while you could miss it’

Dear Future Self:
                                      <br><br>


On March 9 of 2020 you were pessimistic. You couldn’t foresee the United States making the changes it needed to help save the planet. Yet, a few gloomy months later Bernie Sander was elected as President. With the evil Trump out of office, change was on the way. A new Green New Deal was signed. This one was actually taken into action. Eating meat became obsolete. People began to realize the fate our planet was headed for and finally made a change. Everyone owned a bike. Having a car was no longer a fad everyone wanted to be a part of. Thrifting became the only way to buy clothes, as after Forever 21 collapsed so many other clothing companies went out of business. Bernie also made college free. Without all this unnecessary money being spent on something that should’ve been free in the first place, people were able to work less and focus more on doing meaningful activities and having personal connections that truly matter. 
                                      <br><br>


The year is now 2060, congratulations that you have made it to this age. When you were 20 you still ate dairy products, drove a car, and online shopped. Now that all of these disastrous habits are out of your way, you live a much more meaningful and happy life. Minimalism became the lifestyle everyone adopted. The world became more focused on trade and equality, rather than superiority and consumerism. Carbon taxes were implemented so big corporations could no longer mass create everything and had to take the planet into consideration. 
                                      <br><br>


Along with Bernie’s election that helped implement change, there was a mass fire in California which really pulled our heads out of our… well for lack of a better word, asses. With this fire came a fresh start to rebuilding an industry that emitted less. Women became educated and access to birth control was easy to come by. This made the population drastically shrink and we no longer had to be crowded and the earth became a more open environment. 
                                      <br><br>
I’m glad you took the time to read this message from your younger self, and you should be glad to know how much the world has changed. Hope you’re doing well living a happier and healthier lifestyle.

I love your letter to your future self. This is so interesting to read and reflect a lot. I love your point about the fall of fast fashion companies like Forever 21. And the part about Trump got kicked out? Amazing! It’s really a relief to hear all these. When I think about the future in the past, before getting into college, it’s all grey, grey sky, grey ocean and grey ground - grey everywhere. And I barely know a thing about regulations like the Green New Deal. I was quite depressed sometimes actually. But after joining this class and watching so many informative videos about the climate crisis and ways to solve the issues, I start to feel optimistic. Although currently there aren’t many policies that actually put into force, it’s getting better.

For myself, I’m decreasing the portion of meat in my diet. I eat more vegetarian based food now and less beef, and I also reduce the food waste of every meal, basically zero now. This actually makes me happier, especially when I finish all my food in the plate with a fulfilled stomach. Sometimes I would think about countries like Iraq or India, where many people are still in hunger. I think the US should really do something to help them, or help the world. There are so many surpluses in the US, and all those food waste? People need to get more education on the climate crisis and how to act on it, or they will just continue what the 1960s people have been doing for several centuries, exploit, exploit and EXPLOIT!

I would have to say that forty years ago is when the world truly began to slip into oblivion. You couldn’t take ten steps without the ground erupting in flames beneath your feet, politics were as divided as the Marianas Trench, and this is all not to mention the global pandemonium surrounding the announcement of a pandemic: the infamous coronavirus. It’s said that every generation has their one global disaster, and lucky for mine it was five in the span of twelve months. We saw the signs before and after, the connections these tragedies had with the rising temperature and humanity’s selfishness of the natural resources meant to be distributed between all earth’s habitants. The 20’s were our last chance at making a change, and I think we kicked off the decade with about as serious of a wake-up call as is plausible. How would we react?
                                      <br><br>

A pandemic does have one upside: a common battle. At the start of the outbreak, everyone was calling for complete isolation; we were more in the dark than ever before. However, as more research was making waves, nations began to feel the comfort of safety just above the horizon, finally able to open their doors again. This motivation and tangible vaccine actually contributed to some sort of union around the world. There was a point in which our actions were motivated by more than just our nation, but rather the well being of the human race. Shipments of vaccines were being driven around the globe and people were being saved. They always say we’ll never get along until we fight a common enemy, and this was our evil alien.
                                      <br><br>

Climate scientists knew a pandemic was likely should we continue to ignore the rising temperatures. David Wallace Wells spoke of such a matter in his papers, and yet he was disregarded as being an alarmist. History has a way with spiteful irony. That being said, this was a push to make a change. Even if it might not have directly associated with the climate crisis, it’s hard to ignore that it’s yet another global matter that’s occurred since the dramatically risen temperatures. There were still massive fires taking place, such as those in Australia and those occurring in rapid succession each new year. We couldn’t keep living this way. With that moderate union, however, we were starting to be able to see common ground between nations, and begin to enact policies that would call for lower gas emissions, far safer working conditions, for public healthcare, for better care of the earth. This pandemic taught us ways in which to handle other massive crises, such as, you guessed it, the one on climate.
                                      <br><br>

A carbon tax was passed, which deterred people from driving as often. Public transportation became so much more viable and I witnessed a great decrease in people moving into the countryside. People got into growing their own food and making their own DIY creations as opposed to feeding into the corporate machine. There were new innovations being made daily, and it was so amazing to witness people actually caring about one another and the wellness of the world. The question is: was it enough?
                                      <br><br>

Well, I guess something can be said for me being able to transcribe these words today, but to be completely honest, I don’t believe we did enough. I’m so proud of what this stubborn species did accomplish in a crumbling world, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think we completed the task. It’s hard knowing that the hills don’t roll like they used to. It’s hard knowing the cliffs are crumbling and that Florida is underwater. I still wonder what it would have been like to see a glacier or explore the landscapes of Greenland. I grieve for the extinction of so many beautiful creatures and I wish I could have seen more of the world. Yes, it isn’t over, but it isn’t what it once was either. Something was better than nothing at all, but will it ever be enough? Only time will tell.

I know things seem bleak right now. To be honest, it will get a little worse. A series of natural disasters including massive hurricanes, devastating wildfires, and extreme droughts will continue wreaking havoc worldwide for the next few years. However, the massive loss of life and land does cause people to realize the impact of the climate crisis and spur them to action. People angry with the inaction of their politicians vote in a new wave of young, conscientious, and driven lawmakers in countries around the world to try to fight back against the climate crisis. In the United States, the Green New Deal is passed in 2024 after progressives take control of the House, Senate, and Presidency. Passing this bill ushers in a new era of renewable energy, reduced emissions, restored ecosystems, improved transportation, and sustainable food. Some people were indeed hurt by the effects of the Green New Deal, but they were also greatly helped by the socioeconomic justice that is a foundation of the Green New Deal. Universal healthcare and a federal job guarantee were a huge help. It did take about a decade, but by 2034 the nation had mobilized to greatly reduce emissions and help fight against the negative effects of the climate crisis.

                                      <br><br>

There are also worldwide effects of this rise in climate progressivism. A second Paris Climate Accord was written and passed by all major countries worldwide, but this time it was strongly enforced because people worldwide recognized what a crisis the entire planet faced. There was also a clause where the amount of harm each country contributed to the climate crisis was calculated, and those that contributed the most were charged with helping the countries that were hurt the most to recover. Progress was slow, and there were some missteps along the way, but overall the entire world was unified in its goal to save the planet. By 2060 we are almost entirely relying on renewable energy and have greatly reduced carbon emission levels to manageable levels. By now we have seen some of the disastrous effects of the climate crisis, and these consequences are much less serious. The number of hurricanes, fires, floods, droughts, and other climate disasters is greatly reduced and those that were affected have gotten the help that they need.
                                      <br><br>


I know that right now you can feel kind of hopeless. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done before we reach 2060, and a lot of people that need to be convinced about the seriousness of the crisis. It will be hard and there will be setbacks. However, it is largely due to a large youth movement led by people like you that helped bring about such important change. Climate marches throughout the world lead to a large increase in public transportation systems, causing the number of flights to greatly decrease. A carbon tax leads to people reducing the amount of meat in their diet, buying less stuff, and choosing to live in a more eco-friendly way. Individual action does make a huge difference and help bring about this change. Voting is the most important thing as it is the wave of progressives that inspires so much legal change. But other actions such as participating in marches, choosing to use more eco-friendly modes of transportation, and switching to a plant-based diet inspire the community of every individual who does this. The popularity of these actions grows, and the old society that prioritized cars and stuff and giant mansions slowly fades away. Pretty soon the entire world is used to living in an eco-friendly way, and this has only made people happier because they know they are helping their planet.

The year is 2060 and life on earth is becoming increasingly hard to support. Cities are becoming overpopulated, food is scarce, and life is just overall less comfortable than it used to be. We are currently in the 6th mass extinction. 
                                      <br><br>

Over a century ago, our country experienced the industrial revolution and life began to flourish. During this time period people developed habits that at the time seemed to be only beneficial when really these habits later turned out to be detrimental. The generation that lived during this time built a culture that was centered on consumption and this culture was passed onto future generations. Life became more and more about consumption as time moved on. This trend continued until success was based on material wealth. Life became centered on trying to have the most stuff. People were spending all of their time working just to buy fancy cars, big homes, and new clothes everyday. 
                                      <br><br>

About 80 years ago when my parents were nearly twenty years old, people started to realize that there were major implications of their lifestyle choices. It started to become apparent that the society we formed was built on environmental destruction and that in the long run life could not be sustained by living like this. It was during this generation that people had the choice to start making a difference. If society could begin to transform to more sustainable practices then in the future the earth could thrive. So did this generation make these necessary changes? Obviously if you look around you can see the answer is no. However, It is important to also acknowledge that this generation did not see disasters happening in front of them. That is because the consequences of these actions took decades to begin happening. As a result, we can not put the blame entirely on this generation. 
                                      <br><br>

A Lot of the blame for what today's world has become should fall on my generation and rightfully so. 
                                      <br><br>
Although we were set up for failure by the generation before us and although the climate crisis was already happening in front of our eyes, we had the chance to stop it from progressing. We had the chance to make a change. In no way am I saying it would have been easy for us to do it, in fact, it would have been extremely hard to pull off, but If we all came together with one goal, to correct the mistakes of the past generation and start forth on a new sustainable pathway, we could have accomplished it. Instead we failed to act. Now the children of the generation after mine have to pay the price and suffer for something they had nothing to do with. 
                                      <br><br>

Instead of making a change we followed the same path that the generation before us created. We saw what was happening but we failed to act because we didnt take it seriously enough. We knew that the consequences were coming but we thought that we would be able to continue living the way we did for at least a little bit longer. We wanted more proof. We waited for these disastrous  consequences to begin happening and when they did that's when we finally decided to make changes. But it was too late. 
                                      <br><br>

As a generation we should have tackled this problem both individually and as one large community. Each person should have began to live more sustainably, eating a plant-based diet, cutting out fossil fuel use (especially plane flights), and overall just consuming less. As a generation we should have voted more and voted for policies and people that supported creating sustainable life. We should have become local activists in each of our own communities and forced our local governments to make changes because these changes would have radiated all the way up the ladder. But as a whole we failed to make these changes. 
                                      <br><br>

I am not saying we didn't put up a fight. Some of us definitely tried to make a difference. Lots of people made changes in their lives. People stopped flying, driving, eating meat, and purchasing lots of goods. Lots of us began to live minimalist lives. But this wasn't enough. Large fossil fuel corporations kept pumping oil, fracking, and producing huge amounts of emissions. In addition, the arrogant failed to make changes and continued to deny the science and tell others that its all a hoax.
                                      <br><br>

But now it is 2060 and human life is in danger. Dangerous catastrophes are no longer rare, in fact, they are very common. People no longer live along the coast line and cities have been fully abandoned. People have started to make changes but it is much too late. Although these changes will help stop the problem from getting any worse, it is far past the crucial time to make these changes. People are finally starting to get why it was so important to make these changes 40 years ago. We failed and the children today will never understand what it was like to live in what was once such a beautiful world. 
                                      <br><br>

If theres one thing I have to say it is that Im sorry that my generation didn't make a bigger difference.

A message from the future:
                                      <br><br>




The year is 2060 and the world has changed a lot. In 2020, billions of people were wiped out by coronavirus and now our population is still on average very young…. survival of the fittest. We are working to rebuild all the infrastructure and knowledge we lost with losing the old and a lot of the very young. To be completely honest though, a huge epidemic like C-VID was needed to allow us to start from scratch and to even out our populations to healthy levels because in 2020 we were overcrowding our planet, causing ecosystems to die and promoting the spread of disease. 
                                      <br><br>

We no longer have the old, typical coastal areas in the United States, and a majority of island nations are also underwater. Central America has rebuilt and is becoming crowded and consequently we now live in micro-apartments because there is no longer space for individual homes due to mass migration away from coastal areas. The diets of Americans is still difficult to change - we still provide meat and dairy becuase there were extreme riots about abolishing these types of farms and consequently we are still emitting a huge amount of methane. A lot of people also still have cars which crowd streets and while they are mostly electric vehicles, still contribute a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. 
                                      <br><br>

We have now revamped cities and workplaces so that everything we need is within close proximity - a bike ride, a walk, or a bus ride. This has helped a lot with reducing emissions - by bringing everything you could need closer. We still have airports, they are still used a lot, and I don’t think they will ever go out of business. We will always need to travel to different continents and people should be able to travel to visit families in other places. There is a lot of lobbying to make flights a lot more expensive but a lot of backlash surrounds this argument as for a lot of people, international travel is a necessity and it unfairly affects these people more than others. 
                                      <br><br>

While we still have a lot of environmentally unfriendly activities to change, we have started the response to the immediate climate issues we have already had to face. These climate challenges will continue to hit us hard and fast, however, since we decided to refuse to take preventitive measures until it was too late. I hope that moving forward we can become proactive and reform the political system so these changes can be made more fluidly, but there is hope in the new generation that will be taught belief in climate change and our power as humans to save the planet - no more denial. 
                                      <br><br>

These are the steps we have taken, we have a long road but I hope we can make bigger, better change to stop a truly disasterous ending.

I’m writing this letter to be put into a time capsule, it should be buried at Campus Point and opened in the year of 2060. Dear future self, so this year as I scrolled through GOLD  searched for any classes that would cover GE”s. I was frustrated at this point, because you know how hard it is to get into classes. I came across a course called English 23: The Climate Crisis, there were several empty spots so I decided to add it to my schedule. I went to class the first day, and was immediately shocked to learn that all of the course material would be accessible for anyone online. English 23 was my first introduction to climate change. Of course I’ve heard of the issue and seen people discuss it over the media, I knew who Greta Thunberg was and a little bit about carbon footprints. However, I would have called myself very uneducated and unaware of the urgency and impact of climate change. After week one’s reading and film I was instantly concerned for our future. I was eager to learn what I could do to save our planet. Week after week I watched documentaries, read profunf readings, and listened to what my peers had to say about the issue. 
                                      <br><br>

I learned that there was a lot to be done, and that I could change my lifestyle. After learning about how much greenhouse gases are emitted from agriculture alone, I made it a point to become vegan. While some days are harder than others I think that reducing my carbon footprint is worth it. My family had also made it a priority to consume less meat. I found myself driving to places that were super close instead of biking, so I made the decision to leave my car back in my hometown. I began to bike to work, and bussing downtown or to the grocery store when necessary. When I can, I take the train ride home instead of having someone pick me up. I also try to educate as many people as possible on the matter. 
                                      <br><br>

 I have learned a lot this year and I plan on continuing to expand my knowledge, and continuing to find my voice as a climate activist. I am proud of the changes I have made in order to reduce my climate footprint, and I know there is still a lot more to do. The next time I open this letter I will be 60 years old which seems almost unimaginable. I hope that our generation was able to make a change and I hope we are still doing so forty years from now as well. I hope that I am still reducing my footprint and using my voice to educate others and fight for what is right. Thanks Ken for lifting us up and teaching us how to fight this battle.

Dear future self,
                                      <br><br>

I am writing this to you in the year 2020. We are not even 1/4th done with the year and so much has already happened. “2020 is the year,” everyone said, but sadly we had a rocky start. The beginning of 2020 has taught me so much, as you will remember we took a climate crisis class in our second year of college. I am hoping you stuck to your climatarian diet even if the Earth is fine now I hope you are still doing your part. I also expect you are still in love with nature and surrounding yourself with it. To think years ago we were scared Earth would be gone. 
                                      <br><br>

You are 60 years old and have seen your niece(s and hopefully nephews) grow up into remarkable people. Just like our generation made moves to create a better future I am sure they and the next generation did the same. In 2020 a climate crisis class was one you took if you were interested, but hopefully by 2060 it is a requirement. It is so important to teach people how important earth and nature are. 
                                      <br><br>

Everyone here is wondering what this time period will go down like in history books and hopefully it is still serving as a reminder in 2060 how important it is to go out and vote. I hope you are continuing to show up at polls and are encouraging family and friends to vote. Although I hope by 2060 everyone find pleasure and importance in voting. 
                                      <br><br>

You have a lot of spark and optimism at almost 19 years old and I hope you still continue being that way. I hope you are buying from more sustainable brands (or maybe designing your own?). Whatever you are doing in your career I hope it is to make the world a better place for future generations. I hope that there is no longer any fear about what to do about the climate crisis because I aspect our generation and the next to have taken the steps to provide a sustainable home for our family and friends. 
                                      <br><br>

You are currently not going out of your comfort zone to be more sustainable. You are doing personal changes, but I wish you were more involved and outgoing in spreading awareness. I hope you are more fearless even if it is at 60, I hope you are advocating for the earth, animals, and people that are not allowed a voice. I hope you are doing so much for the environment and surrounding yourself with people that care about the earth. 
                                      <br><br>

I hope this finds you well.

The year is 2040. I am forty years old, married, with two kids. They are about the same age I was when I first learned to scuba dive. We’re in the Caribbean visiting my parents who retired and followed their dreams to buy a catamaran to live on and sail around the world until they can’t anymore. I taught my husband how to sail back in college and chartering boats has become our family’s favorite vacation. I’ve been diving here since I was 12, and I can attest firsthand to how much the marine life has faded. It used to be that no matter what dive site you picked, you would be surrounded by colorful corals and so many fish and sea turtles you’d often bump into them. Even when I took that climate crisis class back in college, I had begun to notice that there seemed to be less and less life with each dive. Now, forty years later and little done to mitigate warming, seeing much more than a couple fish is a treat. I always doubted that our people could come together to advocate for sweeping climate-resolving policy because of the drastic (often perceived undesirable) effect it would have on people’s lives. People are afraid of change, and thus only a select few with actively run towards it.
                                      <br><br>
The year is 2060. It took a massive earthquake- so large it broke any currently existing scale- wiping out most of California and sending tsunamis towards many other countries to finally result in action. Over the years so many people have died for the crisis we easily could have avoided, but it took fear of death to overcome the aforementioned fear of lifestyle change. Now we have put in place policies cutting our emissions to almost zero and placing strong regulations on companies’ doings on the environment. It wasn’t pretty- we fell into an economic crisis as jobs were lost and transformed to clean energy, but we pulled through and one by one more countries began to follow suit. In many underdeveloped regions, war broke out as mass migrations and weather disasters occurred. Eventually, by sheer number, women gained power alongside their male counterparts and advocated to improve girl’s education and access to reproductive health care. We are all still feeling the catastrophic effects of the warmings and the world remains far from perfect, but as time goes on we are returning to peace.

I’m currently writing this at the computer desk at our little duplex on 66 Pasado, remember the one where the cat kept getting stuck in the tree?? Anyways, the current state of the world is kinda shitty, climates are varying away from used to be “normal”, COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on grocery stores and leaving the general public in a state of panic. In recent years, Trump left a major setback on our environmental protection. However there is hope with the new 2020 election if Bernie Sanders becomes president as he CAN make a change for our world but it is still unsure. For now, no one can tell who will win this year’s election, but I pray it’s Bernie because he seems like the only candidate who is WILLING to make a change for the future. I hate seeing the world suffer because of the ignorance from not only the POTUS, but also the corporate elites and their greed for profit. because of the little importance it has based on our current president. This year is pretty shitty and I really hope things change.
                                       <br><br>

I hope by 2060 that new laws are enacted and corporate greed is regulated to serve the people and the world. I hope endangered species get a CHANGE to repopulate and become abundant again. I hope you, your kids, and your grandkids can experience a world without hate, ignorance, and high amounts of materialism. I hope Bernie can make a difference where our children will no longer have to make a change to fix our problems, but make a change to progress past that.

<p>
The year is 2060 and I am sorry to the younger generations who have to deal with the inactions of my and previous generations. We have failed the human species by not taking immediate action when we knew that global warming was anthropogenic. We have known about the consequences to the environment for decades and yet people stood by and did nothing. This is mostly because politicians and big oil companies knew and instead of trying to alleviate the consequences they continued fracking and spent money to create doubt among Americas. We had some potential in 2020 when Bernie Sanders was running for president and even though he was popular in California, other people were unable to see the vision and were afraid of change. People called him a socialist because he was not afraid to call out how harmful capitalism is. Capitalism not only harms people because it creates immense economic inequality but it is killing the environment. Capitalism is about getting the world to consume so that billionaires are able to make even more money without consideration of the planet or the people along the way. Bernie was endorsing the Green New Deal which was a step in the right direction, and had a plan set up for Americans. It outlined the steps that we should be taking to combat global warming and bring down the emissions we are emitting into the Earth. But of course, people were afraid of change and wanted things to stay the same. People endorsed Joe Bidden as the democratic nominee, even though their ideologies did not align with his and he had no plan for the environment. They believed that he was the candidate to beat Trump, although his policies and ideas were not what the American people needed. We needed a leader who looked out for the general public and not just the people at the top; which is how it has always been. We have slowly made changes, as we were forced to by the harsh climate and natural disasters that have become more common, but we had the resources and the intelligence to take immediate action a long time ago and still we are not where we should be. Other countries on the other hand knew that the world did not have any time to wait for us to realize that we had to do something. Other countries made changes to their lifestyle and luckily did not take after Americans destructive behavior.
                                       <br><br>
In 2020 when I took the course climate crisis 101, as a senior in undergraduate school I learned so much and it forced me to look at the actions I take to reduce my own emissions. Since I have learned about the destruction that Americans have had on the world I have become more conscious about what I do and what I eat. I changed my eating habits and although I did not completely eliminate meat, I made changes slowly. I limited my intake of meat and tried giving up beef completely. I try to walk and bike places that are near and I’ve also become interested in gardening. I no longer buy things that I do not need and have limited my spending to necessities. I shop at thrifts to not encourage companies from producing more clothing and I try not to use a heater and instead rely on blankets and clothing for heating.





</p><hr>



<p>
I’m sorry that I am unable to be optimistic about the climate crisis that we face, and that I do not think Americans will be able to enact the change necessary to begin to resolve what I think is the greatest issue, not only now to face humankind and the natural world, but in all of human history. That does not mean that I won’t, and that we won’t try, but the forces acting against rapid progress are far too great in the United States, and the swift change that people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders want to enact. I am pessimistic that Americans will be willing to self-impose such restrictions that are necessary to curb more emissions and invest in adaptation infrastructure to the extent that is mandatory. We, as American people, do not near unanimously “believe” in climate science, let alone desire to adapt to and mitigate climate change. Our government does not see it as a priority, and neither do most of our people – therefore we will do nothing of great significance about it. I think that the only way we will see implementation of better policy, and taxation, is through systemic change that we are unwilling to make. We are far too entrenched in the status quo and our system is intrinsically undemocratic, exclusionary, and uneducated. I hope that I will be able to look back in 40 years, when I am 58, and say that I think we have made progress in leaps and bounds, and have drastically mitigated emissions, as well as prepared ourselves for the damage we have already caused, but I think so lowly of the American government, system, and people, that I cannot imagine a situation in which I would be near satisfied, let alone happy and encouraged. I hate to leave this course in such a negative way, but I cannot see any alternative. We spent the last ten weeks discussing what each of us can do about climate change, and in reality, unless we undertake massive system transformation – that will not happen – we cannot do anything to affect the system on a big level. We mist put a high price on carbon, we must tax animal products, we must invest in a high quality rapid public transportation system, we must invest in a healthcare system for all, we must strive to make our population as educated as we possibly can - but we are not going to do any of these things under any system I can see realistically being implemented. So, with a pessimistic mind and a disheartened attitude, I conclude this course, wanting to be wrong, and wanting to make my life relevant and useful for solving the greatest issue of our kind and our generation.

During the late 1930s and onwards into the ‘40s, the free world was facing a dire threat to its way of life in the form of Nazi Germany. As Hitler and the fascits rose to power, democracy was undermined, enormous, unjust suffering was induced, and violent conflict was becoming inevitable. Americans, some antisimetic, others ignorant, others still supporting isolationist policies, were slow to take action. Only when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, causing death and destruction on American soil, did the nation go to war. I use the word “nation” in its broadest form, for both soldiers and civilians alike did their part for the war effort. The country rationed its precious resources so the troops could be fed, converted their comercial factories into weapon production facilities, and bought war bonds with what little money they could spare. Women joined the workforce, factories were desegregated, and a sense of unity swept over the country - all because of the common enemy people had in Hitler and the Nazis. I do not mean to gloss over the atrocities committed in the name of war. Let us not forget our own government ripped Japanese Americans from their home and forced them into a concentration camp. I intend, only, to point out the victory America experienced in WW2 led to a national sense of optimism and hope in the following decades. These were decades that saw real progress in the feminist and civil rights movements, a booming middle class, and strong trust in our institutions . 
                                       <br><br>
This is, roughly, what happened about a century later as well. Only this time, the enemy was climate change. People rallied behind truly democratic leaders, mobilized, gave up certain luxuries like cars and big fancy houses. We used climate change to reshape our democracy and the way it functioned. We decreased the level of income inequality, pushed for minority rights in the environmental and societal sphere, and brought young voices to the decision table. 
                                       <br><br>

In doing so, we made a more just world. Just as America saw a booming economy and middle class in the 1950’s, we saw a stabilized economy and happy society in the 2050’s. In enabling the youth to take control on climate change, we gave them a voice with other issues, such as economic rights like health care and education. Just as the need for African American soldiers and workers in World War 2 lead to the civil rights movement, pursuits for environmental justice across the globe made America look internally at it’s own race relations. Just as technology became revered for its  role in the war against the Nazi’s, science and education became highly valued things during and after its role in the war against climate change. One of the greatest things the war on climate change brought was an end to big money in politics. After people saw just how devious and manipulative big oil had been in our government, they realized things like that should no longer be allowed to happen. This in turn had enormous ripple effects on gun violence, animal rights, privacy laws, etc. The people now had a voice.
                                       <br><br>

Beyond the specifics, the relief felt at the end of both wars fostered an optimistic culture, one in which people felt they could again work together to change things. This to me had immeasurable value.
                                       <br><br>

Why did we do this? We did this because, just like in the 1930s, we realized what we were protecting, and what we could accomplish, was so much more valuable than the vices we were sacrificing. We stood up for equality, for democracy, for basic human rights, for responsibility, sustainability, and love of planet and people and living things. In the end, we all knew it was worth it.

Dear grandkid, You just got into college majoring in Environmental Studies. This reminds me of the time when I became aware of the climate crisis and became a climatarian. It was 2020 and I took an english class about the climate crisis for a GE. However this class really impacted how I lived my life. At that time the climate crisis was at its worst. People were travelling, wasting food, and owning huge amounts of land but when the president decided to adopt the Green New Deal everything changed. Slowly but surely we were able to help mitigate the climate crisis. It was hard in the beginning but once we got the ball rolling it was easy. We were able to save the coral reefs which were projected to be extinct by the year 2050. Fracking became illegal and people invested more time and money on renewable energy. They placed a carbon tax on flying, that is why it is so expensive. I am glad you are helping the climate crisis situation. 
                                       <br><br>
Have you not wondered why I always take a train to visit you guys or why I grow my own garden. Taking that class made me want to help mitigate the climate crisis and it fills me with joy that you have decided to continue helping mitigate the climate crisis. Let me tell you how I helped, I graduated UCSB with a bachelors in electrical engineering, an engineer is someone who helps solve problems. I decided with my knowledge that I will invest my time in making renewable energy more accessible. I mainly focused on solar panels. Mostly all of the solar panels you see on the roofs of buildings used my design of a solar panel that generated a great amount of energy without producing any greenhouse gases. This did not help eliminate the climate crisis but that did not discourage me. I always and till this date try to help our lovely planet. Now you understand why I get upset when food gets wasted. Wasting food is one of the biggest ways to help contribute to the climate crisis. But I am not going to be here for too long so I hope you can fill in my shoes to become a climatarian. 
                                       <br><br>
Now that my time is passed for this generation it is up to you to help keep the climate crisis in control. One of the biggest things you can do is vote for representatives who support the mitigation of the climate crisis, that's how we were able to pass the Green New Deal in 2020. Having government officials who are aware of the state of our planet is critical in keeping the planet habitable. Make sure they are willing to fight for it. I am pretty sure you will learn a lot about the past 40 years in your classes, but do not let the bad part of history repeat itself. Our generation was able to learn from the past to make changes but it is up to your generation to help keep those changes that protect our environment. I am content with how this generation is helping mitigate the climate crisis but you guys can not stop. The generation before mine really messed up our planet. But I believe that in your lifetime the climate crisis would be gone. And I hope it is.

It’s 2060 and the world is ending. Looking back to the 2020’s, it was all such a dream. There were no climate refugees, Miami still existed, and nature was filled with a wide range of wild animals. But rapidly, the state of life deteriorated for everyone, especially for the poorest nations. Up until 2040, major politicians and oil companies still denied the existence of climate change. They insisted the huge hurricanes, and the icebergs completely disappearing were just normal, and a regular cycle earth goes through. And the public believed it. Through their endless campaigning and trillions of dollars spent, Americans continued on their quest for the American Dream and endless consumerism. 
                                       <br><br>

Greta Thunberg and the Green New Deal were swept to the side to continue the lifestyle of waste and convenience that we were born to crave. Activists and people who cared tried to make a change. They tried to make the honest information heard, but their voices were stomped on by the people making endless amounts of cash and held endless amounts of power. Millions of individuals adjusted their lifestyles to make it more environmentally friendly - leaving fast fashion and converting to veganism- but it wasn’t everyone, and that just wasn't enough. Now, we all have to suffer the consequences. There is no hope for the next generation, with the earth completely overpopulated and drained of resources. People have started to lose hope, yet still try to imitate the lives we used to live back then.
                                       <br><br>

 But in 2020, there was still hope. There was hope that the Green New Deal would be passed through congress and that America would rejoin the Paris Agreement. There was hope that technological advancements ,like carbon capture, would save us all and reverse the damage done to our earth. There was still hope because people still cared. 
                                       <br><br>

But the opinions and actions of people who cared were stifled by these massive corporations, who now, are under massive blame. But even though we all know the truth now, it is too late. The earth is ruined, there is no hope. 

</p><hr>



<p>
It is the year 2060, and 40 years ago the world was very different. The world was facing a global pandemic, the wealth gap in America was the largest it had been in decades, and our world was dying. Unfortunately, in that year the US got hit hard by the famous COVID-19 and many died. Everyone blamed the President Trump for not being as prepared as we should have been, and that year he was voted out of office. Trump, a conservative, had given big companies tax cuts and increased the uses of fossil fuels despite the overwhelming evidence that our planet was warming at alarming rates. He even coined the term “clean coal”, as if burning coal did not release carbon dioxide into the air. That election year, a whole new type of demographic took control of the Senate and we put a progressive into the White House. This was the kick start that the US needed to create some change for the better. In fact, what resulted were some of the largest changes since Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal almost 90 years prior. A series of bills were passes, coined the Green New Deal that completely changed how not only we dealt with climate change, but how we dealt with the entire US economy. 
                                       <br><br>


From the 1950’s until the 2020’s, the US economy was based on consumerism. People worked over 40 possibly even 60 plus hours a week to be able to buy things they did not need. As you can imagine, this was not only detrimental to our environment, as creating all these goods emitted a lot of fossil fuels, but it made people extremely unhappy. All they did was eat, sleep, and work. There was no time for any free time, for family, friends, things that would help alleviate stress. They suffered this so they could buy the latest “Margaritaville” (for those of you who don’t now that’s a South Park reference, a show from that time. Do people even drink margaritas anymore?). That’s beside the point, people were working hours they did not need to, to buy things that were unnecessary to survive. And boy was there excess at that time, houses were on average 2 times larger than they are now and people had about twice the amount of money. That may sound great, but to facilitate this fossil fuels were released at enormously high rates, and we were single handedly killing our planet. 
                                       <br><br>


So, what did we do? The Green New Deal created a concept called a carbon tax, where anything that required carbon, or released carbon into the atmosphere got taxed. As years went by, this tax slowly increased, until a gallon of gas which costed $3.50 per gallon in California costed around $15 per gallon. To put that into perspective, cars of the time held around 20 gallons of fuel, so a standard fill-up went from costing $70 to costing $300. This made having a car extremely expensive, and slowly the use of these cars lessened. This tax, I shouldn’t call a tax it was a fee, so all the money collected by the government, was then held and payed back to each citizen at the end of the year. To this day there is a section of your tax refund that is directly from this bill (although it is not as much anymore, as fossil fuels have been all but fazed out). The US government also stopped subsidizing the fossil fuel, and beef industries, which at the time released most of the carbon dioxide into the air. This increased the price of fossil fuels and beef so much that Americans had no choice but to stop using and eating them. Today land once used for cattle grazing and growing food for cows is now forests that suck carbon dioxide out of the air. Also, renewable farming became subsidized, so the land used to grow crops for people, was not ruined by over farming and chemicals. Renewable energies were also subsidized, companies like Exxon Mobile and Chevron who run wind farms and geothermal plants, used to be in the fossil fuel business, but had to switch because the demand for oil was decreasing massively and fracking, a disastrous way to get oil and natural gas out of the ground, was banned. 
                                       <br><br>


This costed billions at the time, but after a couple of years, the debt started to go away, and the US government started to make more and more money. In fact, for the first time in over a century, the US debt was all but canceled out by 2030. This increase in revenue let the government give back to its citizens and public transportation became extremely common. People no longer had to fly planes or drive cars, they could jump on a subway, bus, or bullet train to get from place to place (all electric by the way). Not to mention, all those who had lost their jobs at the time of the large changes, were given money by the government through government jobs building these modes of transportation, replanting forests, or even taking advantage of renewables. 
                                       <br><br>


What I think the biggest change of this was besides saving the planet, was amending the constitution to reverse the decision made by the supreme court in Citizen’s United. This case said a corporation had the same freedom of speech as an individual, therefore was able to contribute massively to the campaigns of candidates they like more. Through this method, they were able to keep legislation like the Green New Deal off the table for decades while our planet slowly died. This was a moment for the people again, we could have our voices heard once again, and we were not at the whim of the largest and richest people in the world anymore. 
                                       <br><br>


Overall, this was the greatest achievement the US has ever done, and we had won two world wars and dominated the world culture up to that point. We managed to take a look at ourselves and see there was something wrong, and not only fix it, but thrive while fixing it. We showed why the US is the best country in the world and set an example for everyone to follow. We championed the people, giving them a larger say in politics, just as the founding fathers would have wanted and we saved the world. I cannot but to feel for those who never got to see the coral reefs before they died, or the number of exotic and beautiful creatures before they went extinct. Generations after mine never got to see the Amazon rainforest to its fullest extent or experience the plethora of climates that my home state of California once offered, but they will experience what is to come, as see how the planet adapts and changes to accommodate the new world we all share. At least they have a habitable planet to live on, as in 2020, it was not looking like that was going to happen.

Dear Youth of the Future, 
                                       <br><br>


The year is 2060, and things are so much better for you now than when I was your age. It may seem to you like life on Earth was always like this-- idyllic, green, lush, and full of endless possibilities. However, when I was your age the world was much more daunting. Everyone was overwhelmed by the fear of a seemingly unstoppable crisis- climate change. Every day there was news of a new “natural” disaster, wiping out thousands of lives in developing countries, and destroying homes and lives back home too. It seemed hopeless, as the calamities continued, Administration seemed not to care, leaving people to die, not offering aid, and ignoring the outcries of the people. At that stage in my life, I was so hopeless. Nobody seemed to care, especially not those in power. I really truly believed that the climate crisis would never be addressed by the United States, and that I would see the end of the world.
                                       <br><br>


But then, things got worse. Not just slightly worse, but unbelievably disastrous. The Central Valley was hit by a drought like they had never seen, and even moreso, we had already used up all the groundwater and reserves that were available before, we had nothing to grow with. Then the Midwest was struck by a Dust Bowl like we had seen during the Great Depression. Millions of people, livestock, and crops suffered in that region. Because all of these factors had a significant impact on the economic output of the United States, the government finally decided that climate change was worth stopping. I was sad that it took such a huge amount of damage for them to finally take action, but I was glad to finally see it happen.
                                       <br><br>


When the government finally decided to take action, things got better. They began hiring real experts, scientists like me and my husband to help face the technical and agricultural challenges presented. They revamped the EPA, ensuring that it actually worked to protect the environment, not hide the climate crisis from the world. Even more so, they hired social scientists and communication experts to help facilitate societal change in the United States. Combined, with science and the humanities marching hand in hand, we formed a new agency, called the People’s Protection Agency. Our primary goal was to set an example of how to stop the climate crisis for all the countries within our influence. We knew that if the United States put their best foot forward with progressive measures, the rest of the world would follow. First, we re-entered the Paris Accord, and passed the Green New Deal (which was not hard because everyone was on board after the economic crash). The new age was incredible, citizens felt cared for, and they saw the impacts of our work; all of this was possible because the agency recognized and acted on the intersectionalities of the climate crisis and societal change. We worked to make education equal and accessible for children, and college students. We improved living standards by implementing co-housing, wherein people felt that they belonged to a tight-knit community, and reduced their carbon footprint by living in a smaller space. But perhaps the most powerful thing we did was to make the political climate of the United States less polarizing. The crisis we faced after our agricultural sector crashed helped citizens and politicians to feel compassion for one another, rather than resentment based on partisanship. This age was bursting was possibility, but some of the most impactful things we did included: high speed rail connecting cities across state borders, shifting to entirely renewable energy like solar powers and wind turbines. We made jobs better in every city, eliminating the need for excessive commutes, in turn this allowed people to spend more quality time with their families, not worrying about work. I could not be more proud of the work that we put in, when I was your age I never thought that the people of the United States could find it in themselves to put their politics aside, and come together for the common good. We were the generation of change, the generation that shaped society for the rest of humanity’s time on Earth. I hope you carry on this legacy, wherein we care for the planet as if it is our life’s goal, and in turn we care for each other out of compassion.

In 2020, everyone was panicking about a global pandemic. As a result, elections changed from being focused on the climate crisis to how the new president would control the pandemic. As a result, the climate crisis being resolved was delayed. Yet, the reforms that came with the pandemic eventually made it easier for the general public to accept the Green New Deal and other climate resolutions. Although the U.S. still procrastinated, eventually climate change was finally treated as a crisis and the government began to manage carbon emissions more strictly. The general public became more aware and began to live more consciously, although in part they were slightly forced by public policy. Although it was too late to prevent the climate crisis from leaving serious effects on our living conditions, humanity escaped the worst scenario possible, making it somewhat possible for recovery. Still, everyone lamented that we could have prevented the damage from occurring and blamed the ignorant and selfish generation that refused to make simple changes because they were too focused on other issues. Fingers were pointed at the most developed countries, who eventually, under public censure, began being more self-conscious and mindful of the world. After the leading countries began sending relief to areas severely affected by the climate crisis, the world became more equal. People began caring less about whether they were Americans or Canadians or Iranians and started caring about the environment: the entire globe. Since people had to work together to combat climate change, relationships between people became closer, and people eventually felt satisfied by the changes they either chose or were forced to choose to do. Although big, yet empty, dreams, like the American dream at the time, were destroyed and rendered impossible, new dreams became possible due to inequality lessening and people becoming more thoughtful and happy.  
                                       <br><br>


I’d like to apologize to the people reading this. Although I was raised to have a high carbon footprint, I should have changed much sooner than I did. Instead of being scared, not just about the climate crisis, I should have done something. Instead of being envious of those with a growth mindset, I should’ve worked harder to gain it. Instead of admiring activists and those who were unafraid to stand up, I should I have joined them. Instead of hiding behind excuses and avoiding accusations of hypocrisy, I should have done what I could at the time. I couldn’t change on my own, so I had no choice to wait for someone to change the world for me. The greatest obstacle to solving the climate crisis was humanity, but my greatest obstacle was myself. It wasn’t public policy or a lack of money or knowledge, but the fear of the unknown, facing myself, and being othered. I’m glad that I have raised my children to be something I’m not. Even if they have they faults, at least they’re not scared of what’s in their head. It’s a shame they couldn’t have as nice of a childhood that I had, but I’m relieved that they have a world that, despite many obstacles, has evened out to become a happier world. I’d like to remind them that even if the world is an ugly place, you still have loved ones around you. Together, you can make a world a better place even if it’s truly a terrible one. You don’t need to be an activist to make improvements; you just need to be the best yourself you can be. No rush either, since some things come naturally with time. 

                                       <br><br>


Of course, in 2020, we were rather pressed for time. The climate crisis wasn’t looming over the horizon, it was already present. Even before, it wasn’t even trying to hide. Yet, I didn’t realize the true extent of the crisis until I took Climate Crisis 101 at UCSB in my sophomore year. I had already been aware that climate change was a thing at least since high school. Taking a seminar with Ken had also made reality clearer to me, and I had already began emotionally connecting (and wondering about possible careers) with the issue, but the class finally made things feel truly real to me. I still remember being disappointed by how little people seemed to care about the class, as seen in the effort put into the homework and midterm (I still remember someone playing Poptropica during lecture), but I was reassured by the many people who truly cared. There were some really meaningful comments discussed and I still admire the brave people who cared enough to speak at the microphone.  You could say that this class was a turning point for me. After listening to the activists who came in to speak, I felt encouraged by how connected and passionate they were. Since I had to volunteering, I decided to volunteer for the climate crisis, not for what was the most convenient or easy. I contemplated going to an Ecovista meeting, but I was deterred by COVID-19 and my upcoming finals. I still kept the idea in my mind and saved it for after the pandemic became less of a crisis.

                                       <br><br>


After COVID-19 became less of a threat and normal life resumed, I decided to make some adjustments to my lifestyle. I went back and looked at the Climate Crisis 101 in order to see what changes I could easily make at the moment before public policy changed, since I knew it would eventually change for sure. The easiest thing I could do was vote for someone who acknowledged the seriousness of the climate crisis, and I did. That was one thing I could do even without checking Ken’s list of twenty things to do, which was, and still is, extremely important. Since I had moved out of dorms, I began cooking on my own. Since I had more control over my diet, I didn’t go vegan, due to how picky I was, but I avoided beef and tried to eat more climate-friendly choices. I tried to reduce food waste, which was difficult due to cooking for only one person, but it was definitely less food wasted than when eating in the dining halls. When going to buy groceries, I used my bike. For the rest of my life, bikes were always present. Even before knowing about the climate crisis, I had already decided on a maximum of two children. Besides vising my family, I avoided using airplanes. When deciding where to live, I chose more climate-friendly options and bought even less. My parents were against some of my choices, but I eventually communicated to them the importance of living for the climate. At the time, I was uncertain about my career, but I communicated the significance of the climate crisis to the people around me.

What’s up son, it’s your father speaking; if you’re reading this message, the species hasn’t died off yet. That means to some degree we’ve had some success. It’s 2060, And you’re in your freshman year of college. Well, in my freshman year of college, I took Two classes called English 22 and English 23, which taught me about the climate crisis. Before this I have been told many things about the climate crisis, I had been told it didn’t exist, I had been told it did exist, I had been told it was blown way out of proportion, but after taking these two classes, it became clear to me that the climate crisis was a huge issue and that I should devote my life to trying to get my climate footprint to the most minimal I can. I took actions like only riding my bicycle, And sometimes taking the bus, eating a plant-based diet(sometimes), living in small square footage with multiple people. I also became a minimalist, Doing my best to the consumer as little as I can in a consumerist society. At this time, consumerism was at an all-time high. I live next to an oil rig, which also took over the whole world. We ran on fossil fuels, which I know is hard to believe, but this is how it was in 2020.
                                       <br><br>
Shortly after we enacted a bill that didn’t allow fracking within 2500 feet of people, this was one of the many solutions to being able to keep our species alive part of the new deal called the green new deal. It’s a piece of legislation that helped us get to the place we are today, son—being alive. This green new deal at first was not supported by many and still isn’t today, but I think everyone will agree that the consequences of not acting a steel or far higher than what we had to give up to take on the deal. Trump ended up being reelected even though Bernie Sanders had strong support in many of the most populated states. More fires happened, More fracking happened, more fossil fuels were omitted until we are able to get another candidate in the office that fixed all of this. The green new deal was only acted when I was finishing up my MBA. After this, the Democrats take office, and we were able to turn this around even though it should’ve been way overdue. It was almost too late. It was too late, but I’ve been able to drive back better late than never. But since my time has been a drastic change to what it is today, we lived with much more luxuries; they came at a price higher than just the cost of getting the luxury. Anyway, I hope you’re enjoying your first year at College college, it will be a great growing experience, and you have these memories for life. I understand it’s overwhelming, but you will enjoy this experience and learn so much, can’t wait to see you after your fall finals.
                                       <br><br>

It is currently 2060. Though the climate crisis has not been mitigated completely, the world has done a solid job of curbing the changes and their impacts.

One of the biggest steps in the right direction occurred in the 2020 Presidential Election, when the democratic candidate defeated Donald Trump. This new President was aware of the danger of the climate crisis and acted with urgency. The "Green New Deal" was passed a few months after he took office. 
                                       <br><br>


Over the next couple decades, several drastic societal changes occurred in the United States and across the world:

                                       <br><br>

The meat industry - specifically the beef industry - was cut down on. Governments realized the detrimental impact of beef and the methane/carbon emissions it produced and took action by replace much of the meat in the world with "fake" meat. Companies like Morning Star and Beyond started having bigger roles in food production as people transitioned from meat to other food that was equally nutritious. In addition, many people became vegetarians or vegans to help out the environment. Federal governments also passed policies to cut down on food waste.

                                       <br><br>

Transportation across the world was transformed. More and more people moved from individual vehicles to public transport. Bus systems, trains, electric bikes, and fuel-efficient vehicles started to become commonly used, thanks to the help of funding from federal governments that made these systems easier and more comfortable to use. Infrastructure for cyclists was also improved greatly, as wide and safe-to-use bike paths were added near popular roads. In addition, more efficient airplanes were developed and airplane travel in general was cut down. 

                                       <br><br>

There was also a big movement towards solar energy. Many countries mandated that households would get the majority of their electricity through solar power (such as solar panels) as opposed to conventional "2020 electricity". 

                                       <br><br>

Furthermore, companies that relied on carbon, fossil fuels, fracking, and other detrimental activities had to pay for it. A strict carbon tax was placed that deterred companies from relying on harmful production activities. As a result, because these types of companies became less profitable, government representatives and leaders were more inclined to put their financial interests in environmentally efficient companies.

                                       <br><br>

As you can see, as a result of these changes, we were able to save ourselves from some of the potentially very harmful effects of human-caused climate change. However, the job is not finished. We need to make sure we continue to transition to environmentally efficient activities. We will have enforce this cultural mindset moving forward.

To myself,
                                       <br><br>

You're pessimistic but you feel realistic. In 2020, Bernie Sanders lost the democratic primaries and chose to run as an independent, thus splitting the vote, allowing Donald Trump to keep his seat as president. Two Supreme Court justices retire, there spots filled with two more conservative judges. 2020 is not great. 2021 is not great. With the stock market having crashed, the airport industry has also taken a massive hit, rather beneficial for the environment however. American greed continues to skyrocket as much as it can, as the 1% get wealthier and the rest of the world gets poorer and poorer. Things simply are just going terribly. 
                                       <br><br>
However, your generation knows what's up. You know that the environment needs to be saved by immediate action. Radical groups take one for the team, destroying fracking sites, taking down massive industries. The less radical continue to protest outside of animal product production sites to the point where they cannot operate. There is mass violence going on all around the world. In a sense, there is a war. It's global but it's not a world war. It's national but it's a civil war. It's a war to protect the earth so we can survive. The war is won. Life isn't entirely drastically different. Public transportation is high, cars on the road are far fewer, car production is much lower as well. Scientists have developed meat alternatives to those too stubborn to say goodbye to their steaks. These alternatives are cheap and safe for the environment. The economy begins to rise again but no longer dependent on massive corporations and rooted ways of life. 
                                       <br><br>
Now we're dependent on research, on exploration, on preservation. We're focused on making the earth a place that can be survived by more than 5 species. We rebuild coral populations slowly, and rehabilitate endangered species. We regrow forests that had been so terribly degraded to the point where they hardly resembled a forest. Society grows away from global trends. International trade still exists, but the mode of transportation is less catastrophic. We're no longer oil dependent. The Koch brothers are dead. Life will be good.

To 2060, if you're reading this then it worked. then the world didn't end and humans did their part; we took it seriously. I am a second-year in college, and I am writing from the year 2020. As of this moment, the world feels like it is about to end. I am genuinely afraid for the end of the world, and the fact that that’s not an exaggeration is even more frightening. So many scary things are happening right now and it almost feels apocalyptic. Fires are getting worse, and they're spreading to areas that were once unfamiliar to its ravage. Sea levels are rising, natural floodings have become somewhat common and hurricanes are more present and stronger. The climate crisis is exponentially getting worst, and there are still people out there who think it is a hoax. Despite the doubt, I cast on my generation, I also carry hope because of the small changes we have made in our lifetime. There are people who are doing their best to alleviate the climate crisis. In our own way, we each played our part to help the environment and I would like to share my contribution. 
                                       <br><br>

Public transportation is a big factor. I grew up in the city and the traffic became so familiar to me. Driving did not really feel like an option so I took the bus, and I honestly found it relaxing. It was the one part of the day where I really was able to center on my thoughts and just absorb everything around me. Before, when I would sit in the backseat of my parent's car, the only way I knew how to get somewhere was by looking at my surroundings and recognizing that one liquor store my friends always walked to. But taking the bus really forced me to know my street names and the different stops. Buses are cool,  but I also enjoyed walking. I am studying in Santa Barbara and there is no car traffic at all, everyone bikes here and while there are the occasional accidents, it is still the best and main method of transportation. Walking helps the planet because it reduces your carbon emissions as opposed to driving alone in a car. 
                                       <br><br>

Cutting down on meat was also crucial. Now in Isla Vista, I try to eat less meat but it's because I have freedom in what groceries I buy and access to an online platform where we can share all kinds of vegetarian recipes. While I can't see myself becoming completely vegetarian, I try to cut down on meat and not waste food.
                                       <br><br>

Our earth is in a state of emergency, and unfortunately, my generation has to deal with its consequences. However, because of this, we know better and we know we want better. Simplifying is another cool way I have lessened my carbon footprint. By taking a minimalistic approach, I try sticking to the basics and buying things that I need rather than want. On this journey, I’ve realized that you have to make a distinguishable line between desires and basic necessities. And while it does not mean I have been able to stop myself from the occasional, impulsive purchase, I have become more aware of the things I keep in my home. 
                                       <br><br>

Thrifting is another area that I’ve taken up on my path to reducing carbon emissions. Consumerism plays a heavy role in my society and fast-fashion takes advantage of this. Fast fashion has given Americans access to a variety of styles for a cheap tag price and the lives of those who make it possible. People are forced to work in harsh circumstances so that they can support themselves and their families, but they're not even being paid enough. Knowing this, I try to stay away from companies like that and instead I support local vintage stores or thrift shops, which I love doing with my friends. 
                                       <br><br>

Last year I took a feminist studies class, and we learned the effectiveness of women being educated about their bodies. While there was a sense of sexual liberation,  the class also taught me that there was a direct link between educated women and having kids. In this sense, I try to be active in supporting my beliefs, and not just for equal education. Voting is important, especially for people who advocate for the same things as you do. So I try to be educated on who I am voting for and active during elections. Being aware is important, especially knowing your subject matter, political action is necessary because it forces the government and people in power to recognize the issue on a global scale and implement necessary changes. 
                                       <br><br>

My generation has been through a lot. 40 years is a long time and by the time you read this, I will be 60 years old. I hope that within those years, my generation has done enough so that your generation can live without the same fears I carry. I hope that you’ve developed more sustainable practices and I hope you continue to expand on those. I hope I get to see it all come together. And if not, I hope my grandchildren have somewhere to call home so that I can take comfort in the fact that we did what we could and we did it with eagerness.

Believe or not, this is you from 2060. Yes, you are a 60 years old lady. You cannot play basketball as smooth as like what you can before 2020 before. You are too old to play, but maybe keeping on riding the bicycle will be a nice choice for you. Because since you are a child you decide to ride a bike for the whole time. 
                                       <br><br>
When u are only 4 or 5 years old. You enjoy riding a bicycle with your elder sister in the garden under the apartments. Even though your sister falls from the ground and hurts herself. You still want to ride as fast as you can. When you are a teenager, there is a lot of mobile bikes in SY. You registered every mobile bike app and beg your dad to give you the deposit to get permission to ride. After that, for the whole summer, you ride this bike anywhere you can. From HG district to HP district, just ride anywhere you want to and to miss or visit anyone who just flashes on your mind. and goes to Starbucks next to your high school that tries to coincidence, someone. After your study abroad, though many peers’ Chinese international students are always owning some luxury cars to show off. You still riding bikes to school even from freshman or sophomore. Though you have your first car in your sophomore winter quarter which you mum and dad did not approve yet. You still will ride to the bike to school after the FKin coronavirus. Also during the time you wasting time at home, you are missing your bike for the whole time and wish to ride it any time you can. Red wheels and black holder. The most unique one in UCSB that there is no second one ever in the world.
                                       <br><br>
Riding bike, not only because I love riding the bike and enjoy airflow on my face, but also it can also reduce a lot of carbonic dioxides. Since you became environmental studies major students in your college first year. You knew a lot of things about the damage that people have provided to the whole world and also a lot of inevitable things that we cannot save. Then you decided to change your major into econ, you want to change the way people using the limited resource. Though I cannot tell you if you get enrolled in this department. But I can tell that as long as you have the ambition to fight and save the environment. You will succeed.
                                       <br><br>
So just keep on riding, Freda. Do not waste time on something useless and protect the people you love as much as you can. Be proud of yourself and keep more touch with your parents. They are the generation that used the resource wrongly but still thrive in discovering the best way to figure those environmental problems for their next-generation -us. So, more respect and love to your dad and mom in the limited time you spend with them. Maybe bought your first car without dad’s permission is not a great idea. But you should still love them and tell them the detail someday. 
                                       <br><br>
Take care and wish you luck. I will see you in the next 40 years:)

The year is 2060, and though policy has gotten better and towards a zero-emission nation, we still have work to do. Yes, there are climate refugees, agriculture has dramatically shifted to adapt to the climate, and drought and extreme heat continue to threaten millions daily. In 2020, our nation would have been much better off combatting climate change if Bernie Sanders had won presidency. However, his policies seemed too far left for most of America, those who didn’t consider the truthful deteriorating state of our nation, so he did not win the democratic nominee. Instead, Joe Biden won office, and though he worked to combat climate change, his policies didn’t have the same push or funding that Bernie Sanders had planned for. Although Trump was voted out of office, the nation did not immediately decarbonize, and the renewable energy sector only slightly grew.
                                        <br><br>

A lot of people around the world still did not believe in climate change in 2020. However, this changed in the following decade as increasingly large natural disasters destroyed cities across the globe. People finally realized it was not a natural cycle of Earth; it was a man made one. Thus, climate activist groups like the Sunrise Movement and 350.org gained support from entire cities of people who lost their homes. They traveled the US convincing people the climate change was no joke. These activist groups finally gained enough attention throughout the decade that in 2032, a progressive candidate won office and pushed for sweeping reform and decarbonization and declared the United States in a national emergency.
                                        <br><br>

As people in the US saw the effects of carbon in the atmosphere more regularly and renewable energy got cheaper, most US people switched to electric cars as the US implemented millions of charging stations around roads everywhere. 6/10 houses used solar or wind energy, and nuclear energy gained momentum as scientists found a way to safely contain it. Fracking was made illegal. Oil companies started to lose business as the world moved away from fossil fuels and the finite supply of oil depleted, causing gasoline prices to sometimes hit $10/gallon. 
                                       <br><br>
The saddest part is, we are still on our way to go over the 2º mark. If people in 2020 would have realized the severity of the climate crisis like Ken Hiltner pointed out to me at UCSB and David Wallace Wells lectured to me at an Arts & Lectures event, the world would have elected the progressive presidential candidate earlier, and sweeping policy would have weeded away from fossil fuels and greenhouse gases earlier. All in all, I was scared our world would never take the extreme measures needed to combat climate change, but in the year 2060, we are so close to being 100% fossil fuel free.

The environmental issue is the central topic of this course. To overcome the environmental issue is not a short-term process. The conscious to protect the environment is the most important thing for the environment protecting. When people truly aware the important about the environment protecting, they will not do those environmental protecting behavior by themself but they will also encourage people around them to do them. All the behaviors mentioned in the video are small. However, it is really hard to keep those behaviors in a lifetime. 

                                       <br><br>

I really admire people like Professor Ken Hiltner, the alumni of UCSB who hold environmental activity. They work hard to get the knowledge and education background. They can use their resources to achieve worldly success which means more money, power, and fame. However, they choose to use their ability to contribute to the world by protecting the environment. They scrafy their own life (the time, the consuming, and so on) to make our world become better.

        Whats up. This is you from the future, in the year 2060. A lot has changed. You aren't going to like what I have to say. I know this sounds fake but you always wanted to know or talk to yourself from the future when you or I because I'm you, we were a kid. This is so cool that I can do this right now this seemed like it was impossible when it was 2020. We haven’t been able to time travel because our body molecules get destroyed and we die, R.I.P. Lil Dicky, he died when he discovered time travel and tried to travel himself. So we can’t time travel ourselves but we can send letters and items for us instead. Shhh. don’t tell anyone I told you this. If this doesn’t make you believe that I am you then I don’t know what will. This is totally me and you. 
                                       <br><br>

         In 2019 Lil Dicky released the song Earth to share the love for our planet. He was trying to promote awareness for the climate crisis and he even put Leonardo Dicaprio in the song who was your UN Messenger of Peace. He did the best that he could but people just weren’t listening to him. It got really bad and they ran out of options so someone in the lab released COVID-19. This threw people into panic and hysteria. This was not the pla. Everything went online. No one went outside anymore. Amazon drones took off and everyone started ordering their necessities online. Every city looked abandoned and they still are today.. This helped the earth with reducing the carbon emissions initially but now everyone misses out on social interaction now. We want to change the way society is working now. I need you to do something about this. We need a happy medium. Sure, teleconferencing is convenient and social media allows us to have a fabricated sense of social interaction. However, we all suffer from severe mental illness now. Humans are a social species and we cannot go without interaction forever. 
                                       <br><br>

         I need you to exercise your right to vote and push for campaigns that put climate change at the forefront of issues but also maintains our social fabric. You have to vote in order to redirect the money to build structures that will allow us to travel by bullet trains so that we no longer need to use planes. Underwater tunnels can be useful for travel across continents. Other alternatives for traveling helps us stay connected rather than remaining in isolation. It would also be faster and more reliable to use public transportation today if you all had voted to put the infrastructure in place in the first place. Don't make the mistake of listening to the mass media. Instead, take matters into your own hands. Stay educated and pay attention to the science rather than social media and bias news outlets. This is an issue that can be solved without decade long quarantines. Take what Ken told you in lecture seriously. Don't make the same mistake that his generation did. I hope you can rewrite the course of history so that I can see a 2060 where kids still play with one another and we are still allowed to attend concerts. We need to keep our health and the health of our planet in mind as we move forward or should I say as you move forward since the future is counting on you.

What's good future self,

                                       <br><br>

How are things? Hopefully not too bad. You should have spent your last 40 years doing everything you could to make your future, and everyone else's future, as good as possible. You were given all the information and solutions by now, so I hope you spent your time educating other people as much as you could and acting on solutions to reduce your carbon footprint. If you haven't, your present likely is not too hot (aside from the weather). 

                                       <br><br>

Times are pretty crazy now as everyone is scrambling to come up with solutions for gross consumption and carbon emissions. A lot of people are still ignorant as to the magnitude of the problems at hand, but this is quickly changing as people are becoming more educated as the media can not hide its effects any longer and people have to acknowledge the growing issues of climate change.

                                       <br><br>

I fear the circumstances you read this letter from, as I have just learned of all of the plausible outcomes for forty years from now and most of them are rather dire. You should have adopted a much more minimalist lifestyle, and ate a lot less meat as you intended after writing this letter, and reduced your consumption. If you didn't, shame on you for contributing to the problem. 

                                       <br><br>

Continue your career in public office, or philanthropy, whatever you decided you would be able to have the most impact with, and keep doing as much as you can to benefit the world and other people. After all it is our planet not just any individual's. 

                                       <br><br>

I am confident that 40 years from now you will have worked with the rest of the world to defy the odds and create the grand future you envision now. Life's always good and will always get better with the right mindset. 

                                       <br><br>

Keep striving brother

I am glad you're reading this! That means we were successful. Things are looking really grim right now. While we know now everything we are supposed to do to reverse the effects of climate change as much as we can, we are still slow to implement. A lot of people are still ignorant as to the magnitude of the problem we face right now, but people are becoming educated fast as the effects are indisputable and increasing.

                                       <br><br>

Gross consumerism and carbon emissions are to fault for the myriad of problems our world is facing now, which I know you'll still feel be facing as you read this letter. I hope they have reversed somewhat at least, and the world has not descended into total anarchy by when you are reading this. I hope culture has changed, so that people are much more grateful just for what they have and can be satisfied with their basic needs fulfilled, and good friends and family around them. Climate change and the necessity of reversing its terrible effects may even be a small blessing in disguise, if people can learn to separate themselves from their social media and all of their stuff. I hope people are healthier and happier as they eat better, specifically less meat. I hope the earth is returning to its intended state, and there are more free-living animals. I hope the fish are not all gone from the seas, and there are still some coral reefs for you to visit. I hope there are still some beautiful natural wonders in the world, and that you do as much as you can to be connected with nature.

                                       <br><br>

In whatever circumstances you read this from, understand it could have been a lot worse if it was not for so many people today doing everything they could fighting for your tomorrow. Be vigilant and continue to do everything you are to take care of our climate, we only get one Earth.

You are going to be glad that you took The Climate Crisis that hectic winter quarter at UCSB. As proven in history being well informed turned out to be the key part of surviving. Well, at first it was more surviving but now we have found a way to cope. Shortly after you ended your quarter at UCSB and flew back to the Netherlands (Also the last time you flew) The democrats won the election. Unfortunately this did not immediately mean that the green new deal was instituted or anything, just a step in the right direction. The real change was caused by the Corona virus. The realisation that we humans are so vulnerable, so subjected to nature, switched something in a lot of peoples mindset. The number of climate rallies increased after the quarantine was lifted and climate activists seized the momentum to put the most important issue of our time on the agenda indefinitely. The Countdown Has Started I believe was the slogan at the time (this led to a  fun endorsement with Europe). Activist seized every opportunity on social media and in the classic media to advocate the severe consequences it will have if we don’t act now. 
                                          <br><br>
  This started the momentum of in the right direction, but more than activism was needed, like the slogan stated time was counting down for not only the human race (we like to put ourself in the centre of attention) but for the whole planate. Legislation was needed and this started with the Brussels Agreement were most of the countries in the European union agreed to seize using fossil fuels. This time repercussions we're discussed. A trading ban for every country that didn’t achieve these goals by 2030. Because let’s be honest, the economy is the only way to motivate people in our capitalistic society. As for America they fell behind, the fatal flaws of capitalism get exposed the most in the countries that praise this system the highest. For a country so dependent on fossil fuel it wasn’t really an option to enter in the Agreement right away but the Democratic government did institute some taxes on gasoline and other fuels. This lowered the emission but didn’t wipe it out by a long shot. The real change came when in 2030 the European Union leveraged their fossil free position to get America to commit with the same travel ban repercussion they instituted in their own Agreement. America finally committed, better late than never.
                                       <br><br>
     This all seems nice but let’s not forget the downside. In the mean time these countries were finally committing a lot of awful thing happened. eastern-asian countries flooded regularly, a lot of workers lost their jobs when factories shut down, another virus severely dialled back the population in Asia and Africa. The lopsidedness of consequences became awfully clear. The ones that did the littlest to cause the crisis carried the heaviest burdens. 
                                       <br><br>
     One of the most influential things was the thrift movement. This organisation run by young activists focussed on getting big sports organisations like the NBA to commit to using jerseys multiple times. Once they got the NFL, NHL and NBA to commit they got a deal with the whole of Nike, who saw that this image shift could be crucial. Jerseys got recycled and the consumption culture took a big hit. 
                                       <br><br>
     In the end that is what it is all about, it has been the main focus of the course so far and it will be the main way we get people to change for the time to come, cultural change. Nothing influences people more than other people, we need leaders, but leaders by example. Because every person that helps a little helps enforce a system of change. I wouldn’t even say it was my generation as much as it was the one after us that really instituted the most radical changes. They utilised all their knowledge about media to influence and gain power in ways other generations didn’t know. If you are reading this, it was a rocky road but we made it.

I always dreamed of a utopia. A world where children were educated, not just in the sciences and the arts, but social justice and empathy. A world where people had short work weeks, so they had more time for friends and family. A world where you only used what you needed and a majority of what you need is made in your own hometown. A world where parents walk their children to school, then bike to their jobs from there. A world where fresh food is grown locally and little is wasted, with a large portion of that diet being plant-based. This is not that future.
                                       <br><br>
I could say it started in the year 2020, that would be a lie. We knew about this for years. Scientists and the people in charge knew about this well before even I was born. They did nothing. When I and my peers grew old enough to finally see what was going on around us, we were angry, rightfully angry. You're probably angry too. We tried to be heard by the generation in power. They ignored us and catered to big business and the one percent instead.
                                       <br><br>
I wonder if the children, if the grandchildren of those who refused to believe the facts are grateful for those choices. All the money in the world can't buy you a trip to the rain forest anymore. It's gone. Sure, there's the simulated ones in restaurants in tourist towns. But, trust me when I say this, it's not the same.
                                       <br><br>
It's hot these days. I know you don't believe me when I say it, but it used to be cool here. I could watch the fog flow from my back garden to the valley. It was cool on my skin. "Mom, it's always been this hot," you say. You're so young, you don't know any other world. I suppose I don't either. It hasn't always been hot.
                                       <br><br>
I still have that back garden. I used to grow flowers there. Foxglove, they were called. Pink, bell-shaped, gorgeous. But not edible. I used to be able to garden what I wanted, simply because I could. Now I garden because I can't let my children starve. And my children can't eat foxglove.
                                       <br><br>
Do you see that strip of beach there? If you were to walk into the water, then keep swimming until you can't swim anymore, you'd be floating over the ruins of my old town. A lot of things were saved. The floods were bad, but people are crafty. And people love their things. If you dived down there, you could find my old school, where we were taught climate change is a two-sided issue. In a way, it still is: Climate change is real and bad vs. climate change is very real and very bad.
                                       <br><br>
When I said I wanted to go back to the old ways of living, I didn't mean this. I didn't mean struggling for my and my family's lives. But this is what I was forced into. This is what we were all forced into. The world doesn't end in fire. The world doesn't end in ice. The world ends in us. And we end with it.

Back in 2020, the Democratic Presidential race highlighted a growing ideological split both within the party, between Democratic Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders and moderate, traditional Democrat Joe Biden, and between the Democratic and Republican parties. Senator Sanders campaigned on a platform that would revolutionize American capitalism to make it work for the neglected majority through socialist programs like Medicare for All, Universal Child Care, a Federal Jobs Guarantee, and, most importantly, a Green New Deal. Not only would these programs allow low and middle income Americans to live dignified lives with potential for economic mobility, but upon the implementation of a Green New Deal, they would facilitate the country’s transition to an economy completely run on renewable energy sources. Through providing meaningful jobs in energy and agricultural sectors that pay a living wage and adequate benefits, the Green New Deal would provide the best incentive for America’s economy to substantially decrease carbon emissions and mitigate the impending climate crisis. 
                                       <br><br>

The emphasis is on “would.” Bernie Sanders did not win the Democratic nomination. Joe Biden, unfortunately, became the nominee. But luckily, he was able to beat Donald Trump in the general election, becoming the 46th president of the United States. 
                                       <br><br>

While we flipped the White House, we failed to flip the Senate. As a traditional, moderate Democrat, Biden just didn’t match up to the revolutionary change proposed by Sanders and needed in that pivotal decade. While he attempted to pass through as many elements of a Green New Deal as he could, Biden refused to ban fracking, existing fossil fuel extraction (despite banning new projects), and crude oil exports. In general, Biden’s climate agenda was just not enough and not nearly as ambitious as what was needed to address the crisis. Scientists said we needed to take drastic measures by 2030 to stay below catastrophic conditions. Biden wanted to get the nation to net-zero emissions by 2050 -- 20 years too late. 
                                       <br><br>

The bad news is that we failed as a nation to meet scientists’ threshold for mitigating the climate crisis. And, as one of the greatest global emitters of CO2, we failed to mobilize other countries to take action when it was needed.
                                       <br><br>

But the good news is, it’s 2060, 30 years after the catastrophic threshold, and I’m able to write this. For a few reasons -- I live in the United States, for one -- while we emit the most, we’ll also be one of the last to be affected. Two -- everyone started to care about what had been a 70-year long issue once it finally appeared in their face in 2030. Once more cities burned down, once more people experienced unprecedented extreme weather, once more people started to die, then people cared. Then politicians woke up. The fucking sad reality of human nature showed itself in 2030. We only start to care about things when they affect us directly.
                                       <br><br>

But this was supposed to be good news. Because people began taking action after-the-fact, we’re mitigating greater temperature rise. Governments are trying to fix their mess. If only we had Bernie Sanders to lead the revolution before it was too late.

To my grandchildren, a story from the past:
                                       <br><br>
Even long before I was born, we knew that there was a problem. As I entered my first year of college, the time to act was urgent, yet many still didn’t understand that. We needed a revolution, but the people weren’t ready. I mean, it makes sense: when you hear two sides of a story, one that ends in mass destruction and one that doesn’t, it’s easier to believe the latter. When the 2020 election rolled around, I knew that it was going to be one of our last chances to take aggressive action, and finally enact the emergency procedures that we needed. But when it came down to it, we fell short. The people didn’t think that putting someone in power that would revolutionize the country was safe, and it would hurt us more. 
                                       <br><br>
They were wrong.
                                       <br><br>
Things got worse, and the kind of action that was needed still wasn’t taken. So we took to the streets. We marched and we lobbied and we stepped up and started taking power for ourselves. We took action within our own communities, creating eco villages and implementing sustainability into many parts of our lives. My housemates and I got very involved, striving to become zero-waste; we volunteered in the local community gardens and took up composting and started upcycling old clothing and biking everywhere.
                                       <br><br>
It was hard to understand, though, why so many people weren’t as scared as the rest of us. I think for a lot of people, it still felt really far away. But that didn’t last long.
                                       <br><br>
Because then it became undeniable. Crops started failing in areas they had thrived for years. Countless hurricanes hit, getting worse than anything we had seen before each time. Species died off by the dozens. And then Miami went underwater. Refugees flooded the cities, and they had nowhere to go. The economy crashed.
                                       <br><br>
At last, we couldn’t deny, and we definitely couldn’t ignore it. 
                                       <br><br>
And out of the ruins, something beautiful grew. People began to take action everywhere. Public transportation was improved, and we made a commitment to using it. I joined a cohousing community, and my kids got to grow up in a wonderful community that valued sustaining the planet. A plenitude economy was created. We were able to cut emissions down exponentially.
                                       <br><br>
It wasn’t easy. We lost a lot along the way. But what grew out of the destruction was a magnificent thing.

<p>
It’s 3:23 AM.                                        <br><br>

I can’t sleep. 
                                       <br><br>
And I’m awake with  the biggest smile on my face looking back on a conversation earlier in the day:  
                                       <br><br>
My grandchildren asked me: 
                                       <br><br>
“‘What did you do while the planet was plundered?
                                       <br><br>
What did you do when the earth was unraveling?
                                       <br><br>
Surely you did something when the seasons started flailing?
                                       <br><br>
As the mammals, reptiles and birds were all dying?
                                       <br><br>
Did you fill the streets with protest?
                                       <br><br>
When democracy was stolen, what did you do once you knew?
                                       <br><br>
Surely, you did something…’” (Dellinger)
                                       <br><br>
And I replied, “yes I did indeed do something, now gather around as I take you back to the year 2019”.
                                       <br><br>
“It’s September, that’s me with the sunglasses and the neon green sign. I just finished making my first speech at a climate march, not bad for my first day in Santa Barbara. The air is energized and full of optimism and a drive for change. As the other speeches finished up, I took my first real steps on my environmental journey and I didn’t even know it yet. A week later I found myself in Ken Hiltner’s English 22 class. I thought we were going to be reading poems about flowers, but we instead took on the climate crisis. I had always thought of myself as an environmentalist with my veganniversary coming in March and for being a climate activist, but this class changed everything. The next thing I knew I was shaking hands with the co-chairs of EAB, I had just accepted my position as a social chair and I went on to plan events that made people appreciate being out in nature, that made them think about where their food came from, and encouraging them to make more zero waste choices. A few months later I was making calls and donating to the Bernie Sanders's campaign and on March 3rd I cast my ballot. I couldn’t have been happier with the November results. We finally had a president who wanted to address the climate crisis and who wanted to help empower people along the way. 
                                       <br><br>
    A few years later and my time as the co-chair of EAB has come to a close. I was satisfied with how I spent my time and that I got better acquainted with Eco-Vista and the Edible Campus Program along the way. And the next thing I knew, I got my diploma for a BA in Environmental Studies. I had the skills that would serve me well in my next chapter: Law School. 
                                       <br><br>
    After a long train ride (since I forfeited air travel) I arrived in New Orleans to study at Tulane’s Environmental Law program, the best of the best. Now the Green Deal had been put into action, but we still needed help. More conservative states were still dragging their heels on climate action, and time was running out. Being in New Orleans made me realize that a fight for the climate had to be one with no compromises and one that could garner support from people of all backgrounds. So I joined a local environmental organization and started to tell people the truth about climate change and how susceptible the city was. It was a strong grassroots movement in New Orleans and we convinced people to use not only their voices but also their actions to start change. And we saw it happen. The city started to enforce carbon fees, they started growing coastal mangroves to mitigate floods, and the city of New Orleans was better for it. Who knew that what started as an assembly of concerned residents could turn the city around. 
                                       <br><br>
    Then I got my law degree. And it was finally time to do what I had always wanted to do, to be a voice for science and a genus loci for the environment. I knew what I wanted to do, but not where to do it. So I joined a firm back at my old home in California. They had me take trains all around the country to fight for and protect the environment and those who relied on it. My speciality was Environmental Justice. I helped communities who needed a legal voice to have one, and I helped to get clean energy installed where the outdated fossil fuel plants were still trying to sneak in under new legislation”. 
                                       <br><br>
    My grandchildren were excited and inspired by my story as they ran off into the back yard. I now live in my modest tiny house, with a permaculture garden that my grandkids love, that’s still too small for what I have planned for it. My grandkids come and visit me on the weekends and we harvest whatever the garden has ready for us. Climate change was the serious issue of my time, and it took a lot of pushing to get wide scale action. But I am somehow grateful that climate change was the “interesting time” I got to live in. At the end of the day I have always loved the environment and the intrinsic value it gives to all of us. It grounds us in ways that are indescribable. But when the planet was in trouble, I am so glad that I can say I played at least a small part in saving it.

<p>
My personal story about the climate crisis began 40 years ago in 2020. That winter, I enrolled in a university english course about the climate during my freshman year of college. I would be lying if I told you today I took the class out of deep concern for the climate at that time: many of us in the course were attracted to it due to the general education requirements it fulfilled and the interesting format of the class. However, over the course of the quarter the class piqued my curiosity regarding the climate crisis. I began to realize the true threat posed to our country and world by a rapidly changing world climate. As it turned out, my interest in the issue came at the right time, as 2020 turned out to be a major turning point in the course of the climate crisis. 
                                       <br><br>

While interest in the climate crisis surged in late 2019 and early 2020 due to Presidential candidates devoting unprecedented attention to it during the primary, the COVID-19 pandemic that spring shifted peoples focus for several months. However, that fall a historic Atlantic hurricane season refocused the national conversation on the climate crisis. In a matter of months, Miami experienced massive flooding, destroying infrastructure on a scale not seen since Hurricane Katrina. Soon after, in November, massive wild land fires in California and Alaska fueled by a lackluster winter the year before destroyed more natural resources and property than ever before. Additionally, Additional research and reporting continued to show how climate change is driving regional instability in the Middle East and North Africa, lending credence to claims that there will be large scale migrations due to the climate crisis. While these events continued to convince people that action needed to be taken, the only political change taken that year was the creation of a new committee to discuss potential new legislation. Activists continued to push for more comprehensive solutions. 
                                       <br><br>

During this time, I began to become more personally aware of my climate footprint. I reduced my amount of airplane flights and structured my life so my primary source of transportation was biking and walking. Additionally, I scaled down my consumption of animal based foods, and used my backyard to grow food in a sustainable way. My political decisions took into account whether the candidate proposed solutions that I thought were pragmatic and would realistically help to combat the climate crisis. 
                                       <br><br>

By 2025, the situation was critical, many low-lying coastal areas were regularly flooded and largely uninhabitable. This caused widespread homelessness and created climate refugees. Additionally, the impact of increased temperatures on animals and plants threatened our food supply and fueled instability in many parts of the world. However, due to a surge in public support for climate action during the 2024 election, congress began to draft far-reaching legislation based on the recommendations of scientists and policy experts. The bill was largely based on the findings of Project Drawdown.
                                       <br><br>

Now in the year 2060 we know that we are still suffering the effects of the climate crisis. Every year we have to continue adapting our lifestyles and coping with the changes. However, scientists believe we have done enough to stop additional warming. While the action taken in 2025 should have been taken earlier, it is undeniable that it was instrumental in helping us avoid the worst effects of climate change. We should be proud of what we have all accomplished, but the fight is not over. We need to continue to make changes to ensure our planet continues to recover.

Dear self,
                                          <br><br>
  This is a letter from 2060, and the climate crisis is not reversed and even become worse. 
                                       <br><br>
     The blueprint of the Green New Deal is considered as conspiracy since social media utilizes the tactical framing to tell the public that the Green New Deal is a strategy that Democrats use to attract voters. Moreover, most people tend to believe the candidates who are funded by fossil fuel companies, because they do not ask people to consume less and prevent people from driving cars by imposing the carbon tax. They pretend that they are candidates who care about people's well being, but their policies will have a great impact on the planet. The natural resource, all the species on the planet, and the climate of the planet will change dramatically. However, these candidates only care about corporate interest, and they are shortsighted, and their behavior will result in a huge disaster. Many epidemic diseases were released from Antarctica because of global warming, and the earth gets warmer and warmer since water's albedo is lower than ice's albedo, which forms a positive feedback. Furthermore, many people died because of the increment of temperature, and weird weather occurs more often. Also, the tornados are getting stronger and stronger, because the ocean is warmer. Ocean not only becomes warmer, but it also becomes more acid, which makes most coral goes to extinction. 
                                       <br><br>
     People are accustomed to the patterns with high CO2 footprint, and they are not willing to make changes. Moreover, K12 teachers and students are brain-washed by the argument that written by Heartland Institute which is funded by fossil fuel companies. With deny and debate, the climate crisis is impeding and there is less and less time for people to take action.  Nevertheless, people are not aware of the issue, and most developing countries are still using coal as the main source to produce energy. Since most of the oil is drilled from the ground, fossil fuel companies have to dig deeper and exploit more beautiful places to drill fossil fuel. Also, people keep that large amount of livestock which releases lots of methane (GHG) into the atmosphere. It is very difficult to persuade people to live in a small house since they pursue comfortable and unfettered life rather than living in a room that makes them feel constricted.  
                                       <br><br>
     Some people may think the passage " The Inhabitable Earth" seems too alarmism, but the author just depicts a future which will be if people can not take effective action to mitigate the climate crisis, and it is the World which we are living in now. All predictions made in the passage came true. There are so many people who just believe the climate crisis will not occur during their lifespan, and there are only a few activists taking actions to vote and change their lifestyles. Nowadays, people in developed countries are living in big houses with air-conditioners, and they work in their houses. On the contrary, people live in poor countries do not have any protection to deal with the high temperature, and many people die during working in the factory. Also, there is lots of waste produced by developed countries, and they send this waste to poor countries. Furthermore, animals can not deal with the high temperature as well, and they can not evolve that fast to adapt to the changing environment, and most of them go to extinction. 
                                       <br><br>
     Thus, I am writing to you to remind you that the climate crisis is real and is caused by humans. There is still time for people to take action, but they need to act immediately. There are some advices which they can do from the personal approach that I hope you can tell others.
                                       <br><br>
1. Taking mass transportation instead of driving cars.
                                       <br><br>
2. Living in micro-apartments or co-housing rather than macro-mansions.
                                       <br><br>
3. Producing less waste and eating plant-based food.
                                       <br><br>
4. Buying less stuff.
                                       <br><br>
5. Repairing or exchanging stuff instead of discarding stuff.
                                       <br><br>
Also, there is one of the most important things that people should do from the collective approach is to vote for the candidates who manage to reverse the climate crisis.

Forty years has not passed without significant turmoil.  It was horrifying to begin our cultural descent that really took a sharp decline beginning in 2020.  There was a series of some pretty tragic freak occurrences and nothing the global community never recovered.  It was sad because there was an abundance of information coming out right at that time.  I remember the E23 class I took at UCSB in my freshman year empowered myself and my fellow peers so much.  It seemed like we were minutes from waking up the sleeping giant.  We would finally trip the wire that would shock enough people into action, where we could unite behind one another, put our differences aside and collaborate to play significant action to try to delay our impending demise.  It seemed like we were so close.  In the beginning of 2020, the 2019 climate report was released.  It was our 43rd year on consecutive overall heat rise.  North America experienced a .9 degree celcius temperature rise from the decade average.  That year not only did every continent experience a record high, but nowhere on the globe experienced a record cold.  For years, information about the gasses trapped in our atmosphere, clouding our symbiotic relationship with the sun, forcing the hot air to bounce around or planet, was spred to the general public.  Taught in science classes, internet videos, global initiatives and community campaigns.  It seemed like the upcoming generation of young people could be influential adults with enough power to shake the system.  Scarily enough, that didnt happen.  We don’t know if it was a lack of voter turn out, or loyalty to big business or neglect of students around the country, but something happened where we all fell to silence and let the cracking boom of infinite consumerism consume us right back.  It was crazy to watch the world call into nothingness when the Covid-19 pandemic hit.  People across the United States were urged to remain in social isolation for months.  Italy and Spain shut down.  China was scrambling to reassemble from the tumultuous times.  Watching everything come to a screeching halt was amazing.  It seemed like it was clear that the world is a collective, we understood the world was truly smaller than we imagined and that everything we did was our choice.  It seemed like the perfect recipe for regrowth.  Everything needed for a social revolution, a clean slate with an open starting point, emotionally charged humans and basically a global near death experience.  Somehow, somewhere, we let it slip through our hands.  We didn’t wake up.  We didn’t gather as a global community.  We allowed the illness to be a racially charged catalyst that promoted xenophobic mentalities and made everything suspicious of their neighbors.  Our humanity was shrinking and it seemed like we had long passed a point of no return.  All regard for human life was placed on second tier.  As we began to approach the 2 degree Celsius rise cap, people got more and more aggressive.  Well obviously in the way that violent crime surges when temperatures rise, but also that people just fell to dispair and wanted to live the most indulgent life possible if the world was going to fall to flames.  And that it did, we drilled into the ground until our tanks would no longer fill, we fired plumes of every burning plastic into the clear night sky.  We ran the rivers dry and waged war on one another.  We ran ourselves right into the ground.  It was only until some of the animals took over that things started to calm down.  The ANIMAL initiative is probably the sole reason for human existence at this point. And surprisingly we are living a more sustainable one than the one we tried to carry for the past 100 years.  ANIMAL was a six point initiative with the goal of protecting humans from themselves.  Restoring natural biomass to 30% tamed wilderness and 70% human inhabitance.  Our cities fell to ruin as we drove our global economies into the ground, when our currency collapsed, ANIMALs had no problem bulldozing the desolate concrete landscapes we built so precariously and replaced them with natural teeming meadows, lush with oxygen producing, carbon consuming plants.  Humans were no longer permitted to eat me, we couldn’t be trusted to do it responsibly or in moderation, so veganism defines us.  We are not entirely reliant on animals for our sustenance and we have a massive population of wild animals who are also valuable sentient land dwelling creatures like ourselves.  The human/animal barrier began to fall, we began to respect our Earthly brothers and creatures and modeled ourselves after them, respecting moderation, community and the habitat we are outrageously lucky to happen.  If there were a parallel universe where time was slowed and it was mid march of 2020, I would hope that they dont meet the same future as us.  I hope that a wake up call doesnt scare people and make them feel inclined to bury their heads in the sand.  I hope that it lights an eternal flame under their feet.

Hi!                                       <br><br>

This is yourself from 2060. I am writing to you in order to tell you some inspiring news! 
                                       <br><br>
I know that you are now in 2020, which is in your freshman year at the University of California-Santa Barbara. Until now, when I retrospect the time I stayed on campus, I will still feel that it is my pleasure to have a chance to take the ENGL 23 course in Winter 2020. In this course, I learned a lot, including what kind of things cause the climate change problem and global warming? How can people solve this problem? What will we lose if we do not solve it on time? At that time, I am inquisitive about how everything goes on after forty years. I am curious about whether people have begun to take action to solve it? Are there more natural disasters showing up in your time? 

                                       <br><br>

To answer these questions, I will tell you some detailed things that happened during 2020 and after 2020.
                                       <br><br>


In this year, Donald Trump lost his campaign because he did not control the spread of COVID-19 well. Due to his loss, the Green New Deal passed. People from all over the world began to focus on this question and keep on solving it. 
                                       <br><br>


For myself, I began to use a minimalist lifestyle to live in 2020. I bought things much less than in the past. I did a check-list to check what kind of stuff I have now. When I wanted to buy a new item, I would check that list first and think whether I already have it first. It is beneficial, which helped me to make my home more clean and tidy than before. Also, because of this kind of living style, I began to become happy much easier than before. I stopped pursuing the new fashion trend, stopped buying the most fashionable clothes, bags, and equipment, which saved a tremendous amount of money. I used the money I saved to buy a small apartment in the center of the city I lived in. 
                                       <br><br>


Also, I tried my best to become a vegetarian. Although I still ate some meat, the amount is much fewer than before! The beef I ate is only for ensuring I get enough protein and vitamins. This kind of lifestyle makes me much healthier than my peers. I also began to ride bicycles in most situations. If the destination is far away, I chose to use public transportation. 
                                       <br><br>


What’s more, after I got married, my husband and I did not want to give birth to a child, so we decided to adopt a child from an orphanage. However, we decided to subsidize all the kids from that orphanage. We took a bus to go to see the children every weekend and spent the whole day staying with them, teaching them some pieces of knowledge, doing sports with them, and bringing them some snacks. We told them about the importance of focusing on the problem of climate change. They are influenced by what they regularly see and hear. Two of this group of children selected the major that related to this problem when they entered the university. 
                                       <br><br>


Not only are we focusing on this problem, a massive amount of my friends and their friends are also living this kind of lifestyle. More and more people realize the importance of solving the problem of global warming and climate change. Thanks to this, a few natural disasters took place now, and we actually live in a really excellent living condition.

Dear future children, 
                                       <br><br>


              When you saw this letter, I believe it is already 2050. And I am expecting you to be able to read this letter written by me from 30 years ago, about the planet that we all have been living and are still living in right now. I hope, and I truly hope, at the time you are reading this, the plant that you are living is a sustainable, healthy and peaceful one to live with. And I wish that 30 years ago(the time I am writing this letter), the people in my generation and living at that year have started taking action on tackling the climate change problem seriously. So it saved you all from living on a disastrous planet. I hope we have already done something and did enough to give you all a good planet to live with. And here, let me tell you the story about our planet and environmental changes during my time in 2020…
                                       <br><br>


           As from what I’ve seen from real life, what I’ve learnt and heard about from the news, articles and from school, that I know climate changes have been happening back to years ago even before I was born. People are extracting more and more fossil fuels, and as we know they are running out fast only to support the growth of the economy and development of our technology. Yes, we were happy with the type of lives we were living. People were having good lives, making enough money to buy all types of things we could possibly have. But sadly, not a lot of people are aware of the outcome and bad impacts e..g the melting of icecaps, rise in sea levels, wildfires, extinction of animals,etc we imposed on our environment while we are doing all these things including. mass consumption of products, making waste, raising cattles, using cars and many more energy/electricities being provided,etc. Some of the people they do realize those impacts(even some don’t,still), but not a lot of people are actually willing to face and tackle the climate crisis we all were facing. Some even refused to admit the existence of such a crisis, such as those parties/organizations/firms/industry rely on fossil fuels to make money.

                                       <br><br>

          People start to ask, what does it mean to have a good life and to live happily on earth. Many of us were only caring about the current and short term happiness we were having. We often ignored the long term impacts environmental problems can cause on the planet in the future and how it would affect you all after so many years have passed. People were afraid of making changes.They were scared of losing the prosperous and happy and convenient type of life we’ve been having for a long time at this new age. But as what I have learnt from school and articles I read and movies we watched, they are ways for us to actually be possible to take on and to make a change on our individual actions and also as a whole collectively in society. 
                                       <br><br>


         I hope for example, more people will know about the idea of minimalism. That we will understand we are having an over-consumption pattern that we are driven by the idea to simply buy stuff not because we truly need it but just want it as promoted by the ideologies/all types of ads. I hope for example, not everyone will become a vegetarian, but a climatarian that when we eat,we choose what to eat to do good for our environment. I hope for example, we will not own too many cars but change to use more public transportation or even bike more so we will pollute less pollutants. I hope for example that we all take part in voting to vote for someone who has power to make changes on policies and lead us to taking the first steps to tackle the climate problems, for example, imposing carbon tax, take action based on Green New Deal. I truly hope, we all as part of the living species, recognize our responsibility as humans to protect the planet we all are living. Making it a sustainable planet with environmental justice to all other living species and other people living in the other part of the world. I hope the so-called making a change will not be something just said but taking real action on. I hope we as the people living in 2020 will start doing something to give you and your future childrens a planet that you all can live happily instead of facing all types of disasters caused by climate change.

                                       <br><br>

           Do you guys now have the planet to live with that we have promised you? If you do, I am so glad we did something to lead to such a good outcome. And I wish you and the future children can forever have such a sustainable planet that you are supposed to have. If you don’t I apologize to you. That we as the older generation are supposed to know all things back to so many years ago...but still...why no one is caring about and awring about this crisis.We could have done something to prevent all the bad things happening to you all during all these 30 years.
                                       <br><br>


       Here I want to tell you my children, that we are given such a beautiful planet to live on, then it is our responsibility to protect the planet we all shared. No matter how the planet has become in 2050, I wish you all to understand that our responsibility and actions are all tightly connected. Only if everyone is willing to understand the problem and willing to solve it, our planet can be lived on.


Love,                                       <br><br>

Mum                                        <br><br>
